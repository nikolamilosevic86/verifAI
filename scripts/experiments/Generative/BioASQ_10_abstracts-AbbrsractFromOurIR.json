OBJECTIVE(S) To investigate the potential role of 'a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type motifs-2 (ADAMTS-2), collagen type-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) and papilin' levels in the uterosacral ligament (USL) and cardinal ligament (CL) of the uterus on the etiopathogenesis of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) among postmenopausal women without stress urinary incontinence (SUI). STUDY DESIGN A total of 45 postmenopausal women, 22 diagnosed as POP stage III-IV and 23 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls referred for hysterectomy due to POP or benign gynecological disease, respectively, were recruited prospectively for our study. The biopsies of the USL and CL were obtained during hysterectomy. ADAMTS-2, collagen type-1, TIMP-3 and papilin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method after tissue homogenization. We excluded patients who smoked or presented with SUI. RESULTS There were no differences in terms of demographic features including age, BMI, obesity, duration of menopause, gravidity, parity, delivery modes and family history for POP between the POP and non-POP groups. Significant differences in the levels of ADAMTS-2, collagen type-1, TIMP-3 and papilin of USL were noted among the groups. Females with POP had lower levels of ADAMTS-2, collagen type-1, TIMP-3 and papilin in the USL compared to non-POP females. All investigated markers in the CL were also decreased in the POP group, but this relationship was not statistically significant. When age, duration of menopause, gravidity, parity and obesity were taken as covariates, only the USL papilin levels were negatively predictive for the development of POP. CONCLUSION(S) ADAMTS-2, collagen type-1, TIMP-3 and papilin levels of the USL play essential roles in the etiopathogenesis of POP among postmenopausal women without SUI. Moreover, significantly decreased USL papilin levels in females with POP suggest the importance of the USL and the impact of papilin on the development of POP."

Papilin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that we have found to be involved in, (1) thin matrix layers during gastrulation, (2) matrix associated with wandering, phagocytic hemocytes, (3) basement membranes and (4) space-filling matrix during Drosophila development. Determination of its cDNA sequence led to the identification of Caenorhabditis and mammalian papilins. A distinctly conserved 'papilin cassette' of domains at the amino-end of papilins is also the carboxyl-end of the ADAMTS subgroup of secreted, matrix-associated metalloproteinases; this cassette contains one thrombospondin type 1 (TSR) domain, a specific cysteine-rich domain and several partial TSR domains. In vitro, papilin non-competitively inhibits procollagen N-proteinase, an ADAMTS metalloproteinase. Inhibiting papilin synthesis in Drosophila or Caenorhabditis causes defective cell arrangements and embryonic death. Ectopic expression of papilin in Drosophila causes lethal abnormalities in muscle, Malpighian tubule and trachea formation. We suggest that papilin influences cell rearrangements and may modulate metalloproteinases during organogenesis."

A sulfated glycoprotein was isolated from the culture media of Drosophila Kc cells and named papilin. Affinity purified antibodies against this protein localized it primarily to the basement membranes of embryos. The antibodies cross-reacted with another material which was not sulfated and appeared to be the core protein of papilin, which is proteoglycan-like. After reduction, papilin electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a broad band of about 900,000 apparent molecular weight and the core protein as a narrow band of approximately 400,000. The core protein was formed by some cell lines and by other cells on incubation with 1 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl xyloside, which inhibited formation of the proteoglycan-like form. The buoyant density of papilin in CsCl/4 M guanidine hydrochloride is 1.4 g/ml, that of the core protein is much less. Papilin forms oligomers linked by disulfide bridges, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The protomer is a 225 +/- 15-nm thread which is disulfide-linked into a loop with fine, protruding thread ends. Oligomers form clover-leaf-like structures. The protein contains 22% combined serine and threonine residues and 25% combined aspartic and glutamic residues. 10 g of polypeptide has attached 6.4 g of glucosamine, 3.1 g of galactosamine, 6.1 g of uronic acid, and 2.7 g of neutral sugars. There are about 80 O-linked carbohydrate chains/core protein molecule. Sulfate is attached to these chains. The O-linkage is through an unidentified neutral sugar. Papilin is largely resistant to common glycosidases and several proteases. The degree of sulfation varies with the sulfate concentration of the incubation medium. This proteoglycan-like glycoprotein differs substantially from corresponding proteoglycans found in vertebrate basement membranes, in contrast to Drosophila basement membrane laminin and collagen IV which have been conserved evolutionarily."

Papilins are extracellular matrix proteins that share a particular, common order of types of protein domains.

We report that Drosophila, which has a compact genome, expresses three splice variants of papilin during embryogenesis in developmentally defined patterns. These isoforms have different numbers of Kunitz and IgC2 domains. The papilin isoforms are expressed in specific cell types and contribute to different extracellular matrices in gastrulation folds, early mesoderm, heart formation, basement membranes, and elaboration of the excorporeal peritrophic membrane that lines the gut. This finding indicates an unexpectedly broad spectrum of different pericellular matrices in Drosophila embryos.

The gonad arms of C. elegans hermaphrodites acquire invariant shapes by guided migrations of distal tip cells (DTCs), which occur in three phases that differ in the direction and basement membrane substrata used for movement. We found that mig-6 encodes long (MIG-6L) and short (MIG-6S) isoforms of the extracellular matrix protein papilin, each required for distinct aspects of DTC migration. Both MIG-6 isoforms have a predicted N-terminal papilin cassette, lagrin repeats and C-terminal Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitory domains. We show that mutations affecting MIG-6L specifically and cell-autonomously decrease the rate of post-embryonic DTC migration, mimicking a post-embryonic collagen IV deficit. We also show that MIG-6S has two separable functions - one in embryogenesis and one in the second phase of DTC migration. Genetic data suggest that MIG-6S functions in the same pathway as the MIG-17/ADAMTS metalloproteinase for guiding phase 2 DTC migrations, and MIG-17 is abnormally localized in mig-6 class-s mutants. Genetic data also suggest that MIG-6S and non-fibrillar network collagen IV play antagonistic roles to ensure normal phase 2 DTC guidance."

The extracellular matrix (ECM) determines functional properties of connective tissues through structural components, such as collagens, elastic fibers, or proteoglycans. The ECM also instructs cell behavior through regulatory proteins, including proteases, growth factors, and matricellular proteins, which can be soluble or tethered to ECM scaffolds. The secreted a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 repeats/motifs-like (ADAMTSL) proteins constitute a family of regulatory ECM proteins that are related to ADAMTS proteases, but lack their protease domains. In mammals, the ADAMTSL protein family is comprised of seven members, ADAMTSL1-6 and papilin. ADAMTSL orthologues are also present in the worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Like other matricellular proteins, ADAMTSL expression is characterized by tight spatio-temporal regulation during embryonic development and early postnatal growth and by cell type- and tissue-specific functional pleiotropy. While largely quiescent during adult tissue homeostasis, re-expression of ADAMTSL proteins is frequently observed in the context of physiological and pathological tissue remodeling and during regeneration and repair after injury. The diverse functions of ADAMTSL proteins are further evident from disorders caused by mutations in individual ADAMTSL proteins, which can affect multiple organ systems. In addition, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADAMTSL genes to complex traits, such as lung function, asthma, height, body mass, fibrosis, or schizophrenia. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about individual members of the ADAMTSL protein family and highlight recent mechanistic studies that began to elucidate their diverse functions."

Two contrasting substrates, Drosophila laminin and human vitronectin, caused determined primary Drosophila embryo cells to follow alternate intermediate differentiation steps without affecting the final outcome of differentiation. Integrin alpha PS2 beta PS3 was essential for the initial spreading of myocytes on vitronectin: focal contacts rich in beta PS3 integrins formed and were connected by actin- and myosin-containing stress fibers. While alpha PS2 beta PS3 was unnecessary for myotube formation on laminin, it was required for the subsequent change to a sarcomeric cytoarchitecture. The differentiating primary cultures synthesized integrins and assembled them into detergent-insoluble, cytoskeleton-associated complexes. Collagen IV, laminin, glutactin, papilin, and other extracellular matrix proteins were made primarily by hemocytes and were secreted into the medium. Further differentiation within the cultures was influenced by secreted components and by later addition of vitronectin or bovine serum. Comparison of the differentiation of various cell types on the two substrates showed that vitronectin provided a selective advantage for the differentiation of myocytes, with enrichment over epithelia, epidermal cells, and neurites."

BACKGROUND Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Rmi) a major cattle ectoparasite and tick borne disease vector, impacts on animal welfare and industry productivity. In arthropod research there is an absence of a complete Chelicerate genome, which includes ticks, mites, spiders, scorpions and crustaceans. Model arthropod genomes such as Drosophila and Anopheles are too taxonomically distant for a reference in tick genomic sequence analysis. This study focuses on the de-novo assembly of two R. microplus BAC sequences from the understudied R microplus genome. Based on available R. microplus sequenced resources and comparative analysis, tick genomic structure and functional predictions identify complex gene structures and genomic targets expressed during tick-cattle interaction. RESULTS In our BAC analyses we have assembled, using the correct positioning of BAC end sequences and transcript sequences, two challenging genomic regions. Cot DNA fractions compared to the BAC sequences confirmed a highly repetitive BAC sequence BM-012-E08 and a low repetitive BAC sequence BM-005-G14 which was gene rich and contained short interspersed elements (SINEs). Based directly on the BAC and Cot data comparisons, the genome wide frequency of the SINE Ruka element was estimated. Using a conservative approach to the assembly of the highly repetitive BM-012-E08, the sequence was de-convoluted into three repeat units, each unit containing an 18S, 5.8S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) encoding gene sequence (rDNA), related internal transcribed spacer and complex intergenic region.In the low repetitive BM-005-G14, a novel gene complex was found between to 2 genes on the same strand. Nested in the second intron of a large 9 Kb papilin gene was a helicase gene. This helicase overlapped in two exonic regions with the papilin. Both these genes were shown expressed in different tick life stage important in ectoparasite interaction with the host. Tick specific sequence differences were also determined for the papilin gene and the protein binding sites of the 18S subunit in a comparison to Bos taurus. CONCLUSION In the absence of a sequenced reference genome we have assembled two complex BAC sequences, characterised novel gene structure that was confirmed by gene expression and sequencing analyses. This is the first report to provide evidence for 2 eukaryotic genes with exon regions that overlap on the same strand, the first to describe Rhipicephalinae papilin, and the first to report the complete ribosomal DNA repeated unit sequence structure for ticks. The Cot data estimation of genome wide sequence frequency means this research will underpin future efforts for genome sequencing and assembly of the R. microplus genome."

Sertoli cells secrete plasminogen activators (PAs) on both sides of the blood-testis barrier, i.e., in the basal and apical compartments of the seminiferous tubules, whereas peritubular cells secrete plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a fast-acting and specific PA inhibitor. While it is likely that PAI-1 produced by peritubular cells counteracts the basal secretion of PA, the nature of the PA inhibitor acting in the apical compartment remains to be demonstrated. In the present study, we showed that Sertoli cells recovered from 20-day-old rats and cultured contained a transcript of 3-3.2 kilobases, which hybridized specifically to a PAI-1 cDNA probe (Northern blot). We verified that the observed PAI-1 transcript could not result solely from the peritubular cells (weakly contaminating the Sertoli cell cultures), by comparing PAI-1 mRNA levels of Sertoli and peritubular cells recovered from 20-day-old rats and cultured. We also demonstrated that cultured Sertoli cells secreted a protein that complexed with tissue-type PA (zymography), indicating that it was biologically active. This protein comigrated with purified PAI-1 as a doublet of 46 and 49 kDa (Western blot). The trophic hormone FSH decreased PAI-1 messenger RNA as well as immunoreactive PAI-1 protein (probably via the cAMP protein kinase A pathway), whereas transforming growth factor ss1 and basic fibroblast growth factor (in a nanomolar concentration) increased both of these. These observations support the hypothesis that PAI-1 is expressed by Sertoli cells and is under a complex hormonal (FSH) and paracrine and/or autocrine control exerted at least by basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor ss1."

The receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and its receptor RANK are critical regulators for immune responses as well as bone remodeling. RANKL is a type II transmembrane protein that has two forms-a membrane-anchored protein and a secreted protein. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time the kinetical expression of two forms of RANKL in human T cells using two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human RANKL, which we newly derived. Freshly isolated T cells rarely expressed mRANKL, while the activation of T cells induced a substantial but minimal level of mRANKL as well as the accumulation of considerable amounts of sRANKL. The addition of the metalloprotease inhibitor KB-R8301 efficiently suppressed the release of sRANKL from activated T cells or RANKL-transfectants, and reciprocally enhanced the mRANKL expression. The membrane form of RANKL was also expressed on the infiltrating T cells in the rheumatoid synovial fluid and in the gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis. Our results demonstrate that the expression of mRANKL on T cells is strictly limited, and the majority of RANKL protein produced by T cells may be active in the soluble form after shedding. The mAbs that were derived in this study may be useful for investigating the regulation and function of RANKL in immune responses and bone remodeling."

We identify a TNFSF11 transcript variant that extends the originally identified transcript encoding secreted RANKL. We demonstrate that this TNFSF11 transcript variant is expressed by the human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, and by both primary human T cells and Jurkat T cells. Of relevance to the production of RANKL in pathologic bone loss, expression of this secreted TNFSF11 transcript is upregulated in Jurkat T cells and primary human T cells upon activation. Furthermore, this transcript can be translated and secreted in Jurkat T cells in vitro and is able to support osteoclast differentiation. Our data highlight the complexity of the TNFSF11 genomic locus, and demonstrate the potential for the expression of alternate mRNA transcripts encoding membrane-bound and secreted forms of RANKL.

Myeloma cells can home to bone, triggering increased RANKL and decreased OPG expression by stromal cells, leading to osteolysis. Whether myeloma cells contribute directly to the pool of RANKL or OPG in bone has been contentious. Here we provide evidence of RANKL expression by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, demonstrating transcripts encoding both the membrane-bound and secreted forms of RANKL in five human multiple myeloma cell lines (LP-1, NCI-H929, OPM-2, RPMI8226, U266) and myeloma cells purified from bone marrow aspirates of myeloma patients. We demonstrated that RANKL encoding mRNAs are translated to protein by antibody detection of RANKL. In vitro assays showed that myeloma cells induced bone marrow derived mononuclear cells to differentiate into adherent tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase positive multinucleated cells, indicative of the formation of functional osteoclasts. This differentiation could also be achieved with passaged myeloma media alone, implicating secreted products. Finally, we provide evidence that the differentiation observed is at least in part the result of myeloma cell expression of RANKL. We therefore conclude that myeloma cells can directly contribute to the pool of RANKL in bone."

BACKGROUND Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an endotoxin and a vital component of gram-negative bacteria's outer membrane. During gram-negative bacterial sepsis, LPS regulates osteoclast differentiation and activity, in addition to increasing inflammation. This study aimed to investigate how LPS regulates osteoclast differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells in vitro. RESULTS Herein, we revealed that RAW cells failed to differentiate into mature osteoclasts in vitro in the presence of LPS. However, differentiation occurred in cells primed with receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa-\u0392 ligand (RANKL) for 24 h and then treated with LPS for 48 h (henceforth, denoted as LPS-treated cells). In cells treated with either RANKL or LPS, an increase in membrane levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) receptor was observed. Mechanistically, an inhibitor of TLR4 (TAK-242) reduced the number of osteoclasts as well as the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in LPS-treated cells. RANKL-induced RAW cells secreted a very basal level TNF-\u03b1. TAK-242 did not affect RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Increased osteoclast differentiation in LPS-treated osteoclasts was not associated with the RANKL/RANK/OPG axis but connected with the LPS/TLR4/TNF-\u03b1 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-2 axis. We postulate that this is because TAK-242 and a TNF-\u03b1 antibody suppress osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, an antibody against TNF-\u03b1 reduced membrane levels of TNFR-2. Secreted TNF-\u03b1 appears to function as an autocrine/ paracrine factor in the induction of osteoclastogenesis independent of RANKL. CONCLUSION TNF-\u03b1 secreted via LPS/TLR4 signaling regulates osteoclastogenesis in macrophages primed with RANKL and then treated with LPS. Our findings suggest that TLR4/TNF-\u03b1 might be a potential target to suppress bone loss associated with inflammatory bone diseases, including periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis."

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is elevated in MM patients and is associated with MM-induced bone disease, although the mechanism by which HGF promotes bone disease remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that HGF induces RANKL expression in osteoblasts and BMSCs, and investigated the mechanism of induction. We found that HGF and MM cell supernatants induced RANKL expression in ST2 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, and mouse BMSCs. In addition, HGF increased phosphorylation of Met and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in ST2 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, or mouse BMSCs. Moreover, Met and NF-\u03baB inhibitors suppressed HGF-induced RANKL expression in ST2 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, and mouse BMSCs.

Continuous parathyroid hormone (PTH) blocks its own osteogenic actions in marrow stromal cell cultures by inducing Cox2 and receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) in the osteoblastic lineage cells, which then cause the hematopoietic lineage cells to secrete an inhibitor of PTH-stimulated osteoblast differentiation. To identify this inhibitor, we used bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and primary osteoblasts (POBs) from WT and Cox2 knock-out (KO) mice. Conditioned medium (CM) from RANKL-treated WT, but not KO, BMMs blocked PTH-stimulated cAMP production in POBs. Inhibition was reversed by pertussis toxin (PTX), which blocks G\u03b1i/o activation. Saa3 was the most highly differentially expressed gene in a microarray comparison of RANKL-treated WT versus Cox2 KO BMMs, and RANKL induced Saa3 protein secretion only from WT BMMs. CM from RANKL-stimulated BMMs with Saa3 knockdown did not inhibit PTH-stimulated responses in POBs. SAA added to POBs inhibited PTH-stimulated cAMP responses, which was reversed by PTX. Selective agonists and antagonists of formyl peptide receptor 2 (Fpr2) suggested that Fpr2 mediated the inhibitory actions of Saa3 on osteoblasts. In BMMs committed to become osteoclasts by RANKL treatment, Saa3 expression peaked prior to appearance of multinucleated cells. Flow sorting of WT marrow revealed that Saa3 was secreted only from the RANKL-stimulated B220(-) CD3(-)CD11b(-/low) CD115(+) preosteoclast population. We conclude that Saa3 secretion from preosteoclasts, induced by RANKL in a Cox2-dependent manner, inhibits PTH-stimulated cAMP signaling and osteoblast differentiation via G\u03b1i/o signaling. The induction of Saa3 by PTH may explain the suppression of bone formation when PTH is applied continuously and may be a new therapeutic target for osteoporosis."

Understanding of osteoclast formation and activation has advanced considerably since the discovery of the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the mid 1990s. Osteoblasts and stromal stem cells express receptor activator of NF-jB ligand (RANKL), which binds to its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. This regulates the differentiation of precursors into multinucleated osteoclasts and osteoclast activation and survival both normally and in most pathologic conditions associated with increased bone resorption. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is secreted by osteoblasts and osteogenic stromal stem cells and protects the skeleton from excessive bone resorption by binding to RANKL and preventing it from interacting with RANK. The RANKL/OPG ratio in bone marrow is thus an important determinant of bone mass in normal and disease states. RANKL/RANK signaling also regulates lymph node formation and mammary gland lactational hyperplasia in mice, and OPG protects large arteries of mice from medial calcification. This article reviews the roles of the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in bone and other tissues."

Recently, receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) was shown to be necessary for osteoclast formation. We now report that activin A, a cytokine enriched in bone matrix and secreted by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, powerfully synergized with RANKL for induction of osteoclast-like cells (OCL) from bone marrow precursors depleted of stromal cells. Moreover, OCL formation in RANKL was virtually abolished by soluble type II A activin receptors (ActR-II(A)), suggesting that activin A is essential for OCL formation. Activin A was most effective when precursors were exposed to RANKL and activin A simultaneously: resistance to OCL-induction that occurs when precursors are pre-incubated in M-CSF was reduced. Incubation on bone matrix also enhanced the sensitivity of precursors to OCL-induction by RANKL; and this was prevented by soluble ActR-II(A). Thus, activin A in bone matrix, or released from osteoblastic or other cells, enhances the osteoclast-forming potential of precursors and synergizes with RANKL in inducing osteoclastic differentiation."

This function is evolutionary conserved and place pDC in critical position in the innate immune response to virus. Here we show that rat pDC constitutively express TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE) also known as Receptor-activating NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL). TRANCE/RANKL is a member of the TNF superfamily which plays a central role in osteoclastogenesis through its interaction with its receptor RANK. TRANCE/RANK interaction are also involved in lymphoid organogenesis as well as T cell/DC cross talk. Unlike conventional DC, rat CD4(high) pDC were shown to constitutively express TRANCE/RANKL both at the mRNA and the surface protein level. TRANCE/RANKL was also induced on the CD4(low) subsets of pDC following activation by CpG. The secreted form of TRANCE/RANKL was also produced by rat pDC. Of note, levels of mRNA, surface and secreted TRANCE/RANKL expression were similar to that observed for activated T cells. TRANCE/RANKL expression was found on pDC in all lymphoid organs as well blood and BM with a maximum expression in mesenteric lymph nodes. Despite this TRANCE/RANKL expression, we were unable to demonstrate in vitro osteoclastogenesis activity for rat pDC. Taken together, these data identifies pDC as novel source of TRANCE/RANKL in the immune system."

Bone is continuously remodeled through resorption by osteoclasts and the subsequent synthesis of the bone matrix by osteoblasts. Cell-to-cell contact between osteoblasts and osteoclast precursors is required for osteoclast formation. RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand) expressed on osteoblastic cell membranes stimulates osteoclastogenesis, while osteoprotegerin (OPG) secreted by osteoblasts inhibits osteoclastogenesis. Although polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been implicated in bone homeostasis, the effects thereof on OPG and RANKL secretion have not been investigated. MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were exposed to the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) and the n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); furthermore, the bone-active hormone parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the effects thereof were tested on OPG and RANKL secretion. Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), a product of AA metabolism that was previously implicated in bone homeostasis, was included in the study. AA (5.0-20 microg/ml) inhibited OPG secretion by 25-30%, which was attenuated by pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase blocker indomethacin, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of AA on OPG could possibly be PGE(2)-mediated. MC3T3-E1 cells secreted very low basal levels of RANKL, but AA stimulated RANKL secretion, thereby decreasing the OPG/RANKL ratio. DHA suppressed OPG secretion to a smaller extent than AA. This could, however, be due to endogenous PGE(2) production. No RANKL could be detected after exposing the MC3T3-E1 cells to DHA. PTH did not affect OPG secretion, but stimulated RANKL secretion. This study demonstrates that AA and PTH reduce the OPG/RANKL ratio and may increase osteoclastogenesis. DHA, however, had no significant effect on OPG or RANKL in this model."

Recent studies have revealed a second class of gap-junction-forming proteins in vertebrates.

Pannexin1 is expressed in diverse tissues including the central nervous system and seems to form gap junction channels in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Since protein interacting partners have frequently been described for connexins, the most prominent family of gap junction forming proteins, we thus started to search for candidate genes of pannexin interacting partners. Kvbeta3, a protein belonging to the family of regulatory beta-subunits of the voltage-dependent potassium channels, was identified as a binding partner of pannexin1 in an E. coli two-hybrid system. This result was verified by confocal laser scanning microscopy using double transfected Neuro2A cells.

In the present study, we investigated whether pannexin1 plays a role in acute drug-induced liver toxicity. Hepatic expression of pannexin1 was characterized in a mouse model of acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. Subsequently, mice were overdosed with acetaminophen followed by treatment with the pannexin1 channel inhibitor 10Panx1. Sampling was performed 1, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h after acetaminophen administration. Evaluation of the effects of pannexin1 channel inhibition was based on a number of clinically relevant readouts, including protein adduct formation, measurement of aminotransferase activity and histopathological examination of liver tissue as well as on a series of markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and regeneration. Although no significant differences were found in histopathological analysis, pannexin1 channel inhibition reduced serum levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase. This was paralleled by a reduced amount of neutrophils recruited to the liver. Furthermore, alterations in the oxidized status were noticed with upregulation of glutathione levels upon suppression of pannexin1 channel opening. Concomitant promotion of regenerative activity was detected as judged on increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein quantities in 10Panx1-treated mice. Pannexin1 channels are important actors in liver injury triggered by acetaminophen.

Epithelial wound healing is essential to repair the corneal barrier function after injury and requires coordinated epithelial sheet movement over the wounded region.

We hypothesize that pannexin1 is dysregulated, and the interaction of two ion-channel proteins (P2X7 and pannexin1) is altered in pretype 2 diabetic tissue. Pannexin1 was found to be present along cell borders in unwounded tissue, and no significant difference was observed between DiO and B6 control. However, an epithelial debridement induced a striking difference in pannexin1 localization. The B6 control epithelium displayed intense staining near the leading edge, which is the region where calcium mobilization was detected, whereas the staining in the DiO corneal epithelium was diffuse and lacked distinct gradation in intensity back from the leading edge. Cells distal to the wound in the DiO tissue were irregular in shape, and the morphology was similar to that of epithelium inhibited with 10Panx, a pannexin1 inhibitor. Pannexin1 inhibition reduced mobilization of calcium between cells near the leading edge, and MATLAB scripts revealed a reduction in cell-cell communication that was also detected in cultured cells. Proximity ligation was performed to determine if P2X7 and pannexin1 interaction was a necessary component of motility and communication. While there was no significant difference in the interaction in unwounded DiO and B6 control corneal epithelium, there was significantly less interaction in the wounded DiO corneas both near the wound and back from the edge. The results demonstrate that pannexin1 contributes to the healing response, and P2X7 and pannexin1 coordination may be a required component of cell-cell communication and an underlying reason for the lack of pathologic tissue migration."

Pannexin1 channels are put forward as interesting drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19 due to their key role in inflammation and their link to other viral infections. In the present study, we selected a panel of drugs previously tested in clinical trials as potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 early on in the pandemic, including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, dexamethasone, ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, and ritonavir. The effect of the drugs on pannexin1 channels was assessed at a functional level by means of measurement of extracellular ATP release. Immunoblot analysis and real-time quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to study the potential of the drugs to alter pannexin1 protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively. Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and the combination of lopinavir with ritonavir were found to inhibit pannexin1 channel activity without affecting pannexin1 protein or mRNA levels.

Pannexin1 was widely expressed in the CNS by neuronal cell types but not glial cells, except for Bergmann glial cells of the cerebellar cortex. Cells positive to Ca-binding proteins, principally parvalbumin, but also calbindin and calretinin, as well as glutamate decarboxylase 67 kDa isoform, were pannexin1-positive. Pannexin1 labeling was found in cells which are known to exhibit spontaneous and synchronous discharge, such as neurons of the inferior olivary complex and the reticular thalamic nucleus, and also in neurons whose electrical activity is not coupled with neighboring cells, such as motoneurons of the spinal cord. The analysis of cellular localization showed puncta that surrounded cell bodies (e.g. the pyramidal cells of hippocampus) or restricted areas inside the cell bodies (e.g. the spinal motoneurons). In Bergmann glial cells the staining was present as fine grains that covered a large part of the cellular surface. Pannexin1 stained cells that previous studies have reported as expressing connexin36, another protein forming gap junction channels. Thus, it was possible that these two proteins could be integrated in the same functions. Since connexin36 expression levels change after seizures, we examined the expression of both pannexin1 and connexin36 in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and brain stem at different time intervals (2, 4 and 8 h) after i.p. injection of 4-aminopyridine, which resulted in systemic seizures. The only modification of the expression levels observed in this study concerned the progressive decrement of the connexin36 in the hippocampus, while pannexin1 expression was unchanged. This finding suggested that pannexin1 and connexin36 are involved in different functional roles or that they are expressed in different cell types and that only those expressing the Cx36 are induced to apoptosis by epileptic seizures."

In this study, it was investigated whether pannexin1 plays a role in acute liver failure and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, being prototypical acute and chronic liver pathologies, respectively, both featured by liver damage, oxidative stress and inflammation. To this end, wild-type and pannexin1-/- mice were overdosed with acetaminophen for 1, 6, 24 or 48h or were fed a choline-deficient high-fat diet for 8weeks.

In parallel, in order to elucidate molecular pathways affected by pannexin1 deletion as well as to mechanistically anchor the clinical observations, whole transcriptome analysis of liver tissue was performed. The results of this study show that pannexin1-/- diseased mice present less liver damage and oxidative stress, while inflammation was only decreased in pannexin1-/- mice in which non-alcoholic steatohepatitis was induced.

BACKGROUND The opening of pannexin1 channels is considered as a key event in inflammation. Pannexin1 channel-mediated release of adenosine triphosphate triggers inflammasome signaling and activation of immune cells. By doing so, pannexin1 channels play an important role in several inflammatory diseases. Although pannexin1 channel inhibition could represent a novel clinical strategy for treatment of inflammatory disorders, therapeutic pannexin1 channel targeting is impeded by the lack of specific, potent and/or in vivo-applicable inhibitors. The goal of this study is to generate nanobody-based inhibitors of pannexin1 channels. RESULTS Pannexin1-targeting nanobodies were developed as potential new pannexin1 channel inhibitors. We identified 3 cross-reactive nanobodies that showed affinity for both murine and human pannexin1 proteins. Flow cytometry experiments revealed binding capacities in the nanomolar range. Moreover, the pannexin1-targeting nanobodies were found to block pannexin1 channel-mediated release of adenosine triphosphate. The pannexin1-targeting nanobodies were also demonstrated to display anti-inflammatory effects in vitro through reduction of interleukin 1 beta amounts. This anti-inflammatory outcome was reproduced in vivo using a human-relevant mouse model of acute liver disease relying on acetaminophen overdosing. More specifically, the pannexin1-targeting nanobodies lowered serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and diminished liver damage. These effects were linked with alteration of the expression of several NLRP3 inflammasome components. CONCLUSIONS This study introduced for the first time specific, potent and in vivo-applicable nanobody-based inhibitors of pannexin1 channels. As demonstrated for the case of liver disease, the pannexin1-targeting nanobodies hold great promise as anti-inflammatory agents, yet this should be further tested for extrahepatic inflammatory disorders. Moreover, the pannexin1-targeting nanobodies represent novel tools for fundamental research regarding the role of pannexin1 channels in pathological and physiological processes."

Emerging evidence suggests that inflammation mediated by the pannexin1 channel contributes significantly to acute ischemic stroke. It is believed that the pannexin1 channel is key in initiating central system inflammation during the early stages of acute ischemic stroke. Moreover, the pannexin1 channel is involved in the inflammatory cascade to maintain the inflammation levels. Specifically, the interaction of pannexin1 channels with ATP-sensitive P2X7 purinoceptors or promotion of potassium efflux mediates the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, triggering the release of pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1 and IL-18, exacerbating and sustaining inflammation of brain. Also, increased release of ATP induced by cerebrovascular injury activates pannexin1 in vascular endothelial cells. This signal directs peripheral leukocytes to migrate into ischemic brain tissue, leading to an expansion of the inflammatory zone. Intervention strategies targeting pannexin1 channels may greatly alleviate inflammation after acute ischemic stroke to improve this patient population's clinical outcomes. In this review, we sought to summarize relevant studies on inflammation mediated by the pannexin1 channel in acute ischemic stroke and discussed the possibility of using brain organoid-on-a-chip technology to screen miRNAs that exclusively target the pannexin1 channel to provide new therapeutic measures for targeted regulation of pannexin1 channel to reduce inflammation in acute ischemic stroke."

BACKGROUND Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are highly constrained elements of mammalian genomes, whose functional role has not been completely elucidated yet. Previous studies have shown that some of them act as enhancers in mouse, while some others are expressed in both normal and cancer-derived human tissues. Only one UCE element so far was shown to present these two functions concomitantly, as had been observed in other isolated instances of single, non ultraconserved enhancer elements. RESULTS We used a custom microarray to assess the levels of UCE transcription during mouse development and integrated these data with published microarray and next-generation sequencing datasets as well as with newly produced PCR validation experiments. We show that a large fraction of non-exonic UCEs is transcribed across all developmental stages examined from only one DNA strand. Although the nature of these transcripts remains a mistery, our meta-analysis of RNA-Seq datasets indicates that they are unlikely to be short RNAs and that some of them might encode nuclear transcripts. In the majority of cases this function overlaps with the already established enhancer function of these elements during mouse development. Utilizing several next-generation sequencing datasets, we were further able to show that the level of expression observed in non-exonic UCEs is significantly higher than in random regions of the genome and that this is also seen in other regions which act as enhancers. CONCLUSION Our data shows that the concurrent presence of enhancer and transcript function in non-exonic UCE elements is more widespread than previously shown. Moreover through our own experiments as well as the use of next-generation sequencing datasets, we were able to show that the RNAs encoded by non-exonic UCEs are likely to be long RNAs transcribed from only one DNA strand."

About one-half of these Drosophila UCEs overlap the transcribed portion of genes, with many of those that are within coding sequences likely to correspond to sites of ADAR-dependent RNA editing. For the remaining UCEs that are in nongenic regions, we find that many are potentially capable of forming RNA secondary structures.

BACKGROUND Ultraconserved elements of DNA have been identified in vertebrate and invertebrate genomes. These elements have been found to have diverse functions, including enhancer activities in developmental processes. The evolutionary origins and functional roles of these elements in cellular systems, however, have not yet been determined. RESULTS Here, we identified a wide range of ultraconserved elements common to distant species, from primitive aquatic organisms to terrestrial species with complicated body systems, including some novel elements conserved in fruit fly and human. In addition to a well-known association with developmental genes, these DNA elements have a strong association with genes implicated in essential cell functions, such as epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, detoxification, innate immunity, and sensory reception. Interestingly, we observed that ultraconserved elements clustered by sequence similarity. Furthermore, species composition and flanking genes of clusters showed lineage-specific patterns. Ultraconserved elements are highly enriched with binding sites to developmental transcription factors regardless of how they cluster. CONCLUSION We identified large numbers of ultraconserved elements across distant species. Specific classes of these conserved elements seem to have been generated before the divergence of taxa and fixed during the process of evolution. Our findings indicate that these ultraconserved elements are not the exclusive property of higher modern eukaryotes, but rather transmitted from their metazoan ancestors."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than ~200 nucleotides with little or no protein-coding capacity. Growing evidence shows that lncRNAs present important function in development and are associated with many human diseases such as cancers, Alzheimer disease, and heart diseases. Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) transcripts are a novel class of lncRNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions (UCRs). UCRs are absolutely conserved (100%) between the orthologous regions of the human, rat, and mouse genomes. The UCRs are frequently located at fragile sites and at genomic regions involved in cancers. Recent data suggest that T-UCRs are altered at the transcriptional level in human tumorigenesis and the aberrant T-UCRs expression profiles can be used to differentiate human cancer types. The profound understanding of T-UCRs can throw new light on the pathogenesis of human cancers."

Ultraconserved elements are stretches of consecutive nucleotides that are perfectly conserved in multiple mammalian genomes. Although these sequences are identical in the reference human, mouse, and rat genomes, we identified numerous polymorphisms within these regions in the human population. To determine whether polymorphisms in ultraconserved elements affect fitness, we genotyped unrelated human DNA samples at loci within these sequences. For all single-nucleotide polymorphisms tested in ultraconserved regions, individuals homozygous for derived alleles (alleles that differ from the rodent reference genomes) were present, viable, and healthy. The distribution of allele frequencies in these samples argues against strong, ongoing selection as the force maintaining the conservation of these sequences. We then used two methods to determine the minimum level of selection required to generate these sequences. Despite the lack of fixed differences in these sequences between humans and rodents, the average level of selection on ultraconserved elements is less than that on essential genes. The strength of selection associated with ultraconserved elements suggests that mutations in these regions may have subtle phenotypic consequences that are not easily detected in the laboratory."

Gaining a genomic perspective on phylogeny requires the collection of data from many putatively independent loci across the genome. Among insects, an increasingly common approach to collecting this class of data involves transcriptome sequencing, because few insects have high-quality genome sequences available; assembling new genomes remains a limiting factor; the transcribed portion of the genome is a reasonable, reduced subset of the genome to target; and the data collected from transcribed portions of the genome are similar in composition to the types of data with which biologists have traditionally worked (e.g. exons). However, molecular techniques requiring RNA as a template, including transcriptome sequencing, are limited to using very high-quality source materials, which are often unavailable from a large proportion of biologically important insect samples. Recent research suggests that DNA-based target enrichment of conserved genomic elements offers another path to collecting phylogenomic data across insect taxa, provided that conserved elements are present in and can be collected from insect genomes. Here, we identify a large set (n = 1510) of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) shared among the insect order Hymenoptera. We used in silico analyses to show that these loci accurately reconstruct relationships among genome-enabled hymenoptera, and we designed a set of RNA baits (n = 2749) for enriching these loci that researchers can use with DNA templates extracted from a variety of sources. We used our UCE bait set to enrich an average of 721 UCE loci from 30 hymenopteran taxa, and we used these UCE loci to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships spanning very old (\u2265220 Ma) to very young (\u22641 Ma) divergences among hymenopteran lineages. In contrast to a recent study addressing hymenopteran phylogeny using transcriptome data, we found ants to be sister to all remaining aculeate lineages with complete support, although this result could be explained by factors such as taxon sampling. We discuss this approach and our results in the context of elucidating the evolutionary history of one of the most diverse and speciose animal orders."

Specifically, while T-UCstem1::miR-9 cytoplasmic interplay regulates ESC proliferation by reducing miR-9 levels, nuclear T-UCstem1 maintains ESC self-renewal and transcriptional identity by stabilizing polycomb repressive complex 2 on bivalent domains. Altogether, our findings provide unprecedented evidence that T-UCEs regulate physiological cellular functions and point to an essential role of T-UCstem1 in preserving ESC identity."

Objective To study the genetic defect that causes this complex phenotype and dissect the molecular mechanism underlying this syndrome through functional analysis. Methods Mutational study by DNA sequencing, generation of expression vectors, site-directed mutagenesis, protein-DNA-binding assays, luciferase reporter gene assays, confocal microscopy, coimmunoprecipitation, and bioinformatics analysis. Results We identified a mutation [p.(Val75Glyfs*334)] in the amino-terminal domain of the NKX2-1 gene, which was functionally compared with a previously identified mutation [p.(Ala276Argfs*75)] in the carboxy-terminal domain in other patients with BLTS but without signs of respiratory distress. Both mutations showed similar protein expression profiles, subcellular localization, and deleterious effects on thyroid-, brain-, and lung-specific promoter activity. Coexpression of the coactivator TAZ/WWTR1 (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif/WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1) restored the transactivation properties of p.(Ala276Argfs*75) but not p.(Val75Glyfs*334) NKX2-1 on a lung-specific promoter, although both NKX2-1 mutants could interact equally with TAZ/WWTR1. The retention of residual transcriptional activity in the carboxy-terminal mutant, which was absent in the amino-terminal mutant, allowed the functional rescue by TAZ/WWTR1.

SGLT2 inhibitors are an insulin-independent class of oral antihyperglycemic medication that clinicians use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Multiple landmark clinical trials support the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing blood glucose levels, but it is important to understand when to properly utilize them. SGLT2 inhibitors are the most beneficial as an adjunct medication in addition to metformin in patients with a history of cardiovascular or renal disease who need further hemoglobin A1c reduction. The novel mechanism of action also demands clinicians be aware of the side effects not typically experienced with other oral antihyperglycemic drugs, such as genital tract infections, lower leg amputations, electrolyte disturbances and bone fractures. On top of their benefits in type 2 diabetes, novel uses for SGLT2 inhibitors are being uncovered. Diabetic patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, who are at an increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, experience a clinically significant reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase levels. SGLT2 inhibitors are also effective at lowering body weight in obese individuals and decreasing systolic blood pressure.

To understand how net prices (after rebates and other discounts) respond to competition, we compared changes in inflation-adjusted, revenue-weighted mean list and net prices of a one-month supply of three classes of diabetes drugs: glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. These drug classes each had several brand-name products enter the market between 2005 and 2017. The annualized change in list price over this period was $75 (15 percent) for GLP1 agonists, $22 (8 percent) for DPP4 inhibitors, and $41 (11 percent) for SGLT2 inhibitors. In contrast, the annualized change in net price was $38 (10 percent) for GLP1 agonists, -$3 (-2 percent) for DPP4 inhibitors, and -$17 (-9 percent) for SGLT2 inhibitors, suggesting a variable impact of brand-name competition on net prices."

INTRODUCTION Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2) are an increasingly administered class of medication used to lower blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and Fournier's gangrene are rare, but potentially catastrophic side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. This manuscript reports a case of both DKA and Fournier's gangrene in the context of SGLT2 inhibitor use. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 51-year-old morbidly obese man with hypertension and poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus presented to the emergency department with a clinical presentation consistent with Fournier's gangrene. He was promptly taken to the operating room by the urology team where he had extensive debridement of the perineum and abdomen. Intra-operatively he was found to have DKA, which was managed appropriately. The acidosis and Fournier's gangrene were deemed a likely side effect of SGLT2 inhibitor use. After a thirty-day hospital admission, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility where he is progressing well. His SGLT2 inhibitor was discontinued upon admission to hospital. DISCUSSION Perioperative providers should have a high index of suspicion for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and Fournier's gangrene in patients prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors. Prompt treatment of DKA through correction of underlying triggers, aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin to close the anion gap, and appropriate potassium repletion is vital to optimize patient outcomes. CONCLUSION The use of SGLT2 inhibitors among surgical populations is increasing. This case highlights the importance of being aware of the mechanism and side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, and the management of DKA."

Orally applied SGLT2 (SLC5A2) inhibitors that enter the blood and decrease renal reabsorption of glucose have been approved as antidiabetic drugs. They decrease blood glucose levels, slightly reduce body weight and blood pressure, and decrease the risk for diabetic nephropathy. The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin has been shown to reduce the risk of severe cardiac failure. This review summarizes knowledge about the functions of SGLT2 and the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and diabetic follow-up diseases. In addition, proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of therapeutic effects and of side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are described. A recently investigated strategy to employ orally applied SGLT1 (SLC5A1) inhibitors for treatment of diabetes is discussed. The SGLT1 inhibitors reduce glucose absorption and decrease blood glucose excursions after the intake of glucose-rich food. Knowledge concerning the expression of SGLT1 in different organs is compiled and potential side effects of SGLT1 inhibitors entering the blood are discussed. Because selective targeting of SGLT1 expression presents a strategy to decrease SGLT1-mediated glucose absorption, current knowledge about the regulation of SGLT1 is also discussed. This includes the possibility to decrease SGLT1 abundance in the small intestinal brush-border membrane by a peptide derived from protein RS1 (RSC1A1) that regulates membrane trafficking. Finally the possibility to employ SGLT1 and SGLT2 as targets for anticancer therapy is discussed. SGLT1 and SGLT2 are expressed in various tumors where they supply the tumor cells with glucose for euglycemic glycolysis. Tumor growth of carcinoma expressing SGLT2 can be slowed down by an SGLT2 inhibitor."

PURPOSE Both heart failure and its treatment with diuretics or SGLT2 inhibitors increase fall risk in older adults. Therefore, decisions to continue or deprescribe diuretics or SGLT2 inhibitors in older heart failure patients who have fallen are generally highly complex and challenging for clinicians. However, a comprehensive overview of information required for rationale and safe decision-making is lacking. The aim of this clinical review was to assist clinicians in safe (de)prescribing of these drug classes in older heart failure patients. METHODS We comprehensively searched and summarized published literature and international guidelines on the efficacy, fall-related safety issues, and deprescribing of the commonly prescribed diuretics and SGLT2 inhibitors in older adults. RESULTS Both diuretics and SGLT2 inhibitors potentially cause various fall-related adverse effects. Their fall-related side effect profiles partly overlap (e.g., tendency to cause hypotension), but there are also important differences; based on the currently available evidence of this relatively new drug class, SGLT2 inhibitors seem to have a favorable fall-related adverse effect profile compared to diuretics (e.g., low/absent tendency to cause hyperglycemia or electrolyte abnormalities, low risk of worsening chronic kidney disease). In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors have potential beneficial effects (e.g., disease-modifying effects in heart failure, renoprotective effects), whereas diuretic effects are merely symptomatic. CONCLUSION (De)prescribing diuretics and SGLT2 inhibitors in older heart failure patients who have fallen is often highly challenging, but this clinical review paper assists clinicians in individualized and patient-centered rational clinical decision-making: we provide a summary of available literature on efficacy and (subclass-specific) safety profiles of diuretics and SGLT2 inhibitors, and practical guidance on safe (de)prescribing of these drugs (e.g. a clinical decision tree for deprescribing diuretics in older adults who have fallen)."

BACKGROUND Everolimus (Certican), a novel proliferation signal inhibitor, allows calcineurin inhibitor dose reduction in transplant patients, minimizing risk of nephrotoxicity without loss of immunosuppressive efficacy. As a result of its mode of action, this class of agent (i.e., everolimus and sirolimus) is associated with certain adverse events (e.g., lymphocele, arthralgia, edema and hyperlipidemia). METHODS Three case studies from within an everolimus Phase III trial (A2306) are presented with the aim of illustrating how treatment-related adverse events can be managed. RESULTS The combination of everolimus with reduced-exposure cyclosporine was efficacious in these patients. One experienced mild acute rejection that was managed with steroid boluses. All have acceptable graft function during follow-up to date. Moderate lymphocele either resolved spontaneously or was easily managed by povidine-iodine instillations. One patient developed serious early lymphocele that, unusually, required surgical intervention. Everolimus dose reduction or withdrawal was not necessary to effectively manage lymphocele of any severity. A case of bilateral multiple arthralgia was effectively managed with everolimus dose reduction, but still maintained everolimus trough blood levels at approximately 3 ng/ml. Eyelid and ankle edemas were also easily managed with low dose furosemide, preferably coupled with cyclosporine and everolimus dose reduction. Hyperlipidemia responded to statin therapy. CONCLUSIONS Everolimus-related adverse events can be effectively managed either with other treatments or, where necessary, by everolimus dose reduction, without loss of efficacy. Discontinuing everolimus therapy is generally not necessary."

The calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) have been the cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy in recent years, though their association with dose-related nephrotoxicity is a major factor in the development of chronic allograft nephropathy in kidney transplant recipients. The novel proliferation signal inhibitor everolimus (Certican) has a mode of action distinct and complementary to the CNIs, which is thought to underlie the demonstrated synergy between everolimus and cyclosporine (CsA) in preclinical models. This finding suggests that everolimus may allow for CNI dose reduction, enabling nephrotoxicity to be minimized without compromising efficacy. Two prospective, multicenter, randomized studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of everolimus (1.5 or 3.0 mg/day) combined with reduced-exposure CsA (Neoral) in de novo renal transplant patients. In these studies, the everolimus trough level was maintained at > or =3 ng/ml with therapeutic drug monitoring and the CsA dose optimized with C(2) monitoring. The incidence of efficacy failure with this regimen was shown to be comparable with that provided by regimens employing full-dose CNIs, but with good renal function. Furthermore, everolimus (trough levels 3-8 ng/ml) plus reduced-exposure CsA was associated with a marked reduction in acute rejection compared with regimens using fixed-dose everolimus or mycophenolate mofetil plus full-dose CsA. At 12 months follow-up, CsA trough level was 57% lower in these trials than in previous trials in which patients received full-dose CsA. This suggests that concentration-controlled everolimus can be successfully combined with optimized administration of CsA and that this regimen may maximize immunosuppression, whilst preserving renal function."

Fusarochromanone is an experimental drug with unique and potent anti-cancer activity. Current cancer therapies often incorporate a combination of drugs to increase efficacy and decrease the development of drug resistance. In this study, we used drug combinations and cellular phenotypic screens to address important questions about FC101's mode of action and its potential therapeutic synergies in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). We hypothesized that FC101's activity against TNBC is similar to the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, because FC101 downregulates the phosphorylation of two mTOR substrates, S6K and S6. Since everolimus synergistically enhances the anti-cancer activities of two known EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib or lapatinib) in TNBC, we performed analogous studies with FC101. Phenotypic cellular assays helped assess whether FC101 acts similarly to everolimus, in both single and combination treatments with the two inhibitors. FC101 outperformed all other single treatments in both cell proliferation and viability assays. However, unlike everolimus, FC101 produced a sustained decrease in cell viability in drug washout studies. None of the other drugs were able to maintain comparable effects upon removal. Although we observed slightly additive effects when the TNBC cells were treated with FC101 and the two EGFR inhibitors, those effects were not truly synergistic in the manner displayed with everolimus."

BACKGROUND The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus is approved as an antitumor agent in advanced estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Surrogate bone marker data from clinical trials suggest effects on bone metabolism, but the mode of action of everolimus in bone biology remains unclear. In this study, we assessed potential bone-protective effects of everolimus in the context of osteotropic tumors. METHODS The effects of everolimus on cancer cell viability in vitro and on tumor growth in vivo were assessed. Everolimus-regulated osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis were also assessed in vitro before we assessed the bone-protective effect of everolimus in a model where bone loss was induced in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. Finally, the role of everolimus in the progression of osteolytic bone disease was assessed in an intracardiac model of breast cancer bone metastases. RESULTS At low concentrations (1 nM) in vitro, everolimus reduced the viability of human and murine cancer cell lines and impaired the osteoclastogenesis of osteoclast progenitors as assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and counting tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive, multinucleated osteoclasts (p < 0.001). Everolimus had little or no deleterious effect on osteoblastogenesis in vitro, with concentrations of 1 and 10 nM increasing the messenger RNA expression of osteoblast marker genes (p \u2264 0.05) and leaving mineralization in differentiated human mesenchymal stem cells unchanged. Everolimus treatment (1 mg/kg body weight/day) prevented the bone loss observed in OVX mice and concurrently inhibited the metastatic growth of MDA-MB-231 cells by 70% (p < 0.002) while preserving bone mass in an intracardiac model of bone metastasis. CONCLUSIONS These results underline the antitumor effects of everolimus and highlight its bone-protective efficacy, warranting further research on the potential implications on bone health in populations prone to osteoporosis and bone metastases, such as postmenopausal women with breast cancer."

Whereas everolimus-induced proteinuria was previously observed in 3%-36% renal transplant recipients, nephrotic syndrome was not reported in cancer patients taking everolimus. However, nephrotic syndrome was reported in patients taking sirolimus.

She was on 10 mg everolimus once a day and 200 mg voriconazole twice a day orally. Renal biopsy revealed thrombotic microangiopathic vasculopathy and thin basement membrane nephropathy. Discontinuation of everolimus and voriconazole rapidly improved her nephrotic syndrome.

METHODS Adult patients with mRCC were eligible for everolimus treatment after first-line vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors or bevacizumab therapy. The primary end-point, QoL, was assessed by means of the NCCN-FACT FKSI-19 questionnaire. RESULTS In total, 202 patients (24% of female patients; median age, 71 years) were evaluable for QoL analyses. The median treatment duration was 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.8-5.3) and the median time to progression was 6 months (95% CI, 5.4-7.5). The median FKSI-19 total score remained stable during treatment (52.0 at therapy start, 55.0 at observation end). The median time effort spent on total therapy was 20 hours per patient. Most of the patients stated to have \"no limitations,\" \"a little\" or \"moderate\" limitations in their daily, social, and professional lives. Two months after the start of treatment, 65 patients reported none or a little time burden due to therapy. CONCLUSIONS QoL was maintained during the everolimus therapy and limitations as well as time effort were acceptable for most of the patients.

BACKGROUND Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ES/pPNET) is often difficult to distinguish from other small round cell tumors. The EWS-Ets gene fusions that result from chromosomal translocations in this tumor provide potential molecular diagnostic markers. To apply these molecular markers to commonly available archival materials, we evaluated the feasibility of detecting EWS-Ets including EWS-Fli1 and EWS-ERG fusion transcripts in paraffin-embedded tissues and its diagnostic value for detecting ES/pPNET. METHODS Thirteen paraffin-embedded samples of ES/pPNETs were retrieved from archives. Thirteen cases of other tumors with small round cell features (including rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, lymphoma, small cell carcinoma, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor) were used as negative controls. Beta-actin and beta2-microglobulin were used as internal controls. A nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assay was performed to detect the EWS-Fli1 and EWS-ERG fusion transcripts. RESULTS Beta-actin and beta2-microglobulin were detected in 10/13 and 13/13 ES/pPNETs, respectively. EWS-Fli1 fusion transcripts were detected in 11 of 13 (85%) ES/pPNETs. Three chimeric transcripts, all EWS-Fli1, were detected in ES/pPNET samples. Among 11 EWS-Fli1-positive cases, 7 cases had a type I fusion transcript involving fusion of EWS exon 7 with Fli1 exon 6, 2 cases had a type II fusion transcript involving EWS exon 7 with Fli1 exon 5, and 2 cases expressed fusion transcripts involving EWS exon 7 and Fli1 exon 8. Type I EWS-Fli1 fusion predominated over other types. Fusion types could not be distinguished in the remaining 2 cases. Thirteen negative controls did not show detectable chimeric messages. There was a significant relationship between EWS-Fli1 fusion transcripts and CD99 expression. CONCLUSIONS Molecular detection of EWS-Fli1 fusion transcripts in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material by nested RT-PCR is feasible and is useful for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of ES/pPNETs."

PURPOSE More than 90% of Ewing's sarcomas (ES) contain a fusion of the EWS and FLI1 genes, due to the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation. At the molecular level, the EWS-FLI1 rearrangements show great diversity. Specifically, many different combinations of exons from EWS and FLI1 encode in-frame fusion transcripts and result in differences in the length and composition of the chimeric protein, which functions as an oncogenic aberrant transcription factor. In the most common fusion type (type 1), EWS exon 7 is linked in frame with exon 6 of FLI1. As the fundamental pathogenetic lesion in ES, the molecular heterogeneity of these fusion transcripts may have functional and clinical significance. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a clinical and pathologic analysis of 112 patients with ES in which EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts were identified by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Adequate treatment and follow-up data were available in 99 patients treated with curative intent. Median follow-up in these 99 patients was 26 months (range, 1 to 140 months). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed that included other prognostic factors, such as age, tumor location, size, and stage. RESULTS Among the 99 patients suitable for survival analysis, the tumors in 64 patients contained the type 1 fusion and in 35 patients contained less common fusion types. Stage at presentation was localized in 74 patients and metastatic in 25. Metastases (relative risk [RR] = 2.6; P = .008), and type 1 EWS-FLI1 fusion (RR = 0.37; P = .014) were, respectively, independent negative and positive prognostic factors for overall survival by multivariate analysis. Among 74 patients with localized tumors, the type 1 EWS-FLI1 fusion was also a significant positive predictor of overall survival (RR = 0.32; P = .034) by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION EWS-FLI1 fusion type appears to be prognostically relevant in ES, independent of tumor site, stage, and size. Further studies are needed to clarify the biologic basis of this phenomenon."

Periosteal ESFT is extremely rare and only a small numbers of cases, including cases not confirmed by molecular detection of chimeric fusion gene, have been reported. We describe herein a case of periosteal ESFT of the femur in a 13-year-old boy harboring EWS-FLI1 chimeric fusion gene transcripts detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis.

Ewing sarcoma cells depend on the EWS-FLI1 fusion transcription factor for cell survival. Using an assay of EWS-FLI1 activity and genome-wide RNAi screening, we have identified proteins required for the processing of the EWS-FLI1 pre-mRNA. We show that Ewing sarcoma cells harboring a genomic breakpoint that retains exon 8 of EWSR1 require the RNA-binding protein HNRNPH1 to express in-frame EWS-FLI1. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts to the loss of function of the U2 snRNP component, SF3B1. Disrupted splicing of the EWS-FLI1 transcript alters EWS-FLI1 protein expression and EWS-FLI1-driven expression.

BACKGROUND Chromosomal translocations t(11;22) (q24;q12) are characteristic of about 80-90 % of Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors [bone and soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumors (PNET)]. They generate ews/fli1 rearrangements showing great diversity in breakpoint exon combination. In about 5 % of Ewing's tumors, ews is fused to the erg gene at 21q22. The various chimeric proteins encoded may function as aberrant oncogenic transcription factors. These specific translocations can be used for exact molecular diagnosis in these poorly differentiated small round-cell tumors. Moreover, the prognostic relevance of different translocational variants has been previously suggested. Furthermore, the sensitive molecular detection of minimal metastatic and residual disease and its clinical significance can be evaluated. To address these questions more definitively in the large number of patients registered in multicenter studies, it is often necessary to access archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissue if no fresh or frozen tumor material is available for analysis by RT (reverse transcription)-PCR. Specific problems arise from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue due to the degradation of RNA and insufficient extraction efficiency. Therefore, primer distance and product size are limited for successful PCR amplification. This conflicts with the requirement for identification of various possible exon combinations by PCR simultaneously using one single primer pair with larger distance. PATIENTS We examined paraffin embedded soft part tumor tissue samples from 47 Ewing's tumor patients. Patients were treated according to either CWS (Cooperative Weichteilsarkomstudie, CWS-91 or CWS-96) or Euro-E.W.I.N.G. 99 therapy protocols. METHOD We established a novel RT-PCR method, using 3 different exon specific sets of PCR primer pairs, selected according to the coding ews and fli1 nucleotide sequences (NCBI database), suitable for RT-PCR identification of variant ews/fli1 fusion transcripts in RNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. For use in combination with ews -primer, an erg specific primer was selected to alternatively test for ews/erg fusion transcripts. As positive control for the integrity of isolated mRNA, we used the ubiquitously expressed gapdh transcript for RT-PCR amplification in each sample. RESULTS In 31 cases (= 66 %) of 47 paraffin samples of Ewing's tumors analysed, gapdh control indicated adequate quality of RNA. In 16 cases no gapdh control fragment was amplifiable, nevertheless in 2 of these 16 samples distinct ews fusion products could be detected. In 23 cases we identified ews fusion transcripts. Thereof in 65 % ews exon 7 being fused to fli1 exon 6 (fusion type I), in 22 % to fli1 exon 5 (fusion type II). In 4 % each ews exon 10 being juxtaposed to fli1 either exon 6 or exon 5, respectively. An ews/erg fusion was detected in 4 % ( ews exon 7 fused to erg exon 6). In 10 samples, a gapdh fragment was amplified, but no ews/fli1 or - erg fusion transcript could be identified. The reference pathological review (I. L., Kiel, Germany) disproved the primary histopathology in 5 cases. CONCLUSIONS Using our different sets of exon specific primer pairs, it was possible to detect 4 different breakpoints of ews/fli1 fusion transcripts and the ews/erg fusion by RT-PCR in RNA isolates from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded Ewing's tumor tissue. This method can be a very useful alternative in clinical situations (to ensure diagnosis and perform minimal metastatic and residual disease investigations) and in order to assess prognostic significance of translocation subtypes when no fresh tumor tissue is available."

PURPOSE Because of the high heterogeneity of EWS gene fusions with FLI1 and ERG genes due to variable chromosomal breakpoint locations in Ewing tumors (ET) (14 different chimeric transcripts identified so far), we evaluated the clinical impact of the expression of diverse fusion transcripts in ET patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS In a European multicenter study, 147 ET were analyzed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the molecular data statistically compared with all clinical data available. RESULTS Most tumors expressed chimeric transcripts with fusion of EWS exon 7 to FLI1 exon 6 (75 of 147) (type I) or five (39 of 147) and EWS exon 10 to FLI1 exon 5 (eight of 147) or 6 (five of 147). In five cases, chimerism between EWS exon 9 and FLI1 exons 4 and EWS exon 7 and FLI1 exon 7 or 8 was observed. Fifteen cases of EWS-ERG rearrangement were identified. In 85 of these patients treated in the European Cooperative Ewing Sarcoma Studies, molecular results were analyzed in comparison to age, sex, tumor localization, tumor volume, and disease extension. No significant correlation between the various fusion types and these features were observed. Relapse-free survival (RFS) for the 31 patients with localized disease and fusion type I tended to be longer compared with the 24 patients with localized tumors bearing other chimeric transcripts (P = .04).

The Ewing family of tumors (EFT) is characterized by high MIC2/CD99 expression and specific EWS/ETS gene rearrangements, resulting in different chimeric transcripts. Further division into peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors and Ewing's sarcoma is still debated and, in the absence of distinct morphological parameters, has been based on the reactivity with neuroglial markers (NgM). We investigated 44 EFT in terms of a possible correlation between the type of EWS chimeric transcripts and reactivity with the following NgM: polyclonal and monoclonal neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S-100, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, Leu-7, glial fibrillary acid protein, and neurofilament. EWS/Fli1 fusion type 1 was detected in 30 of 44 and type 2 in 11 of 44 tumors. Three tumors, presenting with an uncommon morphology, carried rare chimeric transcripts. Our results indicate an association of lack of NgM staining with type 1 EWS/Fli1 translocations, found in 16 of 18 tumors with no NgM expression as detectable by any of the antibodies we applied. Using the monoclonal NSE antibody, 21 of 26 tumors without NgM staining expressed type 1 EWS/FLI1chimeric RNA, whereas in the groups with 1 or more and 2 or more NgM, only 9 of 17 and 1 of 5 tumors, respectively, carried type 1 EWS/Fli1 fusion transcripts. Despite this association of increased NgM expression with a non-type 1 EWS/Fli1 gene fusion, a strict correlation between the extent of NgM expression and certain EWS fusion types was not evident. This fortifies the concept to consider EFT as a spectrum of tumors and suggests the type of EWS fusion transcripts as one, but not the only parameter influencing the extent of differentiation."

Recently, however, it was reported that by using highly sensitive nested RT-PCR, a high proportion of GCT displays chimeric EWS/FLI1 fusion transcripts, i.e., the molecular genetic feature previously known to be strongly associated with the Ewing family of tumors. Thus, we decided to perform single-step and nested RT-PCR analyses on fresh frozen samples from 10 cases of GCT, all of which had also been subjected to cytogenetic analysis.

RESULTS Using a Hox protein partnership as a test case, we investigated the suitability of BiFC for the study of protein interactions in the living Drosophila embryo. Importantly, all BiFC parameters were established with constructs that were stably expressed under the control of endogenous promoters. Under these physiological conditions, we showed that BiFC is specific and sensitive enough to analyse dynamic protein interactions. We next used BiFC in a candidate interaction screen, which led to the identification of several Hox protein partners.

Two proteins tagged with the different half-fragments emit a fluorescent signal when they are in physical contact, thus revealing a protein interaction and its spatial distribution. Because myofibrils are large networks of interconnected proteins, BIFC is an ideal method to study protein-protein interactions in myofibrils.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 60 subjects divided into two groups: active athletes and people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. RESULTS Mean values of IVSd recorded in GB is IVSd=17.5 mm (n=20, 95% CI, 16.00-19.00 mm), while a significantly smaller mean value is recorded in GA, IVSd=10.0 mm (n=40, 95% CI, 9.00-11.00 mm). The mean value of the left ventricle in diastole (LVDd) recorded in the GA is LVDd=51 mm (n=40; 95% CI, 48.00 to 52.00 mm), while in the group with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (GB) mean LVDd value is 42 mm (n=20; 95% CI, 40.00 to 48.00 mm). The mean value of the rear wall of the left ventricle (LVPWd) recorded in the GA is LVDd=10 mm (n=40; 95% CI, 9.00-10.00 mm) while in the group with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (GB) mean LVDd is 14 mm (n=20; 95% CI, 12.00 to 16.00 mm). The mean of the left ventricle during systole (LVSD) observed in GA is LVSD=34 mm (n=40; 95% CI, 32.00 to 36.00 mm), while in the group with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (GB) mean LVSD is 28 mm (n=20; 95% CI, 24.00 to 28.83 mm). The mean ejection fraction (EF%) observed in GA is EF=60% (n=40; 95% CI, 56.41 to 63.00%), while in the group with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (GB) mean EF value is 69% (n=20; 95% CI, 62.00 to 70.83 mm). Somewhat higher mean diastolic left ventricular function (E/A) was observed in GA, E/A=1.76\u00b10.15, and lower average values in the group with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: (GB) E/A=0.78\u00b10.02. CONCLUSION Mean values of parameters intraventricular septum thickness in diastole (IVSd), the thickness of the rear wall of the left ventricle (LVPWd), the diameter of the left ventricle during systole (LVSD) were statistically different between groups of athletes (GA) compared to the group of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (GB)."

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most-common monogenically inherited form of heart disease, characterized by thickening of the left ventricular wall, contractile dysfunction, and potentially fatal arrhythmias. HCM is also the most-common cause of sudden cardiac death in individuals younger than 35 years of age. Much progress has been made in the elucidation of the genetic basis of HCM, resulting in the identification of more than 900 individual mutations in over 20 genes. Interestingly, most of these genes encode sarcomeric proteins, such as myosin-7 (also known as cardiac muscle \u03b2-myosin heavy chain; MYH7), cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), and cardiac muscle troponin T (TNNT2). However, the molecular events that ultimately lead to the clinical phenotype of HCM are still unclear. We discuss several potential pathways, which include altered calcium cycling and sarcomeric calcium sensitivity, increased fibrosis, disturbed biomechanical stress sensing, and impaired cardiac energy homeostasis. An improved understanding of the pathological mechanisms involved will result in greater specificity and success of therapies for patients with HCM."

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a hereditary disease characterized by cardiac hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction. Gene mutations causing HCM have been found in about half of HCM patients, while the genetic etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown for many cases of HCM. To identify novel mechanisms underlying HCM pathogenesis, we generated a cardiovascular-mutant medaka fish, non-spring heart (nsh), which showed diastolic dysfunction and hypertrophic myocardium. The nsh homozygotes had fewer myofibrils, disrupted sarcomeres and expressed pathologically stiffer titin isoforms. In addition, the nsh heterozygotes showed M-line disassembly that is similar to the pathological changes found in HCM. Positional cloning revealed a missense mutation in an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain located in the M-line-A-band transition zone of titin. Screening of mutations in 96 unrelated patients with familial HCM, who had no previously implicated mutations in known sarcomeric gene candidates, identified two mutations in Ig domains close to the M-line region of titin. In vitro studies revealed that the mutations found both in medaka fish and in familial HCM increased binding of titin to muscle-specific ring finger protein 1 (MURF1) and enhanced titin degradation by ubiquitination. These findings implicate an impaired interaction between titin and MURF1 as a novel mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HCM."

BACKGROUND Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common cause of sudden death in athletes and differentiating this condition from the nonpathological \"athlete's heart\" remains a challenge. The development of pathological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is associated with left atrial (LA) dilatation and dysfunction. LA strain and strain rate by two-dimensional (2D) speckle tracking are novel indices of LA function and might contribute to differentiate physiological from pathological LVH among athletes with underdiagnosed HCM. METHODS We evaluated 20 patients with nonobstructive HCM, 20 highly trained athletes and 20 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and body surface area. All patients underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram with evaluation of LA strain: s-wave (LASs); and strain rate: s-wave (LASRs) and a-wave (LASRa). RESULTS LV mass index, LA volume index, and ejection fraction were comparable between patients with HCM and athletes. Patients with HCM had a significantly lower LASs (19 + 8% vs. 43 + 8%, P < 0.01), LASRs (0.7 + 0.2 s-1 vs. 1.6 + 0.2 s-1, P < 0.01), and LASRa (-0.8 + 0.1 s-1 vs. -1.4 + 0.3 s-1, P < 0.01) compared to athletes. Among hypertrophic subjects, independent predictors of hypertrophy related to HCM were LASs and E/\u00e9 ratio. CONCLUSIONS LA myocardial deformation is significantly impaired in patients with HCM compared to athletes and healthy controls. LA strain and strain rate assessed by 2D speckle tracking should be incorporated in the evaluation of trained athletes with LVH and LA dilatation."

Regarding classification, entities that may be confounded with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been identified (eg, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, mantle-cell lymphoma in leukemic phase); these diseases should be known and clearly separated from chronic lymphocytic leukemia because their prognosis and treatment is different from that of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. On the other hand, the molecular basis of some of these diseases (eg, the overexpression of the Prad1/CCND1 gene in mantle-cell lymphomas, the relationship between bcl-2 and bax expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia homeostasis, the role of p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia progression) are increasingly well known. Cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha or IL-2, IL-4, and IL-13) also contribute to the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative disorders by either promoting cell growth or inhibiting apoptosis. In addition, new treatment possibilities (eg, purine analogues, hemopoietic progenitors transplants) are changing the treatment objectives in some of these diseases. Thus, symptoms' palliation is no longer the only realistic aim in the management of patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, but sustained complete remissions and even cures can be achieved."

The prognosis of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia is very difficult to evaluate. The classification system by stages, which at the present time is the most simple and useful method for the prognosis of this disease, recognizes five degrees of involvement: stage 0 (medullary and peripheral lymphocytosis); stage I (lymphocytosis + enlarged lymph nodes); stage II (lymphocyosis + hepato-and/or splenomegaly); stage III (lymphocytosis + anemia), and stage IV (lymphocytosis + thrombocytopenia). In the present report 95 controlled patients at the Farreras Valent\u00ed School of Hematology are analyzed using the classification by stages; there were 19 cases in stage 0; 16 in stage I; 30 in stage II; 21 in stage III, and 9 in stage IV. The mean survival rate in the global series was 63 months and the average 90.9 months. As in other series, it was observed that patients in stages 0 and I have a much better prognosis than those in stages III and IV. Stage II occupies an intermediate position in relation to prognosis, since the actuarial survival figure for this stage can practically be superimposed on that of the global series. The classification of chronic lymphocytic leukemia by stages permits the specification of the therapeutic indications for this condition; it also encourages the search for new modalities of treatment for stages with poor prognosis, since in these cases chronic lymphocytic leukemia behaves in the manner of an acute or subacute hemopathy."

In this work, we attempt to provide computer-assisted support to the clinical experts of the field, by deploying a classification system for B-CLL multiparametric prognosis that combines various heterogeneous (clinical, laboratory and flow cytometry) parameters associated with the disease. For this purpose, we employ the na\u00efve-Bayes classifier and propose an algorithm that improves its performance. The algorithm discretizes the continuous classification attributes (candidate prognostic parameters) and selects the most useful subset of them to optimize the classification accuracy.

In this paper, we aimed to identify the major sub-types of malignant lymphoma in our area and compare the distribution with other published studies. METHODS During a retrospective study we evaluate 391 adult patients with lymphoid malignancy from \"Omid Hospital\" - a cancer research center and an outpatient hematologic clinic in Mashhad - were evaluated from 2000 to 2009. Patients were reclassified using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. RESULTS The frequency of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) was 92% (n=359) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) was 8% (n=32). The most frequent NHL sub-type using WHO classification was diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and the second most common NHL was chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). The most common sub-type of HL was mixed cellularity. In this study the frequency of primary extranodal NHL in our study was 11.5%, which slightly less common than other eastern countries.

Complete loss of function of this gene is not compatible with life. On the other hand, missense and copy number variants of CHD1 can result in intellectual disabilities and craniofacial malformations in human patients including cleft palate and Pilarowski-Bjornsson Syndrome. We have used the aquatic developmental model organism Xenopus laevis, to determine a specific role for Chd1 in such cranioafcial disorders. Protein and gene knockdown techniques in Xenopus, including antisense oligos and mosaic Crispr/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis, recapitulated the craniofacial defects observed in humans. Further analysis indicated that embryos deficient in Chd1 had defects in cranial neural crest development and jaw cartilage morphology. Additionally, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry revealed that decreased Chd1 resulted in increased in apoptosis in the developing head. Together, these experiments demonstrate that Chd1 is critical for fundamental processes and cell survival in craniofacial development. We also presented evidence that Chd1 is regulated by retinoic acid signaling during craniofacial development. Expression levels of chd1 mRNA, specifically in the head, were increased by RAR agonist exposure and decreased upon antagonist treatment. Subphenotypic levels of an RAR antagonist and Chd1 morpholinos synergized to result in orofacial defects. Further, RAR DNA binding sequences (RAREs) were detected in chd1 regulatory regions by bioinformatic analysis. In summary, by combining human genetics and experiments in an aquatic model we now have a better understanding of the role of CHD1 in craniofacial disorders."

The molecular motor protein CHD1 has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and in the transcription-independent genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 into paternal chromatin in Drosophila melanogaster. A key feature of CHD1 is the presence of two chromodomains, which can bind to histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 and thus might serve to recruit and/or maintain CHD1 at the chromatin. Here, we describe genetic and biochemical approaches to the study of the Drosophila CHD1 chromodomains. We found that overall localization of CHD1 on polytene chromosomes does not appreciably change in chromodomain-mutant flies. In contrast, the chromodomains are important for transcription-independent activities of CHD1 during early embryonic development as well as for transcriptional regulation of several heat shock genes. However, neither CHD1 nor its chromodomains are needed for RNA polymerase II localization and H3K4 methylation but loss of CHD1 decreases transcription-induced histone eviction at the Hsp70 gene in vivo. Chromodomain mutations negatively affect the chromatin assembly activities of CHD1 in vitro, and they appear to be involved in linking the ATP-dependent motor to the chromatin assembly function of CHD1."

Mouse CHD1 is required for the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency while human CHD1 may function as a tumor suppressor. To investigate the action of CHD1 on higher order chromatin structure in differentiated cells, we examined the consequences of loss of CHD1 and over-expression of CHD1 on polytene chromosomes from salivary glands of third instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae. We observed that chromosome structure is sensitive to the amount of this remodeler. Loss of CHD1 resulted in alterations of chromosome structure and an increase in the heterochromatin protein HP1a, while over-expression of CHD1 disrupted higher order chromatin structure and caused a decrease in levels of HP1a. Over-expression of an ATPase inactive form of CHD1 did not result in severe chromosomal defects, suggesting that the ATPase activity is required for this in vivo phenotype. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II. Thus, while CHD1 is localized to transcriptionally active regions of the genome, it can function to alter the levels of HP1a, perhaps through changes in methylation of H3K9."

The primitive state (stemness) of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is responsible for supporting the function of tissue-specific stem cells to regenerate damaged tissues. However, molecular mechanisms regulating the stemness of MSCs remain unknown. In this study, we found that the primitive state of MSCs is hierarchically regulated by the expression levels of the chromatin remodeling complex, CHD1, with CHD1 expression levels higher in the undifferentiated state, and decreasing upon MSC differentiation. Consistently, CHD1 expression levels decrease during progressive loss of clonogenic progenitors (CFU-F) induced by passage cultures. Moreover, knockdown (KD) of CHD1 decreased CFU-F frequency, whereas CHD1 overexpression increased it. In addition, the expression of stem cell-specific genes was down- or upregulated upon KD or overexpression of CHD1, respectively, accompanied by associated changes in chromatin condensation. Importantly, altering CHD1 expression levels affected the ability of MSCs to support the self-renewing expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Furthermore, CHD1 levels were significantly decreased in MSCs from acute myeloid leukemia or aplastic anemia patients, where CFU-F and HSC-supporting activities are lost. Altogether, these findings show that chromatin remodeling by CHD1 is a molecular parameter that influences the primitive state of MSCs and their stem cell-supporting activity, which controls tissue regeneration."

Epigenetic mechanisms that modulate the chromatin structure have emerged as important regulators in this context. While posttranslational modification of histones or the modification of DNA bases have been examined in detail in many studies, the role of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors (ChRFs) in learning- and memory-associated gene regulation has largely remained obscure. Here we present data that implicate the highly conserved chromatin assembly and remodeling factor Chd1 in memory formation and the control of immediate early gene (IEG) response in the hippocampus. We used various paradigms to assess short-and long-term memory in mice bearing a mutated Chd1 gene that gives rise to an N-terminally truncated protein. Our data demonstrate that the Chd1 mutation negatively affects long-term object recognition and short- and long-term spatial memory. We found that Chd1 regulates hippocampal expression of the IEG early growth response 1 (Egr1) and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) but not cFos and brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), because the Chd1-mutation led to dysregulation of Egr1 and Arc expression in naive mice and in mice analyzed at different stages of object location memory (OLM) testing. Of note, Chd1 likely regulates Egr1 in a direct manner, because chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed enrichment of Chd1 upon stimulation at the Egr1 genomic locus in the hippocampus and in cultured cells. Together these data support a role for Chd1 as a critical regulator of molecular mechanisms governing memory-related processes, and they show that this function involves the N-terminal serine-rich region of the protein."

Here we show that CHD1 exists predominantly as a monomer and functions as an ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly factor. This reaction involves purified CHD1, NAP1 chaperone, core histones and relaxed DNA. CHD1 catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of histones from the NAP1 chaperone to the DNA by a processive mechanism that yields regularly spaced nucleosomes. The comparative analysis of CHD1 and ACF revealed that CHD1 assembles chromatin with a shorter nucleosome repeat length than ACF. In addition, ACF, but not CHD1, can assemble chromatin containing histone H1, which is involved in the formation of higher-order chromatin structure and transcriptional repression. These results suggest a role for CHD1 in the assembly of active chromatin and a function of ACF in the assembly of repressive chromatin."

Deletion of CHD1 suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect caused by mutations in either SPT16 or POB3, which encode subunits of the yFACT chromatin-reorganizing complex. chd1 also suppresses synthetic defects caused by combining an spt16 mutation with other transcription factor mutations, including the synthetic lethality caused by combining an spt16 mutation with TATA binding protein (TBP) or TFIIA defects. Binding of TBP and RNA polymerase II to the GAL1 promoter is reduced in a pob3 mutant, resulting in low levels of GAL1 expression, and all three defects are suppressed by removing Chd1. These results suggest that Chd1 and yFACT have opposing roles in regulating TBP binding at promoters. Additionally, overexpression of Chd1 is tolerated in wild-type cells but is toxic in spt16 mutants. Further, both the ATPase and chromodomain are required for Chd1 activity in opposing yFACT function. Similar to the suppression by chd1, mutations in the SET2 histone methyltransferase also suppress defects caused by yFACT mutations. chd1 and set2 are additive in suppressing pob3, suggesting that Chd1 and Set2 act in distinct pathways.

It is required for pre-mRNA maturation, maintenance of mouse embryonic stem cell pluripotency and rapid growth of the mouse epiblast. However, the function(s) of CHD1 in mouse preimplantation embryos has not yet been examined. Here, we show that loss of CHD1 function led to embryonic lethality after implantation. In mouse embryos in which Chd1 was targeted by siRNA microinjection, the expression of the key regulators of cell fate specification Pou5f1 (also known as Oct4), Nanog and Cdx2 was dramatically decreased, starting at mid-preimplantation gene activation (MGA). Moreover, expression of Hmgpi and Klf5, which regulate Pou5f1, Nanog and Cdx2, was also significantly suppressed at zygotic gene activation (ZGA). Suppression of Hmgpi expression in Chd1-knockdown embryos continued until the blastocyst stage, whereas suppression of Klf5 expression was relieved by the morula stage. Next, we rescued HMGPI expression via Hmgpi mRNA microinjection in Chd1-knockdown embryos. Consequently, Pou5f1, Nanog and Cdx2 expression was restored at MGA and live offspring were recovered. These findings indicate that CHD1 plays important roles in mouse early embryogenesis via activation of Hmgpi at ZGA."

CHD1 functions within the network of partially redundant factors: mutations in individual chromatin assembly factors are viable, but combination of Chd1 mutations with mutations of other ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factors (acf1, dRsf1, tou) causes synthetic lethality.

To understand better the cellular function of CHD proteins, we initiated a study on the Chd1p protein from budding yeast. Using genomic DNA arrays, we identified genes whose expression is affected by the absence of Chd1p. A synthetic-lethal screen uncovered genetic interactions between SWI/SNF genes and CHD1. Biochemical experiments using Chd1p purified from yeast showed that it reconfigures the structure of nucleosome core particles in a manner distinct from the SWI-SNF complex. Taken together, these results suggest that Chd1p functions as a nucleosome remodeling factor, and that Chd1p may share overlapping roles with the SWI-SNF complex to regulate transcription."

Here we describe two new dual specificity phosphatases of the CL100/MKP-1 family that are selective for inactivating ERK or JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases when expressed in COS-7 cells. M3/6 is the first phosphatase of this family to display highly specific inactivation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases. Although stress-induced activation of p54 SAPKbeta, p46 SAPKgamma (JNK1) or p38 MAP kinases is abolished upon co-transfection with increasing amounts of M3/6 plasmid, epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK1 is remarkably insensitive even to the highest levels of M3/6 expression obtained. In contrast to M3/6, the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-3 is selective for inactivation of ERK family MAP kinases. Low level expression of MKP-3 blocks totally epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK1, whereas stress-induced activation of p54 SAPKbeta and p38 MAP kinases is inhibited only partially under identical conditions. Selective regulation by M3/6 and MKP-3 was also observed upon chronic MAP kinase activation by constitutive p21(ras) GTPases. Hence, although M3/6 expression effectively blocked p54 SAPKbeta activation by p21(rac) (G12V), ERK1 activated by p21(ras) (G12V) was insensitive to this phosphatase. ERK1 activation by oncogenic p21(ras) was, however, blocked totally by co-expression of MKP-3.

M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK. It has been shown that M3/6 itself is phosphorylated by JNK upon stimulation with arsenite, but the role of this phosphorylation has not been investigated. In this study, we mapped JNK-induced phosphorylation sites on M3/6 using mass spectrometry. Phosphorylated residues Ser 515, Thr 518 and Ser 520 were identified and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to investigate their role. Upon arsenite stimulation, M3/6 mutated at these sites exhibited decreased phosphorylation compared to the wild-type protein. No difference was observed in terms of the enzyme's in vitro phosphatase activity, its substrate specificity towards JNK isoforms, its interactions with JNK and the scaffold family of JNK-interacting proteins (JIPs), its stability or its subcellular localization. Interestingly, expression of M3/6 phosphorylation mutants delayed the time-course of JNK phosphorylation and activation by arsenite. We propose that phosphorylation of the M3/6 phosphatase by JNK in response to stress stimuli results in attenuation of phosphatase activity and acceleration of JNK activation."

The results revealed upregulation of dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) activity at 4 h of reperfusion in rat hippocampi. This was accompanied by the dephosphorylation of JNK. The M3/6 inhibitor, anisomycin, was found to enhance JNK activity following postischemic reperfusion, suggesting that M3/6 is closely associated with JNK inactivation following cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia also induced an increase in heat shock protein (HSP70) levels, which is involved in the upregulation of soluble cytoplasmic M3/6 levels. The inhibition of HSP70 using quercetin resulted in an elevation of JNK activity by decreasing the cytoplasmic solubility of M3/6.

PMA treatment rapidly induced hVH5 transcripts in these cells, and induced expression of M3/6 completely inhibited PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of SAPK, suggesting a feedback loop to control SAPK activity. Using both stable cell lines and transient transfection we demonstrate that activation of SAPK rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of M3/6. This phosphorylation did not regulate the half-life of total cellular M3/6. hVH5 and M3/6 shares with all sequenced mammalian DSPs an amino acid motif, XILPXLXL, located approximately 80 amino acids from the active site. The hVH5-M3/6 sequence, RILPHLYL, shares significant homology with the SAPK binding site of the c-Jun protein, called the delta domain.

Phosphatases play a particularly important role in this respect, by tightly controlling MAPK phosphorylation and activation.

We have investigated the interaction of M3/6 with JNK isoforms, as well as scaffold proteins of the JNK interacting protein (JIP) family, in order to elucidate the contribution of M3/6 to the regulation of distinct JNK signaling modules. M3/6 exhibited stronger binding towards JNK1\u03b2 and JNK2\u03b1 isoforms and this was reflected in higher enzymatic activity towards JNK2\u03b12 when compared to JNK1\u03b11 in vitro.

Chromosomal localization by analysis of DNAs from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and a panel of radiation hybrids assign the human gene for MKP-4 to Xq28.

Host cells must synthesize an array of biomolecules and engage in intracellular trafficking processes to enable viruses to complete their replication cycle. The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle has a key role in ATP production as well as in the synthesis of the biomolecules needed for viral replication. The final assembly and budding process of enveloped viruses, for instance, require lipids, and the TCA cycle provides the precursor (citrate) for fatty acid synthesis (FAS). Viral infections may induce host inflammation and TCA cycle metabolic intermediates participate in this process, notably citrate and succinate. On the other hand, viral infections may promote the synthesis of itaconate from TCA cis-aconitate. Itaconate harbors anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-microbial properties. Fumarate is another TCA cycle intermediate with immunoregulatory properties, and its derivatives such as dimethyl fumarate (DMF) are therapeutic candidates for the contention of virus-induced hyper-inflammation and oxidative stress. The TCA cycle is at the core of viral infection and replication as well as viral pathogenesis and anti-viral immunity.

Induction of the TCA cycle activity during NASH was concurrent with blunted ketogenesis and accumulation of hepatic diacylglycerols (DAGs), ceramides (Cer), and long-chain acylcarnitines, suggesting inefficient oxidation and disposal of excess free fatty acids (FFA). Sustained induction of mitochondrial TCA cycle failed to prevent accretion of \"lipotoxic\" metabolites in the liver and could hasten inflammation and the metabolic transition to NASH."

Chronic inflammation is an important risk factor in a broad variety of physical and mental disorders leading to highly prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, there is a need for a deeper understanding of this condition and its progression to the disease state. For this reason, it is important to define metabolic pathways and complementary biomarkers associated with homeostatic disruption in chronic inflammation. To achieve that, male Wistar rats were subjected to intraperitoneal and intermittent injections with saline solution or increasing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations (0.5, 5 and 7.5 mg/kg) thrice a week for 31 days. Biochemical and inflammatory parameters were measured at the end of the study. To assess the omics profile, GC-qTOF and UHPLC-qTOF were performed to evaluate plasma metabolome; 1H-NMR was used to evaluate urine metabolome; additionally, shotgun metagenomics sequencing was carried out to characterize the cecum microbiome. The chronicity of inflammation in the study was evaluated by the monitoring of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) during the different weeks of the experimental process. At the end of the study, together with the increased levels of MCP-1, levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) along with 8-isoprostanes (an indicative of oxidative stress) were significantly increased (p-value < 0.05). The leading features implicated in the current model were tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (i.e., alpha-ketoglutarate, aconitic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid); lipids such as specific cholesterol esters (ChoEs), lysophospholipids (LPCs) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs); and glycine, as well as N, N-dimethylglycine, which are related to one-carbon (1C) metabolism. These metabolites point towards mitochondrial metabolism through TCA cycle, \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids and 1C metabolism as interconnected pathways that could reveal the metabolic effects of chronic inflammation induced by LPS administration. These results provide deeper knowledge concerning the impact of chronic inflammation on the disruption of metabolic homeostasis."

UNLABELLED A recent controversial hypothesis suggested that the bactericidal action of antibiotics is due to the generation of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS), a process requiring the citric acid cycle (tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle). To test this hypothesis, we assessed the ability of oxacillin to induce ROS production and cell death in Staphylococcus epidermidis strain 1457 and an isogenic citric acid cycle mutant. Our results confirm a contributory role for TCA-dependent ROS in enhancing susceptibility of S. epidermidis toward \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and also revealed a propensity for clinical isolates to accumulate TCA cycle dysfunctions presumably as a way to tolerate these antibiotics. The increased protection from \u03b2-lactam antibiotics could result from pleiotropic effects of a dysfunctional TCA cycle, including increased resistance to oxidative stress, reduced susceptibility to autolysis, and a more positively charged cell surface. IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus epidermidis, a normal inhabitant of the human skin microflora, is the most common cause of indwelling medical device infections. In the present study, we analyzed 126 clinical S. epidermidis isolates and discovered that tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle dysfunctions are relatively common in the clinical environment. We determined that a dysfunctional TCA cycle enables S. epidermidis to resist oxidative stress and alter its cell surface properties, making it less susceptible to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics."

The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a housekeeping metabolic pathway essential for generation of energy and biosynthetic intermediates. Alterations of the TCA cycle play a pivotal role in oncogenesis and inflammation. As such, some metabolic vulnerabilities, imposed by TCA cycle dysfunction in cancer, have been identified. Similarly, the TCA cycle appeared as an actionable pathway in immunopathologies. Metabolic changes accompanying cell transformation have been usually considered as adaptive mechanisms to malignant transformation. The identification of oncogenic mutations in some TCA cycle enzymes changed this view, indicating altered mitochondrial metabolism as an instrumental mechanism for cancer initiation. Similarly, the observation that TCA cycle-derived metabolites have multiple signaling roles in immune cells supports the idea of this pathway as a metabolic rheostat of immune responses. This review summarizes the crucial role of the TCA cycle in pathophysiology describing the post-translational and epigenetic impact of oncometabolites accumulation in cancer and immune cells.

Nur77 deficient macrophages failed to downregulate IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) and accumulated succinic acid and other tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-derived metabolites in a glutamine-independent manner.

Here, we compared the energy-driving tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation cycle between 22 citrin-deficient children (age, 3-13years) with normal liver functions and 37 healthy controls (age, 5-13years).

However, this therapy did not correct or attenuate such deviations in both cycles. Sodium pyruvate therapy significantly increased fasting insulin secretion (p<0.01); the fasting sugar level remained unchanged.

BACKGROUND/AIM 3-bromopyruvate (3BrPA) is an antitumor agent able to inhibit aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, therefore inducing cell death. However, cancer cells are also highly dependent of glutaminolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) regarding survival and 3BrPA action in these metabolic routes is poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS The effect of 3BrPA was characterized in mice liver and kidney mitochondria, as well as in human HepG2 cells. RESULTS Low concentration of 3-BrPA significantly affected both glutaminolysis and TCA cycle functions, through inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase. Additionally, 3-BrPA treatment significantly decreased the reduced status of thiol groups in HepG2 cells without proportional increase of oxidizing groups, suggesting that these chemical groups are the target of alkylation reactions induced by 3-BrPA. CONCLUSION This work demonstrates, for the first time, the effect of 3-BrPA in glutaminolysis and TCA cycle. Our results suggest that the combined action of 3-BrPA in glutaminolysis, TCA and glycolysis, inhibiting steps downstream of the glucose and glutamine metabolism, has an antitumor effect."

In this review, we revisit the TCA cycle, including its potential origins and the history of its discovery. We provide a detailed accounting of the requirements for sustained TCA cycle function and the critical regulatory nodes that can stimulate or constrain TCA cycle activity. We also discuss recent advances in our understanding of the flexibility of TCA cycle wiring and the increasingly appreciated heterogeneity in TCA cycle activity exhibited by mammalian cells. Deeper insight into how the TCA cycle can be differentially regulated and, consequently, configured in different contexts will shed light on how this pathway is primed to meet the requirements of distinct mammalian cell states."

A method for assessing genomic similarity based on relative abundances of short oligonucleotides in large DNA samples is introduced. The method requires neither homologous sequences nor prior sequence alignments. The analysis centers on (i) dinucleotide (and tri- and tetra-) relative abundance extremes in genomic sequences, (ii) distances between sequences based on all dinucleotide relative abundance values, and (iii) a multidimensional partial ordering protocol. The emphasis in this paper is on assessments of general relatedness of genomes as distinguished from phylogenetic reconstructions. Our methods demonstrate that the relative abundance distances almost always differ more for genomic interspecific sequence comparisons than for genomic intraspecific sequence comparisons, indicating congruence over different genome sequence samples. The genomic comparisons are generally concordant with accepted phylogenies among vertebrate and among fungal species sequences. Several unexpected relationships between the major groups of metazoa, fungal, and protist DNA emerge, including the following. (i) Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in dinucleotide relative abundance distances are as similar to each other as human is to bovine. (ii) S. cerevisiae, although substantially far from, is significantly closer to the vertebrates than are the invertebrates (Drosophila melanogaster, Bombyx mori, and Caenorhabditis elegans). This phenomenon may suggest variable evolutionary rates during the metazoan radiations and slower changes in the fungal divergences, and/or a polyphyletic origin of metazoa. (iii) The genomic sequences of D. melanogaster and Trypanosoma brucei are strikingly similar. This DNA similarity might be explained by some molecular adaptation of the parasite to its dipteran (tsetse fly) host, a host-parasite gene transfer hypothesis. Robustness of the methods may be due to a genomic signature of dinucleotide relative abundance values reflecting DNA structures related to dinucleotide stacking energies, constraints of DNA curvature, and mechanisms attendant to replication, repair, and recombination."

Previous studies with respect to prokaryotes and this study document that profiles of different DNA sequence samples (sample size >/=50 kb) from the same organism are generally much more similar to each other than they are to profiles from other organisms, and that closely related organisms generally have more similar profiles than do distantly related organisms. On this basis we refer to the collection (rho*XY) as the genome signature. This paper identifies rho*XY extremes and compares genome signature differences for a diverse range of eukaryotic species. Interpretations on the mechanisms maintaining these profile differences center on genome-wide replication, repair, DNA structures, and context-dependent mutational biases. It is also observed that mitochondrial genome signature differences between species parallel the corresponding nuclear genome signature differences despite large differences between corresponding mitochondrial and nuclear signatures. The genome signature differences also have implications for contrasts between rodents and other mammals, and between monocot and dicot plants, as well as providing evidence for similarities among fungi and the diversity of protists."

Plasmids are ubiquitous mobile elements that serve as a pool of many host beneficial traits such as antibiotic resistance in bacterial communities.

Since extensive data support the proposal that foreign DNA acquires the host's nucleotide composition during long-term residence, comparison of nucleotide composition of plasmids and chromosomes could shed light on a plasmid's evolutionary history. The average absolute dinucleotide relative abundance difference, termed delta-distance, has been commonly used to measure differences in dinucleotide composition, or 'genomic signature', between bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. Here, we introduce the Mahalanobis distance, which takes into account the variance-covariance structure of the chromosome signatures. We demonstrate that the Mahalanobis distance is better than the delta-distance at measuring genomic signature differences between plasmids and chromosomes of potential hosts. We illustrate the usefulness of this metric for proposing candidate long-term hosts for plasmids, focusing on the virulence plasmids pXO1 from Bacillus anthracis, and pO157 from Escherichia coli O157:H7, as well as the broad host range multi-drug resistance plasmid pB10 from an unknown host."

Previously, the concept of a genomic signature was introduced with the observation of species-type specific Dinucleotide Relative Abundance Profiles (DRAPs); dinucleotides were identified as the subsequences with the greatest bias in representation in a majority of genomes. Herein, we demonstrate that DRAP is one particular genomic signature contained within a broader spectrum of signatures. Within this spectrum, an alternative genomic signature, Chaos Game Representation (CGR), provides a unique visualization of patterns in sequence organization. A genomic signature is associated with a particular integer order or subsequence length that represents a measure of the resolution or granularity in the analysis of primary DNA sequence organization. We quantitatively explore the organizational information provided by genomic signatures of different orders through different distance measures, including a novel Image Distance. The Image Distance and other existing distance measures are evaluated by comparing the phylogenetic trees they generate for 26 complete mitochondrial genomes from a diversity of species. The phylogenetic tree generated by the Image Distance is compatible with the known relatedness of species.

We analysed 1808 HIV-1 envelope gene sequences from three independent longitudinal studies; this included 1280 sequences from twelve typical-progressors and 528 sequences from six slow-progressors. Relative abundance of CpG dinucleotides and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) for CpG-containing codons among HIV-1 envelope gene sequences from typical-progressors and slow-progressors were analysed.

In this study, intrinsic dinucleotide genomic signatures were analyzed for whole genome sequence data of eight pathogenic species, including SARS-CoV-2. The genome sequences were transformed into dinucleotide relative frequencies and classified using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model. The classification models were trained to a) distinguish between the sequences of all eight species and b) distinguish between sequences of SARS-CoV-2 that originate from different geographic regions. Our method attained 100% in all performance metrics and for all tasks in the eight-species classification problem. Moreover, the models achieved 67% balanced accuracy for the task of classifying the SARS-CoV-2 sequences into the six continental regions and achieved 86% balanced accuracy for the task of classifying SARS-CoV-2 samples as either originating from Asia or not. Analysis of the dinucleotide genomic profiles of the eight species revealed a similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV viral sequences.

Therefore, these groups are considered different, and outcomes cannot be compared. Overall short-term procedural success was observed in 93.8%. The incidence of valve embolization was 0.3% (n=3), and coronary obstruction was reported for 0.6% (n=6 cases). Incidence of stroke was 2.5% and similar for both procedural approaches. Thirty-day mortality was 6.3% in transfemoral patients and 10.3% in transapical patients. The occurrence of vascular complications was not a predictor of <30-day mortality in the transfemoral population. CONCLUSIONS Technical proficiency can be learned and adapted readily as demonstrated by the short-term procedural success rate and low 30-day mortality rates reported in the SOURCE Registry. Specific complication management and refinement of patient selection are needed to further improve outcomes."

We validated and standardized the Syndrom Kurztest, a brief European neuropsychological test, in a population of elderly Chileans, possessing high levels of illiteracy. In our sample, the SKT was found to be an effective instrument for the diagnosis of dementias, and for differentiating mild-moderate from severe degrees of the disease.

OBJECTIVE Trans-catheter aortic valve implantation is an alternative treatment option for patients facing high risk for aortic valve replacement. Currently, the results of trans-apical trans-catheter procedures performed outside controlled trials are unknown. METHODS The Edwards SAPIEN Aortic Bioprosthesis European Outcome (SOURCE) Registry collects data of patients treated at European centres during the first year following commercialisation of the Edwards SAPIEN bioprosthesis. Only data from centres that could provide 100% of their consecutively treated patients (n=32) were included in the study population. This article provides the 30-day outcome data involving the trans-apical patients, including univariate and multivariate risk analyses for postoperative 30-day mortality. RESULTS The interim results are based on a total number of 575 procedures performed between January 2008 and 31 January 2009. Mean age at implant was 80.7 years, and patients had a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 29.1%. Baseline characteristics included coronary artery disease 56%, prior coronary intervention 27.1%, prior coronary bypass grafting 26.9%, concomitant mitral valve disease 32.8%, porcelain aorta 11.5%, peripheral vascular disease 27.5%, prior stroke 6.3% and pulmonary disease 29.4%. Successful valve deployment was observed in 92.7% with a 3.5% conversion rate to open surgery, incidence of coronary obstruction of 0.7% and valve embolisation of 0.5%. The incidence of aortic regurgitation in excess of 2+ was 2.3% immediately following the procedure. The incidence of major postoperative complications included bleeding requiring re-operation 2.1%, dialysis 7.1%, pacemaker implantation 7.3%, stroke 2.6%, major vascular complications 2.4% and myocardial infarction 0.7%. The total 30-day mortality was 10.3%. Logistic EuroSCORE > or =30% and missing ejection fraction were found to be the only independent predictors for 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that although trans-apical trans-catheter aortic valve implantation is a complex surgical technique, the learning curve can be minimised by appropriate training programmes. Very high logistic EuroSCOREs predict inferior survival and make it likely that in this subgroup of patients there may be some who, despite having had a successful trans-catheter aortic valve implantation procedure, do not benefit in the midterm."

Incidence is largely unknown because of incomplete, or lack of, registration in most countries. OBJECTIVES To assess current incidence rates and recent trends for BCC in the Swedish population. METHODS Patient- and tumour-related features of all histologically confirmed BCC tumours diagnosed in Sweden from 2004 to 2017 were extracted from the population-based Swedish BCC Registry. Incidence rates were standardized to the 2013 European Standard Population and trends were analysed using Poisson regression models. RESULTS The age-standardized person-based incidence rate of BCC in Sweden was 405 per 100 000 in 2017, rising from 308 per 100 000 in 2004, corresponding to an annual relative increase of 1\u00b78% (women, 2\u00b71%; men, 1\u00b74%). Incidence was highest in elderly people and the most common tumour site was the head and neck. In 2017, the most common BCC subtypes were nodular and micronodular/infiltrative BCC (each 31%). Incidence of aggressive BCC subtypes increased faster than other subtypes. CONCLUSIONS BCC incidence rates in Sweden are relatively high and increasing. The increasing trends were more pronounced in women and for aggressive BCC subtypes. What is already known about this topic? Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer in white populations and its incidence is increasing. BCC is seldom registered in national population-based cancer registries, therefore incidence estimates are extrapolated from small studies or incomplete registers. BCC occurs more often in men than in women and occurs most commonly on the head and neck, followed by the trunk. What does this study add? This study provides current BCC incidence rates for an entire European population. Sex-specific trends show that BCC incidence is increasing faster in women in Sweden. Aggressive BCC subtypes appear to be increasing faster than other subtypes."

Several microlevel studies have pinpointed prisons as an important site for tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant TB in European and central Asian countries. To date, no comparative analyses have examined whether rises in incarceration rates can account for puzzling differences in TB trends among overall populations. Using longitudinal TB and cross-sectional multidrug-resistant TB data for 26 eastern European and central Asian countries, we examined whether and to what degree increases in incarceration account for differences in population TB and multidrug-resistant TB burdens. We find that each percentage point increase in incarceration rates relates to an increased TB incidence of 0.34% (population attributable risk, 95% C.I.: 0.10-0.58%, P < 0.01), after controlling for TB infrastructure; HIV prevalence; and several surveillance, economic, demographic, and political indicators. Net increases in incarceration account for a 20.5% increase in TB incidence or nearly three-fifths of the average total increase in TB incidence in the countries studied from 1991 to 2002. Although the number of prisoners is a significant determinant of differences in TB incidence and multidrug-resistant TB prevalence among countries, the rate of prison growth is a larger determinant of these outcomes, and its effect is exacerbated but not confounded by HIV. Differences in incarceration rates are a major determinant of differences in population TB outcomes among eastern European and central Asian countries, and treatment expansion alone does not appear to resolve the effect of mass incarceration on TB incidence."

A total of 589 porcine bioprostheses were implanted in 509 patients from January, 1976, through December, 1983. Of the valves implanted, 390 were Hancock and 199 were Carpentier-Edwards. A total of 1,633 patient-years was accrued, with a mean follow-up of 38 months per patient. Two hundred eight patients had aortic valve replacement, 209 had mitral valve replacement, and 79 had multiple valve replacements, of which 46 were aortic and mitral replacements. The mortality for isolated aortic valve replacement was 5.8%; for isolated mitral replacement, 8.6%, and for all patients, 10.9%. Late mortality was 3.9% per patient-year. The actuarial survival rate at 5 years was 79% for aortic, 68% for mitral, and 76% for aortic-mitral valve replacement. There were 12 thromboembolic events (0.73% per patient-year). Two episodes occurred in patients with an aortic bioprosthesis, nine in patients with a porcine mitral valve, and one in a patient with mitral and tricuspid bioprosthetic valves. The probability of remaining free of thromboembolism at 5 years was 99% for the group having aortic valve replacement, 93% for those having mitral replacement, and 100% for the group having aortic-mitral valve replacements. Thirteen episodes of endocarditis occurred (0.8% per patient-year). Seven of the 13 patients died as a direct result of endocarditis. The probability of remaining free of prosthetic endocarditis at 5 years was 97% for the aortic valve replacement group, 95% for the mitral group, and 97% for the aortic-mitral group. There were 20 instances of xenograft failure (1.2% per patient-year). The probability of remaining free of valve failure at 5 years was 96% for the aortic valve replacement group, 93% for the mitral group, and 93% for the aortic-mitral replacement group. Primary tissue failure of a prosthesis occurred in seven patients, all with Hancock valves (0.43% per patient-year). As yet there has been no primary tissue failure of the Carpentier-Edwards prosthesis. There also appears to be a lower incidence of thromboembolism (Edwards, 0.3% per patient-year; Hancock, 0.8% per patient-year) and endocarditis (Edwards, 0.6% per patient-year; Hancock, 1.0% per patient-year). The low incidence of complications with the porcine bioprosthetic valve, especially the Carpentier-Edwards, encourages us to recommend its continued use, especially in situations in which anticoagulation is contraindicated."

Major European institutions report cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the first cause of death in adults, with cardiac arrest and sudden death due to coronary ischaemia as the primary single cause. Global incidence of CVD is decreasing in most European countries, due to prevention, lifestyle and treatment. Mortality of acute coronary events inside the hospital decreases more rapidly than outside the hospital. To improve the mortality of cardiac arrest outside the hospital, reliable epidemiological and process figures are essential: \"we can only manage what we can measure\". Europe is a patchwork of 47 countries (total population of 830 million), with a 10-fold difference in incidence of coronary heart disease between North and South, East and West, and a 5-fold difference in number of EMS-treated cardiac arrest (range 17-53/1000,000/year). Epidemiology of cardiac arrest should not be calculated as a European average, but it is appropriate to describe the incidence of cardiac arrest, the resuscitation process, and the outcome in each of the European regions, for benchmarking and quality management. Epidemiological reports of cardiac arrest should specify definitions, nominator (number of cases) and denominator (study population). Recently some regional registries in North America, Japan and Europe fulfilled these conditions. The European Registry of Cardiac Arrest (EuReCa) has the potential to achieve these objectives on a pan-European scale. For operational applications, the Utstein definition of \"Cardiac arrest\" is used which includes the potential of survival. For application in community health, the WHO definition of \"sudden death\" is frequently used, describing the mode of death. There is considerable overlap between both definitions. But this explains that no single method can provide all information. Integrating data from multiple sources (local, national, multinational registries and surveys, death certificates, post-mortem reports, community statistics, medical records) may create a holistic picture of cardiac arrest in the community."

The panmixia hypothesis--that all European eel (Anguilla anguilla) migrate to the Sargasso Sea for reproduction and comprise a single, randomly mating population--is widely accepted. If true, then this peculiar life history strategy would directly impact the population genetics of this species, and eels from European and north African rivers should belong to the same breeding population through the random dispersal of larvae. To date, the panmixia hypothesis has remained unchallenged: genetic studies realized on eel's mitochondrial DNA failed to detect any genetic structure; and a similar lack of structure was found using allozymes, with the exception of clinal variation imposed by selection. Here we have used highly polymorphic genetic markers that provide better resolution to investigate genetic structure in European eel. Analysis of seven microsatellite loci among 13 samples from the north Atlantic, the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea basins reveals that there is global genetic differentiation. Moreover, pairwise Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards chord distances correlate significantly with coastal geographical distance. This pattern of genetic structure implies non-random mating and restricted gene flow among eels from different sampled locations, which therefore refute the hypothesis of panmixia. Consequently, the reproductive biology of European eel must be reconsidered."

The signaling pathways leading to activation of autophagy in innate immunity are not well studied. Our recent study shows that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) serves as an environmental sensor for autophagy. We define a new molecular pathway in which lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces autophagy in human and murine macrophages by a pathway regulated through Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF)-dependent, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-independent TLR4 signaling.

This signaling pathway does not affect cell viability, indicating that it is distinct from an autophagic death signaling pathway. We further show that LPS-induced autophagy can enhance mycobacterial co-localization with the autophagosomes. The above study raises important questions. (1) What is the complete signaling pathway for LPS-induced autophagy? (2) Does TLR3 mediate autophagy? (3) What are the mechanisms that determine whether autophagy acts as a pro-death or pro-survival pathway? (4) What are the physiological functions of LPS-induced autophagosomes?

The concept of autophagic cell death was first established based on observations of increased autophagic markers in dying cells. The major limitation of such a morphology-based definition of autophagic cell death is that it fails to establish the functional role of autophagy in the cell death process, and thus contributes to the confusion in the literature regarding the role of autophagy in cell death and cell survival. Here we propose to define autophagic cell death as a modality of non-apoptotic or necrotic programmed cell death in which autophagy serves as a cell death mechanism, upon meeting the following set of criteria: (i) cell death occurs without the involvement of apoptosis; (ii) there is an increase of autophagic flux, and not just an increase of the autophagic markers, in the dying cells; and (iii) suppression of autophagy via both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic approaches is able to rescue or prevent cell death. In light of this new definition, we will discuss some of the common problems and difficulties in the study of autophagic cell death and also revisit some well-reported cases of autophagic cell death, aiming to achieve a better understanding of whether autophagy is a real killer, an accomplice or just an innocent bystander in the course of cell death. At present, the physiological relevance of autophagic cell death is mainly observed in lower eukaryotes and invertebrates such as Dictyostelium discoideum and Drosophila melanogaster.

The current working definition of autophagy is the following: all processes in which intracellular material is degraded within the lysosome/vacuole and where the macromolecular constituents are recycled. There are several ways to classify the different types of autophagy. For example, we can separate autophagy into two primary types, based on the initial site of cargo sequestration. In particular, during microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy, uptake occurs directly at the limiting membrane of the lysosome or vacuole. In contrast, macroautophagy-whether selective or nonselective-and endosomal microautophagy involve sequestration within an autophagosome or an omegasome, or late endosomes/multivesicular bodies, respectively; the key point being that in these types of autophagy the initial sequestration event does not occur at the limiting membrane of the degradative organelle. In any case, the cargo is ultimately delivered into the lysosome or vacuole lumen for subsequent degradation. Thus, I think most autophagy researchers view the degradative organelle as the ultimate destination of the pathway. Indeed, this fits with the general concept that organelles allow reactions to be compartmentalized. With regard to the lysosome or vacuole, this also confers a level of safety by keeping the lytic contents away from the remainder of the cell. If we are willing to slightly modify our definition of autophagy, with a focus on \"degradation of a cell's own components through the lysosomal/vacuolar machinery,\" we can include a newly documented process, programmed nuclear destruction (PND)."

Furthermore, autophagy inhibition can sensitize cells to both apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death induced by SAHA, suggesting the therapeutic potential of autophagy targeting in combination with SAHA therapy. This study also raised a series of questions: What is the role of HDACs in regulating autophagy? Do individual HDACs have distinct functions in autophagy? How do HDACs regulate the nutrient-sensing kinase MTOR? Since SAHA-induced nonapoptotic cell death is not driven by autophagy, what then is the mechanism underlying the apoptosis-independent death?

What is the role of autophagy in vascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes? What is the main finding and its importance? Autophagy is decreased in the mesenteric arteries of type 2 diabetic mice, and stimulation of autophagy using rapamycin and trehalose improves vascular function, which is associated with normalization of myogenic response and endothelium-dependent relaxation. ABSTRACT Vascular dysfunction is a major complication in type 2 diabetes (T2D). It has been suggested that dysregulation of autophagy is associated with various cardiovascular diseases. However, the relationship between autophagy and vascular dysfunction in T2D remains unclear. Thus, we examined whether reduced autophagy is involved in vascular dysfunction and whether stimulation of autophagy could improve vascular function in diabetes. Ten- to twelve-week-old male type 2 diabetic (db- /db- ) mice and their control (db- /db+ ) mice were treated with rapamycin or trehalose. Mesenteric arteries (MAs) were mounted for arteriography and their diameter was measured. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining were assessed. Myogenic response (MR) was significantly increased, whereas endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) was significantly attenuated in the MAs of diabetic mice. These results were associated with increased expression of LC3II, p62 and beclin-1 in diabetic mice. Treatment with autophagy stimulators significantly reduced the potentiation of MR and improved EDR in the diabetic mice. Furthermore, autophagy stimulation normalized expression of LC3II, p62 and beclin-1 in the diabetic mice. In addition, phosphorylation level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was decreased in diabetic mice and was restored by rapamycin and trehalose. T2D impairs vascular function by dysregulated autophagy. Therefore, autophagy could be a potential target for overcoming diabetic microvascular complications."

BACKGROUND The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell effector mechanisms that limits immune responses against cancer. We tested the anti-PD-1 antibody lambrolizumab (previously known as MK-3475) in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS We administered lambrolizumab intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks in patients with advanced melanoma, both those who had received prior treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and those who had not. Tumor responses were assessed every 12 weeks. RESULTS A total of 135 patients with advanced melanoma were treated. Common adverse events attributed to treatment were fatigue, rash, pruritus, and diarrhea; most of the adverse events were low grade. The confirmed response rate across all dose cohorts, evaluated by central radiologic review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25 to 44), with the highest confirmed response rate observed in the cohort that received 10 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks (52%; 95% CI, 38 to 66). The response rate did not differ significantly between patients who had received prior ipilimumab treatment and those who had not (confirmed response rate, 38% [95% CI, 23 to 55] and 37% [95% CI, 26 to 49], respectively). Responses were durable in the majority of patients (median follow-up, 11 months among patients who had a response); 81% of the patients who had a response (42 of 52) were still receiving treatment at the time of analysis in March 2013. The overall median progression-free survival among the 135 patients was longer than 7 months. CONCLUSIONS In patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had had disease progression while they had been receiving ipilimumab, treatment with lambrolizumab resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE To review the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, formulary and economic considerations of pembrolizumab, a novel, first-in-class, anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for treatment of advanced melanoma. METHODS A literature search was conducted using PubMed (July 2013-December 2014) with search terms: pembrolizumab, MK-3475 and lambrolizumab. Additional sources were identified through a subsequent review of all relevant papers, clinicaltrials.gov, product labelling and media releases. All English-language studies conducted in humans with clinical data were included. Review papers were excluded from analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Patients with advanced melanoma have limited options available. Immune therapies have shown promise in treating advanced melanoma, but can have significant toxicities. Identification of the role of PD-1 in tumour immune evasion and the subsequent development of pembrolizumab, a novel agent that inhibits PD-1, has led to the availability of an additional treatment option for patients who have progressive disease despite treatment with currently approved agents. Phase I cohort studies have demonstrated promising overall response rates and an estimated progression-free survival of approximately 5\u00b75 months. Minimal toxicity has been observed in patients receiving pembrolizumab, although significant severe immune-mediated reactions have been reported. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Pembrolizumab is a novel anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody that is an effective option for advanced melanoma previously treated with agents such as ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors. Additional studies will provide the necessary data for determining its true place in therapy for advanced melanoma and exploring its efficacy in additional malignant indications."

In three years, four drugs have gained regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic and unresectable melanoma, with at least seven other drugs having recently completed, currently in, or soon to be in phase III clinical testing. This amazing achievement has been made following a remarkable increase of knowledge in molecular biology and immunology that led to the identification of high-valued therapeutic targets and the clinical development of agents that effectively engage and inhibit these targets. The discovery of either effective molecularly targeted therapies or immunotherapies would have led to dramatic improvements to the standard-of-care treatment of melanoma.

Many of inherited diseases and human development violates Mendelian law of inheritance, this way of inheriting is studied by epigenetics. AIM The aim of this review is to analyze current opinions and options regarding to this way of inheriting. RESULTS Epigenetics shows that gene expression undergoes changes more complex than modifications in the DNA sequence; it includes the environmental influence on the gametes before conception. Humans inherit two alleles from mother and father, both are functional for the majority of the genes, but sometimes one is turned off or \"stamped\" and doesn't show in offspring, that gene is imprinted. Imprinting means that that gene is silenced, and gene from other parent is expressed. The mechanisms for imprinting are still incompletely defined, but they involve epigenetic modifications that are erased and then reset during the creation of eggs and sperm. Genomic imprinting is a process of silencing genes through DNA methylation. The repressed allele is methylated, while the active allele is unmethylated. The most well-known conditions include Prader-Willi syndrome, and Angelman syndrome. Both of these syndromes can be caused by imprinting or other errors involving genes on the long arm of chromosome 15. CONCLUSIONS Genomic imprinting and other epigenetic mechanisms such as environment is shown that plays role in offspring neurodevelopment and autism spectrum disorder."

The precise mechanism responsible for the imprint, or allele-specific behavior of gene transcription, is still unclear; it is thought that modifications not involving the DNA base sequence (therefore, epigenetic as opposed to genetic) have occurred during the production of egg and sperm that mark genes according to parental origin. Several imprinted genes have been identified that also show allelic differences in cytosine methylation and in the timing of their replication during cell division; the relevance of this finding to imprinting mechanisms awaits further clarification. Despite our incomplete knowledge, the importance of the field of imprinting to the pediatrician is in its contribution to our understanding of the transmission behavior of many human diseases and syndromes, particularly those involving abnormal growth and development.

The term \"imprinting\" refers to parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression. The presence of imprinted genes can cause cells with a full parental complement of functional autosomal genes to specifically express one allele but not the other, resulting in monoallelic expression of the imprinted loci. Genomic imprinting plays a critical role in fetal growth and behavioral development, and it is regulated by DNA methylation and chromatin structure. This paper summarizes the Genomic Imprinting and Environmental Disease Susceptibility Conference held 8-10 October 1998 at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina. The conference focused on the importance of genomic imprinting in determining susceptibility to environmentally induced diseases. Conference topics included rationales for imprinting: parental antagonism and speciation; methods for imprinted gene identification: allelic message display and monochromosomal mouse/human hybrids; properties of the imprinted gene cluster human 11p15.5 and mouse distal 7; the epigenetics of X-chromosome inactivation; variability in imprinting: imprint erasure, non-Mendelian inheritance ratios, and polymorphic imprinting; imprinting and behavior: genetics of bipolar disorder, imprinting in Turner syndrome, and imprinting in brain development and social behavior; and aberrant methylation: methylation and chromatin structure, methylation and estrogen exposure, methylation of tumor-suppressor genes, and cancer susceptibility. Environmental factors are capable of causing epigenetic changes in DNA that can potentially alter imprint gene expression and that can result in genetic diseases including cancer and behavioral disorders. Understanding the contribution of imprinting to the regulation of gene expression will be an important step in evaluating environmental influences on human health and disease."

OBJECTIVES To examine the relation between bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and the contribution of depression, anxiety and impaired sleep quality to that association. METHODS A three-centre case-control study was conducted consisting of 887 consecutive clinically-diagnosed bruxism patients aged 18-75 years and 887 matched controls. Diagnosis of GERD was based on the Montreal definition: moderate/severe symptoms \u2265 one day/week or mild symptoms \u2265 two days/week. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between bruxism and GERD. Mediation analyses were used to test whether the association between bruxism and GERD was mediated by depression, anxiety or impaired sleep quality. RESULTS Binary logistic regression identified that GERD was associated with bruxism (odds ratio, 6.87; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.34-10.88). This association was stronger in females (odds ratio, 12.27; 95% CI, 5.81-25.91) than in males (odds ratio, 3.99; 95% CI, 2.17-7.32). Multinomial logistic regression identified that GERD was associated with all types of bruxism (sleep bruxism alone, odds ratio, 6.71, 95% CI, 4.22-10.68; awake bruxism alone, odds ratio, 13.06, 95% CI, 5.32-32.05; overlap of sleep bruxism and awake bruxism, odds ratio, 6.48, 95% CI, 3.05-13.77). Ordinal logistic regression identified that longer GERD duration (> 2 years vs \u2264 2 years) was associated with bruxism frequency (odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.10-2.05). Mediation analyses found that the association between bruxism and GERD was partially-mediated through depression, anxiety and impaired sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS Clinically-diagnosed bruxism is associated with symptomatic GERD and is partially-mediated through depression, anxiety and impaired sleep quality. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Because bruxism is strongly associated with symptomatic GERD and patients with frequent bruxism symptoms tend to suffer from GERD for extensive time-periods, dentists should consider evaluation of GERD status as an elemental part of the medical examination of bruxism, especially severe bruxism."

Bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) can lead to wear of the dental tissues. Wear has a mechanical or chemical origin, and it is of extrinsic or intrinsic type. Bruxism and GERD are two etiological factors of dental wear. The intrinsic mechanical wear (abfraction) of Bruxism and intrinsic chemical wear (erosion) of GERD are both involved in sleep disorders; indeed, they could have associations and act in synergy in dental wear. The purpose of this review was to find out the possible associations between bruxism and GERD and their effects on tooth wear. The research was conducted on PubMed and the Cochrane Library using the following Keywords/Mesh Terms: Tooth wear, Bruxism, Sleep Bruxism, Sleep Disorders, or GERD. Only systematic reviews and clinical studies performed exclusively on human subjects were included in the review. Initially, the research gave more than 630 results on dental wear, bruxism and GERD and after application of the inclusion criteria irrelevant studies were excluded, and 5 studies were finally included in this review. It was possible to observe the presence of some associations between the two problems (reflux and GERD) and hypothesize negative effects on tooth wear. This research revealed the presence of an interconnection between these three problems (reflux, GERD and tooth wear) that can further act in synergy by attacking the hard dental tissues both from a chemical (reflux) and mechanical (bruxism) point of view. The dentist could play a role of \"sentinel\" in a multidisciplinary team, intercepting these problems early in order to treat them in the most appropriate way.

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (SB), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, no robust evidence supports the association between SB and GERD. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between SB and GERD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-five individuals were eligible to participate in this observational transversal study at the Gastroenterology Service of the Clinical Hospital of Porto Alegre, Brazil. The participants were classified into 2 groups, those with and without GERD, according to the Montreal Criteria and pH-metry/endoscopy findings. The diagnosis of SB was not assessed in a sleep laboratory but was based on self-report plus clinical inspection, according to the minimal diagnostic criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The Lipp Stress Symptom Inventory was used to evaluate self-perceived stress. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed with SB as dependent variable and GERD, sex, age, body mass index, and stress as predictors (\u03b1=.05; 90% power). RESULTS The study population included individuals with SB without GERD (13.3%) and individuals with SB with GERD (31.1%). In participants with GERD, the prevalence of SB was 73.7%. Only the variable GERD was significantly associated with SB (P=.017; odds ratio 6.58; 95% confidence interval 1.40-30.98), although adjusted for stress and age. CONCLUSIONS Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB."

DESIGN Controlled descriptive study and double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study. SETTING Portable pH monitoring, electromyography, and audio-video recordings were conducted during the night in the subjects' home. PARTICIPANTS Ten patients with bruxism and 10 normal subjects were matched for height, weight, age, and sex. They did not have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. INTERVENTION Medication with a proton pump inhibitor (ie, a gastric-acid-inhibiting drug). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The bruxism group showed a significantly higher frequency of nocturnal rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) episodes (mean +/- SD: 6.7 +/- 2.2 times per hour) and a higher frequency and percentage of time of gastroesophageal reflux episodes with a pH less than 4.0 and 5.0 (0.5 +/- 0.9 and 3.6 +/- 1.6 times per hour and 1.3% +/- 2.5% and 7.4% +/- 12.6%, respectively) than the control group (RMMA episodes: 2.4 +/- 0.9 times per hour; gastroesophageal reflux episodes: 0.0 +/- 0.0 and 0.1 +/- 0.3 times per hour and 0.0% +/- 0.0% and 0.0% +/- 0.0%, respectively). In the bruxism group, 100% of the gastroesophageal reflux episodes with a pH less than 3.0 and 4.0 included both an RMMA episode and an electromyographic burst, the duration of which was approximately 0.5 to 1.0 seconds, probably representing swallowing of saliva. The majority of gastroesophageal reflux episodes with a pH of 4.0 to 5.0 also included both an RMMA episode and an electromyographic burst in the control and bruxism groups (100% +/- 0.0% vs 70.7% +/- 16.5%), again probably due to swallowing of saliva. The remaining minority of gastroesophageal reflux episodes with a pH of 4.0 to 5.0 contained only an electromyographic burst (swallowing of saliva). The frequency of RMMA episodes after the release of the medication from the proton pump inhibitor, which increased the gastric and esophageal pH, was significantly lower than that after administration of the placebo in the control and bruxism groups (1.0 +/- 0.6 vs 1.9 +/- 3.2 times per hour, and 3.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 6.0 +/- 2.2 times per hour, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Nocturnal bruxism may be secondary to nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, occurring via sleep arousal and often together with swallowing. The physiologic link between bruxism and the increase in salivation needs to be investigated."

STUDY OBJECTIVES Sleep bruxism is an involuntary mandibular movement with tooth grinding during sleep. The prevalence of sleep bruxism in children is high and may lead to frequent arousals with altered daytime functioning. We investigated the sleep architecture, the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux, and the daytime cognitive behavioral functioning in a group of children with sleep bruxism. DESIGN-PATIENTS: This prospective pilot study included 10 children. Polysomnographic data with pH-probe analysis was compared with 10 age- and sex-matched controls. Each patient completed a dental evaluation, a nighttime polysomnogram, and cognitive behavioral tests (Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test and Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist). RESULTS Eight of 10 children had clinically significant bruxism and the 2 remaining patients had recent teeth exfoliation. There was no difference on sleep architecture between patients and controls, except for a higher arousal index for the bruxism group (36.7 vs 20.7, p < .007). Sleep bruxism occurred more frequently in stage 2 and rapid eye movement sleep, with arousals in 66% of the cases. There was no relationship of bruxism to gastroesophageal reflux or intelligence. However, 40% of the patients had elevated scores on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, indicating significant attention and behavior problems, and there were moderate correlations between the arousal index and several of the behavior-problem scales from the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (0.5 to 0.6). CONCLUSIONS The data suggest that children with bruxism have a higher arousal index, which may be associated with an increased incidence of attention-behavior problems. Future studies investigating pediatric sleep bruxism will need to focus on behavior issues that may be prevalent in this population."

BACKGROUND There are few large-scale epidemiologic studies examining the associations between sleep problems, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms, lifestyle and food habits and problem behaviors (PB) in adolescents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations among these factors in Japanese adolescents. METHODS A cross-sectional survey of 1840 junior high school students was carried out using questionnaires. The subjects were classified into PB or normal behavior (NB) groups using the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC). The scores of the sleep-related factors, sleep bruxism, lifestyle and food habits, and GERD symptoms were compared. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors related to PB. RESULTS Mean subject age was 13.3 \u00b1 1.8 years. The PB group had significantly longer sleep latency and higher GERD symptom score (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the PB group was significantly more likely to experience absence of the mother at dinner time, skip breakfast, and have <30 min of conversation among family at dinner time. The PB group had significantly higher frequencies of sleep bruxism, difficulty falling asleep within 30 min, nightmares, feeling of low sleep quality, daytime somnolence, and daytime lack of motivation. Feelings of low sleep quality had the strongest association with PB, with an adjusted odds ratio of 12.88 (95% confidence interval: 8.99-18.46).

Brodalumab is a novel fully human immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody that antagonizes the interleukin (IL)-17 pathway by binding with high affinity to human IL-17RA. The role of IL-17A in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, as well as the remarkable effectiveness of IL-17 inhibitors in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, is well established. The mechanism of action of brodalumab is unique in that it inhibits the IL-17 receptor compared to the two other currently FDA-approved IL-17 inhibitors, secukinumab and ixekizumab, which inhibit the IL-17A molecule itself. The efficacy of brodalumab in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis has been demonstrated in phase 2 and 3 trials, and subsequently the FDA approved this medication in February 2017. Brodalumab was approved in Japan in July 2016 and approval is pending in Europe. The safety and adverse effects of brodalumab were reviewed across several clinical trials, which, similar to other IL-17 inhibitors, demonstrated increased rates of neutropenia and Candida infections. Brodalumab treatment, similar to ixekizumab and secukinumab, showed no improvement in inflammatory bowel disease patients, and on the contrary, more exacerbations were encountered.

The main objective of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of brodalumab, ixekizumab and secukinumab (three anti-interleukin-17 drugs) through adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs). METHODS A search was carried out in June 2019, consulting these databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Studies including patients with moderate to severe psoriasis randomized to receive treatment with anti-interleukin-17 drugs or ustekinumab and with outcomes such as Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 scores or static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA), were included. ITCs were carried out using the method proposed by Bucher et al RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Five randomized clinical trials were included. Analysing short-term data, there were no statistically significant differences between any pair of drugs in terms of PASI 75, PASI 100 or sPGA/sIGA 0/1. Analysing long-term data, statistically significant differences were only observed for secukinumab versus brodalumab in terms of PASI 100 (Absolute risk reduction -12.9%; 95% confidence interval -22.7% to -3.1%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION The ITCs indicated no efficacy differences between anti-interleukin-17 drugs, except for secukinumab versus brodalumab 52-week analysis in terms of achieving PASI 100. All three drugs appear to act as equivalent clinical treatments for psoriasis. However, independent head-to-head trials should be carried out."

INTRODUCTION Nail changes are frequent clinical findings in patients with cutaneous psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, often causing significant impairments in quality of life. Numerous targeted therapies have been previously studied for treatment of nail psoriasis, however, newer agents have not been captured in prior systematic reviews. With over 25 new studies published since 2020, the landscape of nail psoriasis systemic treatments is rapidly evolving, warranting analysis of recently approved therapies. METHODS An updated systematic review of all PubMed and OVID database studies assessing efficacy and safety of targeted therapies for nail psoriasis was performed, with the goal of incorporating clinical data of recent trials and newer agents, namely brodalumab, risankizumab, and tildrakizumab. Eligibility criteria included clinical human studies reporting at least one of the nail psoriasis clinical appearance outcomes (Nail Psoriasis Severity Index, modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index). RESULTS A total of 68 studies on 15 nail psoriasis targeted therapeutic agents were included. Biological agents and small molecule inhibitors included TNF-alpha inhibitors (adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, certolizumab, golimumab), IL-17 inhibitors (ixekizumab, brodalumab, secukinumab), IL-12/23 inhibitors (ustekinumab), IL-23 inhibitors (guselkumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab), PDE-4 inhibitors (apremilast), and JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib). These agents all demonstrated statistically significant improvements in nail outcome scores, compared with placebo or with baseline values, at weeks 10-16 and weeks 20-26, with some studies assessing efficacy up to week 60. Safety data for these agents were acceptable and consistent with known safety profiles within these timepoints, with nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions, headache, and diarrhea being the most reported adverse events. Specifically, the newer agents, brodalumab, risankizumab, and tildrakizumab, showed promising outcomes for treatment of nail psoriasis on the basis of current data. CONCLUSION Numerous targeted therapies have shown significant efficacy in improving nail findings in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Data from head-to-head trials have shown greater efficacy of ixekizumab over adalimumab and ustekinumab, as well as brodalumab over ustekinumab, while prior meta-analyses have demonstrated superiority of ixekizumab and tofacitinib to other included agents at various assessed timepoints. Further studies on the long-term efficacy and safety of these agents, as well as randomized controlled trials involving comparison with placebo arms, are needed to fully analyze differences in efficacy of newer agents compared with previously established therapies."

The noncovalent complex of BTB and R8 is characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which indicates hydrogen bonding between the two constituents. Attachment of the peptide moiety renders aqueous solubility to the hydrophobic benzenesulfonamide drug and bestows bactericidal activity. Confocal imaging in conjunction with dye probes shows successful clearance of intracellular Staphylococcus aureus bacteria by the BTB-R8 complex. Scanning electron micrographs and studies with a set of fluorescent dyes suggest active disruption of the bacterial cell membrane by the BTB-R8 complex. In contrast, the complex of BTB with octalysine (K8) fails to cause membrane damage and displays a modest antibacterial effect. A complex of BTB with the water-soluble hydrophilic polymer poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) does not display any antibacterial effect, indicating the distinctive role of the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) R8 in the cognate complex. The leakage of the encapsulated dye from giant unilamellar vesicles upon interaction with the BTB-R8 complex further highlights the membrane activity of the complex, which cannot be accomplished by bare sulfonamide alone. This work broadens the scope of use of CPPs with respect to eliciting antibacterial activity and potentially expands the limited arsenal of membrane-targeting antibiotics."

Leishmaniases are a collection of neglected tropical diseases caused by kinetoplastid parasites in the genus Leishmania. Current chemotherapies are severely limited, and the need for new antileishmanials is of pressing international importance. Bromodomains are epigenetic reader domains that have shown promising therapeutic potential for cancer therapy and may also present an attractive target to treat parasitic diseases. Here, we investigate Leishmania donovani bromodomain factor 5 (LdBDF5) as a target for antileishmanial drug discovery. LdBDF5 contains a pair of bromodomains (BD5.1 and BD5.2) in an N-terminal tandem repeat. We purified recombinant bromodomains of L. donovani BDF5 and determined the structure of BD5.2 by X-ray crystallography. Using a histone peptide microarray and fluorescence polarization assay, we identified binding interactions of LdBDF5 bromodomains with acetylated peptides derived from histones H2B and H4. In orthogonal biophysical assays including thermal shift assays, fluorescence polarization, and NMR, we showed that BDF5 bromodomains bind to human bromodomain inhibitors SGC-CBP30, bromosporine, and I-BRD9; moreover, SGC-CBP30 exhibited activity against Leishmania promastigotes in cell viability assays. These findings exemplify the potential BDF5 holds as a possible drug target in Leishmania and provide a foundation for the future development of optimized antileishmanial compounds targeting this epigenetic reader protein."

A method for assessing genomic similarity based on relative abundances of short oligonucleotides in large DNA samples is introduced. The method requires neither homologous sequences nor prior sequence alignments. The analysis centers on (i) dinucleotide (and tri- and tetra-) relative abundance extremes in genomic sequences, (ii) distances between sequences based on all dinucleotide relative abundance values, and (iii) a multidimensional partial ordering protocol. The emphasis in this paper is on assessments of general relatedness of genomes as distinguished from phylogenetic reconstructions. Our methods demonstrate that the relative abundance distances almost always differ more for genomic interspecific sequence comparisons than for genomic intraspecific sequence comparisons, indicating congruence over different genome sequence samples. The genomic comparisons are generally concordant with accepted phylogenies among vertebrate and among fungal species sequences. Several unexpected relationships between the major groups of metazoa, fungal, and protist DNA emerge, including the following. (i) Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in dinucleotide relative abundance distances are as similar to each other as human is to bovine. (ii) S. cerevisiae, although substantially far from, is significantly closer to the vertebrates than are the invertebrates (Drosophila melanogaster, Bombyx mori, and Caenorhabditis elegans). This phenomenon may suggest variable evolutionary rates during the metazoan radiations and slower changes in the fungal divergences, and/or a polyphyletic origin of metazoa. (iii) The genomic sequences of D. melanogaster and Trypanosoma brucei are strikingly similar. This DNA similarity might be explained by some molecular adaptation of the parasite to its dipteran (tsetse fly) host, a host-parasite gene transfer hypothesis. Robustness of the methods may be due to a genomic signature of dinucleotide relative abundance values reflecting DNA structures related to dinucleotide stacking energies, constraints of DNA curvature, and mechanisms attendant to replication, repair, and recombination."

Strand biases reflect deviations from a null expectation of DNA evolution that assumes strand-symmetric substitution rates. Here, we present strong evidence that nearest-neighbour preferences are a strand-biased feature of bacterial genomes, indicating neighbour-dependent substitution asymmetries. To detect such asymmetries we introduce an alignment free index (relative abundance skews). The profiles of relative abundance skews along coding sequences can trace the phylogenetic relations of bacteria, suggesting that the patterns of neighbour-dependent substitution strand-biases are not common among different lineages, but are rather species-specific. Analysis of neighbour-dependent and codon-site skews sheds light on the origins of substitution asymmetries. Via a simple model we argue that the structure of the genetic code imposes position-dependent substitution strand-biases along coding sequences, as a response to GC mutation pressure. Thus, the organization of the genetic code per se can lead to an uneven distribution of nucleotides among different codon sites, even when requirements for specific codons and amino-acids are not accounted for. Moreover, our results suggest that strand-biases in replication fidelity of PolIII \u03b1-subunit induce substitution asymmetries, both neighbour-dependent and independent, on a genome scale. The role of DNA repair systems, such as transcription-coupled repair, is also considered."

Strand asymmetries, including GC skews and mutational biases, have shaped the nucleotide composition of diverse organisms.

Improvements in our ability to detect and quantify DNA strand asymmetries will provide insights into diverse functionalities of the genome, the contribution of different mutational mechanisms in germline and somatic mutagenesis, and our knowledge of genome instability and evolution, which all have significant clinical implications in human disease, including cancer.

Based on 152 mitochondrial genomes and 36 bacterial chromosomes that have been completely sequenced, as well as three long contigs for human chromosomes 6, 21, and 22, we examined skews of mononucleotide frequencies and the relative abundance of dinucleotides in one DNA strand. Each group of these genomes has its own characteristics. Regarding mitochondrial genomes, both CpG and GpT are underrepresented, while either GpG or CpC or both are overrepresented. The relative frequency of nucleotide T vs A and of nucleotide G vs C is strongly skewed, due presumably to strand asymmetry in replication errors and unidirectional DNA replication from single origins. Exceptions are found in the plant and yeast mitochondrial genomes, each of which may replicate from multiple origins. Regarding bacterial genomes, the \"universal\" rule of CpG deficiency is restricted to archaebacteria and some eubacteria. In other eubacteria, the most underrepresented dinucleotide is either TpA or GpT. In general, there are significant T vs A and G vs C skews in each half of the bacterial genome, although these are almost exactly canceled out over the whole genome. Regarding human chromosomes 6, 21, and 22, dinucleotide CpG tends to be avoided. The relative frequency of mononucleotides exhibits conspicuous local skews, suggesting that each of these chromosomal segments contains more than one DNA replication origin. It is concluded that, when there are several replicons in a genomic region, not only the number of DNA replication origins but also the directionality is important and that the observed patterns of nucleotide frequencies in the genome strongly support the hypothesis of strand asymmetry in replication errors."

In the post genomic era, access to complete genome sequence data for numerous diverse species has opened multiple avenues for examining and comparing primary DNA sequence organization of entire genomes. Previously, the concept of a genomic signature was introduced with the observation of species-type specific Dinucleotide Relative Abundance Profiles (DRAPs); dinucleotides were identified as the subsequences with the greatest bias in representation in a majority of genomes. Herein, we demonstrate that DRAP is one particular genomic signature contained within a broader spectrum of signatures. Within this spectrum, an alternative genomic signature, Chaos Game Representation (CGR), provides a unique visualization of patterns in sequence organization. A genomic signature is associated with a particular integer order or subsequence length that represents a measure of the resolution or granularity in the analysis of primary DNA sequence organization. We quantitatively explore the organizational information provided by genomic signatures of different orders through different distance measures, including a novel Image Distance. The Image Distance and other existing distance measures are evaluated by comparing the phylogenetic trees they generate for 26 complete mitochondrial genomes from a diversity of species. The phylogenetic tree generated by the Image Distance is compatible with the known relatedness of species. Quantitative evaluation of the spectrum of genomic signatures may be used to ultimately gain insight into the determinants and biological relevance of the genome signatures."

To understand the importance of plasmids in horizontal gene transfer, we need to gain insight into the 'evolutionary history' of these plasmids, i.e. the range of hosts in which they have evolved. Since extensive data support the proposal that foreign DNA acquires the host's nucleotide composition during long-term residence, comparison of nucleotide composition of plasmids and chromosomes could shed light on a plasmid's evolutionary history. The average absolute dinucleotide relative abundance difference, termed delta-distance, has been commonly used to measure differences in dinucleotide composition, or 'genomic signature', between bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. Here, we introduce the Mahalanobis distance, which takes into account the variance-covariance structure of the chromosome signatures. We demonstrate that the Mahalanobis distance is better than the delta-distance at measuring genomic signature differences between plasmids and chromosomes of potential hosts. We illustrate the usefulness of this metric for proposing candidate long-term hosts for plasmids, focusing on the virulence plasmids pXO1 from Bacillus anthracis, and pO157 from Escherichia coli O157:H7, as well as the broad host range multi-drug resistance plasmid pB10 from an unknown host."

OBJECT The Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) was a large, prospective clinical trial that examined whether superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass, in addition to best medical therapy, reduced the risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke in patients with carotid artery occlusion and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia. Despite improved cerebral hemodynamics and excellent bypass graft patency rates, COSS failed to show a benefit for the surgical group with respect to ipsilateral stroke recurrence at 2 years after treatment. This was due to a lower than expected rate of recurrent ipsilateral stroke in the medically treated group and a high rate of perioperative ipsilateral strokes in the surgical group. Critics of the trial have cited surgeon inexperience and technical difficulties related to the performance of the bypass graft as a leading cause of failure of the trial. METHODS The authors retrospectively identified all patients from the COSS with an ipsilateral, perioperative (< 30 days) ischemic stroke after STA-MCA cortical branch anastomosis. Study records, operative notes, stroke adjudication forms, and imaging studies were reviewed. Ischemic strokes were characterized as bypass graft related or non-bypass graft related based on clinical and radiographic findings. RESULTS Fourteen of 93 surgically treated patients experienced an ipsilateral, perioperative ischemic stroke. Postoperatively, the mean oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebral hemisphere significantly improved in these patients (1.30 \u00b1 0.18 preoperative vs 1.12 \u00b1 0.11 postoperative; p = 0.02), but did not normalize. In this cohort, total MCA occlusion time during the anastomosis (54.3 \u00b1 23.5 minutes) was no different from the MCA occlusion time in those surgical patients who did not have a perioperative stroke (45.4 \u00b1 24.2 minutes, p = 0.2). Bypass graft patency rates in patients with a perioperative stroke were 92% at 30 days (11 of 12 patients with patency data) and 83% at last follow-up visit (10 of 12 patients with patency data). These patency rates were not significantly different from those achieved at 30 days (100%; 76 of 76 patients with patency data; p = 0.14) and at last follow-up (99%; 71 of 72 patients with patency data; p = 0.052) in patients without a perioperative stroke. Eighty-six percent (12 of 14 patients) of strokes were likely attributable to factors unrelated to the STA-MCA anastomosis. Only 21% of strokes (3 of 14 patients) were in the territory of the recipient vessel and likely related to technical performance of the anastomosis itself. One patient was thought to have dual stroke mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS Only a small minority of ipsilateral, perioperative ischemic strokes in the COSS could be attributed to technical problems of the bypass anastomosis. The majority of ischemic strokes could not be ascribed to this cause and were most likely due to patient hemodynamic fragility and the inability of patients to tolerate surgery."

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE The publication of the COSS (Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study) trial in 2011 concluded that the addition of external carotid to internal carotid (EC-IC) bypass to a medical regimen \"did not reduce the risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke at 2 years\" for patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion. This has resulted in decreasing referrals for surgical management under the guise of \"evidence-based\" medicine. The conclusions drawn from a study can only be as good as the selected end points. COSS did not consider important end points such as the effects of long-term cerebral ischemia or recurrent debilitating transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). However, the study is often quoted as \"proof\" that EC-IC bypass has no role in the treatment of these patients. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A middle-aged patient presented to a primary neurologist with left-sided weakness and 2 months of personality changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed small watershed infarcts in the right hemisphere. An angiogram showed right carotid occlusion. Perfusion scans confirmed hypoperfusion. The patient was managed medically. Without any further clinical stroke events, the patient progressed to complete hemispheric infarction on MRI over the next 5 months. CONCLUSION The public perception of the results of large randomized clinical trials is significantly altered by their ubiquitous dissemination and broad generalization without adequate understanding of the details. Careful assessment of the methodology and end points of a trial are essential when applying the results for evidence-based medicine to individual patients. This patient would have been considered a medical \"success\" in COSS, but her outcome with surgical intervention will never be known."

OBJECTIVECerebral revascularization for carotid occlusion was previously a mainstay procedure for the cerebrovascular neurosurgeon. However, the 1985 extracranial-intracranial bypass trial and subsequently the Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) provided level 1 evidence via randomized controlled trials against bypass for symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid occlusion disease. However, in a small number of patients optimal medical therapy fails, and some patients with flow-limiting stenosis develop a perfusion-dependent neurological examination. Therefore it is necessary to further stratify patients by risk to determine who may most benefit from this intervention as well as to determine perioperative morbidity in this high-risk patient population.METHODSA retrospective review was performed of all revascularization procedures done for symptomatic atherosclerotic cerebrovascular steno-occlusive disease. All patients undergoing revascularization after the publication of the COSS in 2011 were included. Perioperative morbidity and mortality were assessed as the primary outcome to determine safety of revascularization in this high-risk population. All patients had documented hypoperfusion on hemodynamic imaging.RESULTSAt total of 35 revascularization procedures were included in this review. The most common indication was for patients with recurrent strokes, who were receiving optimal medical therapy and who suffered from cerebrovascular steno-occlusion. At 30 days only 3 perioperative ischemic events were observed, 2 of which led to no long-term neurological deficit. Immediate graft patency was good, at 94%. Long term, no further strokes or ischemic events were observed, and graft patency remained high at 95%. There were no factors associated with perioperative ischemic events in the variables that were recorded.CONCLUSIONSCerebral revascularization may be done safely at high-volume cerebrovascular centers in high-risk patients in whom optimal medical therapy has failed. Further research must be done to develop an improved methodology of risk stratification for patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic cerebrovascular steno-occlusive disease to determine which patients may benefit from intervention. Given the high risk of recurrent stroke in certain patients, and the fact that patients fail medical therapy, surgical revascularization may provide the best method to ensure good long-term outcomes with manageable up-front risks."

OBJECT The Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) was conducted to determine if superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass, when added to the best medical therapy, would reduce subsequent ipsilateral stroke in patients with complete internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and an elevated oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in the cerebral hemisphere distal to the occlusion. A recent publication documented the methodology of the COSS in detail and briefly outlined the major findings of the trial. The surgical results of the COSS are described in detail in this report. METHODS The COSS was a prospective, parallel-group, 1:1 randomized, open-label, blinded-adjudication treatment trial. Participants, who had angiographically demonstrated complete occlusion of the ICA causing either a transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke within 120 days and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia indicated by an increased OEF measured by PET, were randomized to either surgical or medical treatment. One hundred ninety-five patients were randomized: 97 to the surgical group and 98 to the medical group. The surgical patients underwent an STA-MCA cortical branch anastomosis. RESULTS In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 2-year rates for the primary end point were 21% for the surgical group and 22.7% for the medical group (p = 0.78, log-rank test). Fourteen (15%) of the 93 patients who had undergone an arterial bypass had a primary end point ipsilateral hemispheric stroke in the 30-day postoperative period, 12 within 2 days after surgery. The STA-MCA arterial bypass patency rate was 98% at the 30-day postoperative visit and 96% at the last follow-up examination. The STA-MCA arterial bypass markedly improved, although it did not normalize, the level of elevated OEF in the symptomatic cerebral hemisphere. Five surgically treated and 1 nonsurgically treated patients in the surgical group had a primary end point ipsilateral hemispheric stroke after the 30-day postoperative period. No baseline characteristics or intraoperative variables revealed those who would experience a procedure-related stroke. CONCLUSIONS Despite excellent bypass graft patency and improved cerebral hemodynamics, STA-MCA anastomosis did not provide an overall benefit regarding ipsilateral 2-year stroke recurrence, mainly because of a much better than expected stroke recurrence rate (22.7%) in the medical group, but also because of a significant postoperative stroke rate (15%).

METHODS Increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) by positron emission tomography is a gold standard for ischemia, but the specific thresholds and equivalency of the semiquantitative OEF ratio utilized in COSS and quantitative OEF are at issue. RESULTS The semiquantitative hemispheric OEF ratio used in COSS did not identify the same group of patients as did quantitative OEF using a threshold of 50%. CONCLUSIONS The failure of COSS is likely caused by a failure of the semiquantitative, hemispheric OEF ratio method rather than by the selection for bypass based on hemodynamic compromise."

BACKGROUND There are limited data on outcomes of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass in patients with recurrent hemispheric syndromes due to atherosclerotic internal carotid artery occlusion (AICAO). OBJECTIVE To compare clinical outcomes and efficacy of EC-IC bypass surgery in patients with and without recurrent hemispheric syndromes associated with AICAO in the Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS). METHODS In patients enrolled in the COSS trial, we compared baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes for participants with (rHEMI+) and without recurrent hemispheric ischemia (rHEMI-) prior to randomization into surgical vs medical groups. The primary outcome was all stroke and death from randomization through 30 d and ipsilateral ischemic stroke within 2 yr. RESULTS Of 195 randomized participants, 100 were rHEMI+ (50 in each group). Baseline characteristics between rHEMI+ and rHEMI- participants were similar except rHEMI+ were more likely to have had previous stroke prior to randomization (61% vs 20%, P < .01) and to have TIA as the entry event (59% vs 21%, P < .01). All primary endpoints were ipsilateral ischemic strokes. There were no significant differences in occurrence of the primary endpoint between nonsurgical and surgical participants in rHEMI+ (26.3% vs 22.4%, P = .660) and rHEMI- (18.9% vs 19.5%, P = .943). For nonsurgical participants, there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint for rHEMI+ vs rHEMI- patients (P = .410). CONCLUSION Patients with recurrent hemispheric stroke syndromes enrolled in the COSS trial did not show benefit from EC-IC bypass compared to medical treatment. Early aggressive risk factor measures should be prioritized to reduce recurrent strokes in these patients."

Background and Purpose Despite the findings reported in the COSS (Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study), patients with atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease continue to be referred for superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass surgery. Here, we determined how today\u2019s patients differ from the population reported in COSS. Methods We retrospectively analyzed all patients that were referred to our Department for superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass surgery of atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease following the publication of COSS. Results Between 2012 and 2019, 179 patients were referred for 186 bypass surgeries. Ninety-one (51%) patients suffered atherosclerotic, unilateral internal carotid occlusion and 88 (49%) atherosclerotic multivessel disease. All patients had received intensive medical management. A single transitory ischemic attack or ischemic stroke within the last 120 days according to the inclusion criteria of COSS occurred in only 36 out of 179 (20%) patients, whereas 27 out of 179 (15%) suffered >1 transitory ischemic attack within 120 days, 109 out of 179 (61%) had recurrent minor ischemic stroke, and 7 out of 179 (4%) were hemodynamically unstable and required blood pressure maintenance. The distribution of symptoms did not differ between atherosclerotic unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion and atherosclerotic multivessel disease (P=0.376) but hemodynamic impairment was significantly greater in atherosclerotic multivessel disease (P<0.001 for atherosclerotic multivessel disease versus atherosclerotic unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion). The overall perioperative stroke rate was 4.3%. Conclusions Patients referred for flow augmentation surgery today appear to suffer more severe symptoms and vessel occlusion patterns than patients reported in COSS. A new, carefully designed randomized controlled trial appears warranted, considering the still poor prognosis of severe atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease."

The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines neuropathic pain as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. It is characterized as a clinical condition in which diagnostic studies reveal an underlying cause of an abnormality in the peripheral or central nervous system. Many common causes of neuropathic pain in adults are rare in children. The purpose of this focused narrative review is, to 1) provide an overview of neuropathic pain in children, 2) highlight unique considerations related to the diagnosis and mechanisms of neuropathic pain in children, and 3) perform a comprehensive analysis of the pharmacological treatments available. We emphasize that data for routine use of pharmacological agents in children with neuropathic pain are largely inferred from adult literature with little research performed on pediatric populations, yet have clear evidence of harms to pediatric patients. Based on these findings, we propose risk mitigation strategies such as utilizing topical treatments whenever possible, assessing pain phenotyping to guide drug class choice, and considering pharmaceuticals in the broader context of the multidisciplinary treatment of pediatric pain. Furthermore, we highlight important directions for future research on pediatric neuropathic pain treatment."

Validated diagnostic tools to diagnose chronic neuropathic and mixed pain in children are missing. Therapeutic options are often derived from therapeutics for adults. To investigate the international practice amongst practitioners for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic, neuropathic pain in children and adolescents, we performed a survey study among members of learned societies or groups whose members are known to treat pediatric pain. The survey included questions concerning practitioners and practice characteristics, assessment and diagnosis, treatment and medication. We analyzed 117 returned questionnaires, of which 41 (35%) were fully completed and 76 (65%) were partially completed. Most respondents based the diagnosis of neuropathic pain on physical examination (68 (58.1%)), patient history (67 (57.3%)), and underlying disease (59 (50.4%)) combined. Gabapentin, amitriptyline, and pregabalin were the first-choice treatments for moderate neuropathic pain. Tramadol, ibuprofen, amitriptyline, and paracetamol were the first-choice treatments for moderate mixed pain. Consensus on the diagnostic process of neuropathic pain in children and adolescents is lacking. Drug treatment varies widely for moderate, severe neuropathic, and mixed pain.

Neuropathic pain, i.e., pain resulting from functional changes in peripheral and central pathways subsequent to injury to the peripheral nervous system, offers a most difficult challenge to therapy. To date, only the antidepressants and the anticonvulsants have shown any effectiveness, albeit incomplete and inconsistent, and many questions remain unanswered: What are the exact indications for the antidepressants? What component of neuropathic pain do they relieve, and through which mechanisms? Which type of antidepressants should be prescribed? A first-generation tricyclic? Or a new compound with a selective action on serotonin reuptake? What are the effective dosage and duration of the treatment? What is it mechanism of action? What other antalgic effects do carbamazepine and baclofen possess apart from their action on trigeminal neuralgia? The opiates are generally considered to be without effect, but recent clinical and experimental findings seem to point otherwise. In the meantime, following a few simple rules will optimize the benefit of drug treatment in neuropathic pain: treatment tailored to individual cases; adequate dosage and duration of treatment. However, it is from the near future that breakthroughs are being expected, dues to the multiplication of animal models and more accurate analysis; new clinical evaluation tools which help in distinguishing the different mechanisms underlying the various aspects of pain; the development of new substances, such as capsaicin, local anesthetics, anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs for example); and better defined methodological conditions for therapeutic trials."

Five patients treated in the Children's Hospital Pain Control Service for intractable neuropathic pain were included in gabapentin treatment. Four were cancer patients and one suffered from neuropathic pain in the neck (C3). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores of pain were compared before and during treatment with gabapentin.

OBJECTIVE Neuropathic pain is undertreated in children. Neurosurgical treatments of pediatric chronic pain are limited by the absence of both US Food and Drug Administration approval and pediatric-specific hardware, as well as weak referral patterns due to a lack of physician education. This study presents a single-institution retrospective case series of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in children \u2264 19 years of age and a systematic review of SCS in children. The authors' findings may further validate the role of SCS as an effective treatment modality for varied neuropathic pain syndromes found in pediatric patients. METHODS The study was a single-center, single-surgeon, retrospective case series of individuals treated between July 2017 and May 2022. The outcomes for pediatric patients with chronic neuropathic pain syndromes indicated by the multidisciplinary pain clinic for evaluation for SCS were cataloged. A systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis was performed for cases treated until May 2022, using PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus to characterize outcomes of children with neuropathic pain treated with SCS. RESULTS Twelve patients were evaluated and 9 were indicated for percutaneous or buried lead trials. Seven female and 2 male patients between the ages of 13 and 19 years were implanted with trial leads. Eight of 9 (89%) patients went on to receive permanent systems. The average trial length was 6 days, and the length of stay for both trial and implant was less than 1 day. Complication rates due to CSF leaks were 22% and 0% for trial and implant, respectively. Visual analog scale pain scores decreased from 9.2 to 2.9 (p = 0.0002) and the number of medications decreased from 4.9 to 2.1 (p = 0.0005). Functional status also improved for each patient. A systematic review identified 13 studies describing pediatric patients with SCS, including 12 providing IPD on 30 patients. In the IPD meta-analysis, pain was reduced in 16/16 (100%) of patients following surgery and in 25/26 (96.2%) at last follow-up. Medication use was decreased in 16/21 (76.2%), and functional outcomes were improved in 29/29 (100%). The complication rate was 5/30 (16.7%). CONCLUSIONS SCS effectively decreases pain and medication use for pediatric neuropathic pain syndromes. Patients also report improved functional status, including improved matriculation, gainful employment, and physical activity. There is minimal high-quality literature describing neuromodulation for pain in children. Neuromodulation should be considered earlier as a viable alternative to escalating use of multiple drugs and as a potential mechanism to address tolerance, dependence, and addiction in pediatric patients."

Further studies showed that the expression of PTRF was regulated by SHC1 through EGFR-Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase/Akt pathway. PTRF was detected in the exosomes isolated from ccRCC patients' urine and ccRCC cancer cells culture medium.

Urinary exosomes are excreted from all nephron segments and may serve as biomarkers for classifying renal diseases. Isolation of urinary exosomes by the established ultracentrifugation method has some limitations for use in a clinical laboratory. We sought a rapid and simple way to obtain urinary exosomes. We used a commercially available nanomembrane concentrator to enrich exosomes from urine by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10-30 min. Urinary exosomal markers tumor susceptibility gene 101, aquaporin-2, neuron-specific enolase, annexin V, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and podocalyxin (PODXL) were recovered from the nanomembrane concentrator and detected by Western blotting, and typical features of urinary vesicles were found by electron microscopy. Exosomal markers were detected in as little as 0.5 ml of urine. By the nanomembrane method, exosomal proteins could be recovered from urine samples frozen at -80 degrees C or refrigerated overnight at 4 degrees C then stored at -80 degrees C. By enriching exosomes we could detect PODXL, a podocyte marker, which decreased by 71% in five male patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and abundant proteinuria. We conclude that 1) use of a nanomembrane concentrator simplifies and accelerates the enrichment of urinary exosomes; and 2) the nanomembrane concentrator can concentrate exosomal proteins from clinical urine samples.

Protein N-glycosylation plays a crucial role in the folding, transportation, and localization of proteins, and participates in many important biological processes such as receptor activation and signal transduction. An increasing number of studies have shown that abnormal protein glycosylation is closely related to various diseases. Therefore, N-glycosylated proteins are potential candidates for become new biomarkers or drug targets. The current research strategy for N-glycosylated proteins is to first digest the protease into peptides and then identify them by mass spectrometry. In sample preparation processing, enrichment and separation of N-glycopeptides have become the vital step for glycoproteomic analysis. However, because of their low abundance and poor ionization, mass spectrometric identification of N-glycopeptides in complex samples remains a challenging task. Therefore, the development of a selective enrichment strategy for N-glycopeptides from complex biological samples is necessary. In this work, new functional nanomaterials were prepared through a simple, convenient, and efficient two-step \"Au-S\" reaction. In short, the \"Au-S\" bond was first used to load nano-gold wires on the surface of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and then to connect these wires to 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPB). The resulting nanomaterial named MoS2/Au/4-MPB was successfully prepared by serial functionalization of ultra-thin two-dimensional MoS2, nano-gold wires and 4-MPB for the efficient enrichment of N-glycopeptides. The layered structure of molybdenum disulfide nanomaterials can provide numerous modifiable sites for the reaction, allowing for convenient modification of the nano-gold wires. The functional group 4-MPB has high affinity for N-glycopeptides, and it can selectively enrich them in biological samples. In order to evaluate the N-glycopeptide enrichment performance of MoS2/Au/4-MPB, standard proteins human immunoglobulin G (IgG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) trypsin digests were used. Thus, facilitated interactions with N-glycopeptides for boric acid-based retention could be expected. Low femtomolar detection sensitivity, 1:1000 enrichment selectivity, and 100 \u03bcg/mg loading capacity were achieved for N-glycopeptide enrichment. In the application of this material to biological samples, exosomes were chosen as the research objects. On the one hand, exosomes serve as a new class of carriers for intercellular communication and drug delivery. Almost all types of cells can secrete exosomes. On the other hand, urine is another potential source for liquid biopsy samples in addition to blood. Obtaining urine samples is a less invasive process, and urine samples are easier to handle and save as compared to blood samples. Exosomes can also be detected in urine. Cell-specific components such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids can provide diverse information, which is of great significance in disease diagnosis and treatment. However, there are only a few studies on urinary exosomes N-glycoprotein group. In this research, N-glycoproteins were successfully identified in urine exosomes. In three replicate experiments, 536, 515 and 487 N-glycosylated peptides were identified from 279, 270 and 279 N-glycoproteins, respectively. After de-duplication of the three sets of data, a total of 768 N-glycopeptides corresponding to 377 N-glycoproteins were identified. This result indicates that the novel nanocomposite has good enrichment selectivity and sensitivity for N-glycopeptides enrichment in complex biological samples, and this method provides a new method for glycoproteomics research."

Background Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus and a common cause of end-stage kidney disease. The incidence of DKD is rising worldwide and associated with increased morbidity and premature mortality, indicating an urgent need to further explore the underlying pathogenesis and potential biomarkers. Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles secreted by all cell types that play an essential role in cellular homeostasis and intercellular communications by transferring molecular cargoes between different cells. Summary Emerging evidence indicates that exosomes are both a crucial signaling mediator and a potential biomarker of DKD. On the one hand, exosomes released by various kidney resident cells facilitate the cell-cell crosstalk as a contributing factor in DKD; on the other hand, exosomes can be detected from urine and blood and have emerged as promising noninvasive biomarkers for DKD. Key Messages Herein, we highlight the recent advances in research on the role of exosomes from different kidney resident cells in DKD. We further discuss the potential use of urine exosomes as biomarkers and therapeutic agents."

BACKGROUND PCA3 and ERG are mRNA-based prostate cancer (PCa) specific biomarkers that can be detected in urine. However, urine is a complex substrate that can be separated in several fractions. In this study we compared the levels of PCa-specific biomarkers (PCA3 and ERG) and KLK3 as prostate-specific reference gene in three urine substrates-whole urine, urinary sediment (cell pellet) and exosomes-and evaluated the influence of performing a digital rectal examination (DRE) prior to urine sampling. METHODS First-voided urine samples were prospectively obtained before and after DRE from 29 men undergoing prostate biopsies. The urine was separated in whole urine, cell pellet and exosomes and the biomarker levels were measured with RT-qPCR. RESULTS PCa was identified in 52% (15/29) of men. In several samples the mRNA levels were below the analytical limit of detection (BDL). The biomarker levels were highest in whole urine and significantly higher after DRE in all substrates. In PCa patients higher levels of PCA3 and ERG were found in all urine substrates after DRE compared to non-PCa patients. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study in which urinary PCa-specific biomarker levels were compared directly in three separate urine fractions. These results suggest that whole urine could be the urine substrate of choice for PCa-diagnostics based on analytical sensitivity, which is reflected directly in the high informative rate. Moreover, the significant positive effect of performing a DRE prior to urine sampling is confirmed. These findings could be of influence in the development of PCa-diagnostic urine tests."

BACKGROUND Recently, nanometer sized vesicles (termed exosomes) have been described as a component of urine. Such vesicles may be a useful non-invasive source of markers in renal disease. Their utility as a source of markers in urological cancer remains unstudied. Our aim in this study was to investigate the feasibility and value of analysing urinary exosomes in prostate cancer patients undergoing standard therapy. METHODS Ten patients (with locally advanced PCa) provided spot urine specimens at three time points during standard therapy. Patients received 3-6 months neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy prior to radical radiotherapy, comprising a single phase delivering 55 Gy in 20 fractions to the prostate and 44 Gy in 20 fractions to the pelvic nodes. Patients were continued on adjuvant ADT according to clinical need. Exosomes were purified, and the phenotype compared to exosomes isolated from the prostate cancer cell line LNcaP. A control group of 10 healthy donors was included. Serum PSA was used as a surrogate treatment response marker. Exosomes present in urine were quantified, and expression of prostate markers (PSA and PSMA) and tumour-associated marker 5T4 was examined. RESULTS The quantity and quality of exosomes present in urine was highly variable, even though we handled all materials freshly and used methods optimized for obtaining highly pure exosomes. There was approx 2-fold decrease in urinary exosome content following 12 weeks ADT, but this was not sustained during radiotherapy. Nevertheless, PSA and PSMA were present in 20 of 24 PCa specimens, and not detected in healthy donor specimens. There was a clear treatment-related decrease in exosomal prostate markers in 1 (of 8) patient. CONCLUSION Evaluating urinary-exosomes remains difficult, given the variability of exosomes in urine specimens. Nevertheless, this approach holds promise as a non-invasive source of multiple markers of malignancy that could provide clinically useful information."

Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among males worldwide. However, the biomarker for diagnosing prostate cancer that is used currently has limitations that must be overcome. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that the cancer liquid biopsy can be implemented by using exosome miRNAs. However, the current methods for the detection of exosome miRNAs are time-consuming, expensive, and laborious. Thus, we investigated a novel method for diagnosing prostate cancer that involves the use of molecular beacons for the in situ detection of miRNAs in exosomes from prostate cancer cells. We chose miRNA-375 and miRNA-574-3p as the target miRNAs for prostate cancer, and these markers in exosomes produced by prostate cancer cells including DU145 and PC-3 were successfully detected using molecular beacons. High fluorescent signals were obtained from MB and miRNA hybridization in exosomes in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, exosome miRNAs can be detected even in the presence of human urine, so this method can be applied directly using human urine to perform liquid biopsies for prostate cancer. Overall, the in situ detection of exosome miRNAs using molecular beacons can be developed as a simple, cost effective, and non-invasive liquid biopsy for diagnosing prostate cancer."

We report the functional characterization of a previously unrecognized synonymous variant, c.891C>T (p.Cys297Cys), identified in the SPINK5 exon 11 of an NS patient.

Subsequent minigene splicing assays and in silico predictions confirmed the direct role of the synonymous mutation in inhibiting exon 11 inclusion by a mechanism that involves the activity of exonic regulatory sequences, namely splicing enhancer and silencer. However, this deleterious effect was not complete and a residual amount of normal mRNA and LEKTI protein could be detected, correlating with the relatively mild patient's phenotype.

Life-threatening complications during infancy include temperature and electrolyte imbalance, recurrent infections, and failure to thrive. To study the clinical presentations of the Com\u00e8l-Netherton syndrome and its molecular cause, we ascertained 19 unrelated families of various ethnic backgrounds.

Transfection of Notch Ternary Complex components into HEK293T cells was used as a recapitulation assay to study Notch-mediated transcriptional mechanisms. Gene knockdown was achieved via RNA interference and the effects of protein depletion on esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) proliferation were determined via a colony formation assay and murine xenografts. Western blotting was used to examine expression of INT subunits in EAC cells and evaluate apoptotic proteins upon INT subunit 11 knockdown (INTS11 KD). Gene KD effects were further explored via flow cytometry. RESULTS We identified the INT complex as part of the Notch transcriptional supercomplex.

It is well established that all four Notch genes can act as oncogenes; however, the mechanism by which Notch proteins transform cells remains unknown. Previously, we reported that both nuclear localization and transcriptional activation are required for neoplastic transformation of RKE cells. Furthermore, we identified cyclin D1 as a direct transcriptional target of constitutively active Notch molecules. In an effort to understand the mechanism by which Notch functions in the nucleus, we sought to determine if Notch formed stable complexes using size exclusion chromatography. Herein, we report that the Notch intracellular domain (N(ic)) forms distinct high-molecular-weight complexes in the nuclei of transformed RKE cells. The largest complex is approximately 1.5 MDa and contains both endogenous CSL (for CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag-1) and Mastermind-Like-1 (Maml). N(ic) molecules that do not have the high-affinity binding site for CSL (RAM) retain the ability to associate with CSL in a stable complex through interactions involving Maml. However, Maml does not directly bind to CSL. Furthermore, Maml can rescue Delta RAM transcriptional activity on a CSL-dependent promoter. These results indicate that deletion of the RAM domain does not equate to CSL-independent signaling. Moreover, in SUP-T1 cells, N(ic) exists exclusively in the largest N(ic)-containing complex. SUP-T1 cells are derived from a T-cell leukemia that harbors the t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocation and constitutively express N(ic).

The Notch signalling pathway has a crucial function in determining cell fates in multiple tissues within metazoan organisms. On binding to ligands, the Notch receptor is cleaved proteolytically and releases its intracellular domain (NotchICD). The NotchICD enters the nucleus and acts cooperatively with other factors to stimulate the transcription of target genes. High levels of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation require the formation of a ternary complex consisting of NotchICD, CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless, LAG-1) and a Mastermind family member. However, it is still not clear how the formation of the ternary complex is regulated. Here we show that Nemo-like kinase (NLK) negatively regulates Notch-dependent transcriptional activation by decreasing the formation of this ternary complex. Using a biochemical screen, we identified Notch as a new substrate of NLK. NLK-phosphorylated Notch1ICD is impaired in its ability to form a transcriptionally active ternary complex. Furthermore, knockdown of NLK leads to hyperactivation of Notch signalling and consequently decreases neurogenesis in zebrafish. Our results both define a new function for NLK and reveal a previously unidentified mode of regulation in the Notch signalling pathway."

Thus, our data indicate that NACK is a key component of the Notch transcriptional complex and is an essential regulator of Notch-mediated tumorigenesis and development."

The Suppressor of Hairless protein is the intermediary between Notch activation and expression of all Enhancer of split genes even though individual genes have distinct patterns of expression in imaginal discs. A comparison between the phenotypes produced by Notch, Suppressor of Hairless and Enhancer of split mutations in the wing and thorax indicate that Suppressor of Hairless and Notch requirements are indistinguishable, but that Enhancer of split activity is only essential for a subset of developmental processes involving Notch function. Likewise, the ectopic expression of Enhancer of split proteins does not reproduce all the consequences typical of ectopic Notch activation. We suggest that the Notch pathway bifurcates after the activation of Suppressor of Hairless and that Enhancer of split activity is not required when the consequence of Notch function is the transcriptional activation of downstream genes. Transcriptional activation mediated by Suppressor of Hairless and transcriptional repression mediated by Enhancer of split could provide greater diversity in the response of individual genes to Notch activity."

Together, CSL and ANK create a groove to bind the MAML-1 polypeptide as a kinked, 70 A helix.

The MAML (mastermind-like) proteins are a family of three co-transcriptional regulators that are essential for Notch signaling, a pathway critical for cell fate determination. Though the functions of MAML proteins in normal development remain unresolved, their distinct tissue distributions and differential activities in cooperating with various Notch receptors suggest that they have unique roles. Here we show that mice with a targeted disruption of the Maml1 gene have severe muscular dystrophy. In vitro, Maml1-null embryonic fibroblasts failed to undergo MyoD-induced myogenic differentiation, further suggesting that Maml1 is required for muscle development. Interestingly, overexpression of MAML1 in C2C12 cells dramatically enhanced myotube formation and increased the expression of muscle-specific genes, while RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated MAML1 knockdown abrogated differentiation. Moreover, we determined that MAML1 interacts with MEF2C (myocyte enhancer factor 2C), functioning as its potent co-transcriptional regulator. Surprisingly, however, MAML1's promyogenic effects were completely blocked upon activation of Notch signaling, which was associated with recruitment of MAML1 away from MEF2C to the Notch transcriptional complex. Our study thus reveals novel and nonredundant functions for MAML1: It acts as a coactivator for MEF2C transcription and is essential for proper muscle development. Mechanistically, MAML1 appears to mediate cross-talk between Notch and MEF2 to influence myogenic differentiation."

OBJECTIVE To describe the efficacy and safety of suvorexant for the treatment of insomnia. DATA SOURCES The pivotal registration trials were accessed by querying http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ and http://www.clinicaltrials.gov for the search terms 'suvorexant' and 'MK4305'. Briefing documents from the US Food and Drug Administration Peripheral & Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee and product labelling, provided additional information. STUDY SELECTION All available clinical reports of studies were identified. DATA EXTRACTION Descriptions of the principal results and calculation of number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) for relevant dichotomous outcomes were extracted from the available study reports and other sources of information. DATA SYNTHESIS Suvorexant (MK4305) is the first orexin receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of insomnia. This approval was based in part on a Phase 3 clinical development programme that included two similarly designed, 3-month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies examining suvorexant 40 and 20 mg in non-elderly adults (age < 65 years) and 30 and 15 mg in elderly patients (age \u2265 65 years). Suvorexant was superior to placebo for sleep latency as assessed both objectively by polysomnography and subjectively by patient-estimated sleep latency; suvorexant was also superior to placebo for sleep maintenance, as assessed both objectively by polysomnography and subjectively by patient-estimated total sleep time. NNT vs. placebo for response as measured by a \u2265 6 point improvement on the Insomnia Severity Index at month 3 was 8 (95% CI 6-14) for both the higher and lower dose regimens. The most commonly encountered adverse event (incidence \u2265 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) as identified in product labelling is somnolence, with NNH values vs. placebo of 13 (95% CI 11-18) for suvorexant 40 and 30 mg, and 28 (95% CI 17-82) for suvorexant 20 and 15 mg. The efficacy and tolerability profile of suvorexant is similar for those < 65 and \u2265 65 years of age. Rebound insomnia and withdrawal effects were not observed when suvorexant was discontinued after 3 months or after 12 months of nightly use. Because of concerns about dose-related, next-day effects, including sedation, the recommended dose range is 10-20 mg. CONCLUSIONS Suvorexant appears efficacious and relatively tolerable. Its different mechanism of action and potentially different safety and tolerability profile compared with currently available hypnotics represents a new option for the pharmacological treatment of insomnia."

Suvorexant (Belsomra(R)), a dual orexin receptor antagonist widely used in the treatment of insomnia, inhibits the arousal system in the brain. However, the drug's ventilatory effects have not been fully explored. This study aims to investigate the expression of orexin receptors in respiratory neurons and the effects of suvorexant on ventilation. Immunohistology of brainstem orexin receptor OX2R expression was performed in adult mice (n = 4) in (1) rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG) neurons projecting to the phrenic nucleus (PhN) retrogradely labeled by Fluoro-Gold (FG) tracer, (2) neurons immunoreactive for paired like homeobox 2b (Phox2b) in the parafacial respiratory group/retrotrapezoid nucleus (pFRG/RTN), and (3) neurons immunoreactive for neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) and somatostatin (SST) in the preB\u00f6tzinger complex (preB\u00f6tC). Additionally, we measured in vivo ventilatory responses to hyperoxic hypercapnia (5% CO2) and hypoxia (10% O2) before and after suvorexant pretreatment (10 and cumulative 100 mg/kg) in unrestrained mice (n = 10) in a body plethysmograph. We found the OX2R immunoreactive materials in pFRG/RTN Phox2b and preB\u00f6tC NK1R/SST immunoreactive neurons but not in FG-labeled rVRG neurons, which suggests the involvement of orexin in respiratory control. Further, suvorexant expressly suppressed the hypercapnic ventilatory augmentation, otherwise unaffecting ventilation. Central orexin is involved in shaping the hypercapnic ventilatory chemosensitivity. Suppression of hypercapnic ventilatory augmentation by the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant calls for caution in its use in pathologies that may progress to hypercapnic respiratory failure, or sleep-disordered breathing. Clinical trials are required to explore the role of targeted pharmacological inhibition of orexin in ventilatory pathologies."

Suvorexant (Belsomra\u00ae) is a novel dual orexin receptor antagonist used for the treatment of insomnia. The prevalence of suvorexant in forensic samples is relatively unknown, which demonstrates the need for robust analytical assays for the detection of this sedative hypnotic in forensic toxicology laboratories. In this study, suvorexant was isolated from whole blood using a simple acidic/neutral liquid-liquid extraction followed by analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Matrix effects were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using various extraction solvents, proprietary lipid clean-up devices and source conditions. The method was validated in terms of limit of detection, limit of quantitation, precision, bias, calibration model, carryover, matrix effects and drug interferences. Electrospray is a competitive ionization process whereby compounds in the droplet compete for a limited number of charged sites at the surface. As such, it is capacity-limited, and LC-MS-based techniques must be carefully evaluated to ensure that matrix effects or coeluting drugs do not impact quantitative assay performance. In this report, we describe efforts to ameliorate such effects in the absence of an isotopically labeled internal standard. Matrix effects are highly variable and heavily dependent on the physico-chemical properties of the substance. Although there is no universal solution to their resolution, conditions at the electrospray interface can mitigate these issues. Using this approach, the LC-MS/MS assay was fully validated and limits of detection and quantitation of 0.1 and 0.5 ng/mL suvorexant were achieved in blood."

BACKGROUND Delirium is often treated on a subjective basis and per the discretion of the attending physician because of a lack of pharmacological evidence in the literature. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to examine the efficacy of a hypnotic drug, suvorexant, as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of delirium. METHODS Fifty-seven patients were targeted. Of the 57 patients, 39 were in the subolexant group, 17 in the antipsychotic group, and 1 was taking antidepressants. The Delirium Rating Scale-Revised 98 was used to evaluate the symptoms of delirium before and 3 and 7 days after drug administration. In addition, the medical history, occurrence of adverse effects, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein level of participants were examined. RESULTS Both drugs exhibited therapeutic effects on delirium, but suvorexant had a more pronounced effect. Furthermore, the suvorexant group exhibited decreased levels of C-reactive protein, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. Suvorexant seems to improve the symptoms of inflammation-related delirium without any serious adverse effects, suggesting that it can be explored as a safe treatment option for clinical use in future studies.

STUDY OBJECTIVES Effective pharmacological treatments for sleep disturbance related to trauma with and without co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are needed. There is debate regarding what effects on rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) would be beneficial. Suvorexant is the first dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) approved for the treatment of insomnia. In contrast to most psychotropic agents, DORAs can enhance REMS while reducing arousal. We evaluated 6 weeks of suvorexant treatment for trauma-related insomnia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with clinical and polysomnographic evaluation. METHODS Participants with insomnia that followed a traumatic event were recruited from the community. Representation of current, past-only, and never having met criteria for PTSD was similar and most participants had experienced trauma-related nightmares. Participants were randomly assigned to receive suvorexant or placebo, initially at 10 mg and increased to 20 mg after 1 week, if tolerated. Polysomnography was obtained for screening, at baseline, and at 2 weeks of treatment. RESULTS The thirty-seven evaluable participants had significant improvement of PTSD and insomnia symptoms, however, there were no significant interactions with treatment condition. Medication was well tolerated with only one dropout being related to side effects. Within the suvorexant group increased REM segment duration correlated with concurrent PTSD symptom reduction. Nightmares remitted in all of the participants who received suvorexant and all but one of those receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS A robust placebo response undermined detecting a medication effect. Further evaluation of DORAs for trauma-related insomnia, as well as factors contributing to placebo-response, are warranted."

BACKGROUND Suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist, is known as a safe and effective sleep medication. Many patients with heart failure (HF) have sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and are short sleepers, and it is unknown whether suvorexant is effective in HF patients and can improve insomnia safely. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of suvorexant on SDB in patients with HF. METHODS The Heart Failure with Insomnia and Suvorexant trial of Juntendo University Hospital and Juntendo Shizuoka Hospital (J-FLAVOR trial) is a multicenter trial with a randomized double crossover design. We will enroll a total of 30 HF patients treated in the Juntendo University Hospital and Juntendo Shizuoka Hospital. Eligible patients will undergo portable sleep monitoring twice with or without oral administration of suvorexant in a randomly assigned order. Before the study night, patients in the suvorexant first group will receive suvorexant for 4 consecutive days. There are at least 3 wash-out days between the study nights with and without suvorexant. Primary outcome measures of the non-inferiority trial of suvorexant include the apnea-hypopnea index and the severity of SDB, and the results will be compared between the study nights with and without suvorexant. CONCLUSION The present study can determine whether suvorexant can be used in HF patients without affecting their SDB. This is a pilot study to primarily assess whether suvorexant affects the severity of SDB in patients with HF. Therefore, further study is warranted to investigate whether suvorexant alters short- and long-term clinical outcomes by providing longer and better sleep in patients with HF."

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS In Periods 1-4, overnight sleep parameters were recorded by PSG and next-morning residual effects were assessed by psychomotor performance tests and subjective assessments. Statistically significant sleep-promoting effects were observed with all doses of suvorexant compared to placebo. Suvorexant 50 mg and 100 mg significantly decreased latency to persistent sleep and wake after sleep onset time, and increased sleep efficiency. Suvorexant 10 mg significantly decreased wake after sleep onset time. There were no statistically significant effects of suvorexant on EEG frequency bands including delta (slow wave) activity based on power spectral analysis. Suvorexant was well tolerated. There was no evidence of next-day residual effects for suvorexant 10 mg. Suvorexant 50 mg statistically significantly reduced subjective alertness, and suvorexant 100 mg significantly increased reaction time and reduced subjective alertness. There were no statistically significant effects of any suvorexant dose on digit symbol substitution test performance. In Period 5, plasma samples of suvorexant were collected for pharmacokinetic evaluation. The median T(max) was 3 hours and apparent terminal t(\u00bd) was 9-13 hours.

AIM Serotonin is crucial for proper foetal development, and the placenta has been described as a 'donor' of serotonin for the embryo/foetus. However, in later stages of gestation the foetus produces its own serotonin from maternally-derived tryptophan and placental supply is no longer needed. We propose a novel model of serotonin homeostasis in the term placenta with special focus on the protective role of organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3/SLC22A3). METHODS Dually perfused rat term placenta was employed to quantify serotonin/tryptophan transport and metabolism. Placental membrane vesicles isolated from human term placenta were used to characterize serotonin transporters on both sides of the syncytiotrophoblast. RESULTS We obtained the first evidence that serotonin is massively taken up from the foetal circulation by OCT3. This uptake is concentration-dependent and inhibitable by OCT3 blockers of endogenous (glucocorticoids) or exogenous (pharmaceuticals) origin. Population analyses in rat placenta revealed that foetal sex influences placental extraction of serotonin from foetal circulation. Negligible foetal serotonin levels were detected in maternal-to-foetal serotonin/tryptophan transport and metabolic studies. CONCLUSION We demonstrate that OCT3, localized on the foetus-facing membrane of syncytiotrophoblast, is an essential component of foeto-placental homeostasis of serotonin. Together with serotonin degrading enzyme, monoamine oxidase-A, this offers a protective mechanism against local vasoconstriction effects of serotonin in the placenta. However, this system may be compromised by OCT3 inhibitory molecules, such as glucocorticoids or antidepressants. Our findings open new avenues to explore previously unsuspected/unexplained complications during pregnancy including prenatal glucocorticoid excess and pharmacotherapeutic risks of treating pregnant women with OCT3 inhibitors."

Amphetamine withdrawal increases anxiety and stress sensitivity related to blunted ventral hippocampus (vHipp) and enhances the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) serotonin responses. Extracellular serotonin levels are regulated by the serotonin transporter (SERT) and organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), and vHipp OCT3 expression is enhanced during 24 hours of amphetamine withdrawal, while SERT expression is unaltered. Here, we tested whether OCT3 and SERT expression in the CeA is also affected during acute withdrawal to explain opposing regional alterations in limbic serotonergic neurotransmission and if respective changes continued with two weeks of withdrawal. We also determined whether changes in transporter expression were confined to these regions. Male rats received amphetamine or saline for two weeks followed by 24 hours or two weeks of withdrawal, with transporter expression measured using Western immunoblot. OCT3 and SERT expression increased in the CeA at both withdrawal timepoints. In the vHipp, OCT3 expression increased only at 24 hours of withdrawal, with an equivalent pattern seen in the dorsomedial hypothalamus. No changes were evident in any other regions sampled. These regionally specific changes in limbic OCT3 and SERT expression may partially contribute to the serotonergic imbalance and negative affect during amphetamine withdrawal."

The organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3; synonymous: extraneuronal monoamine transporter, EMT, Slc22a3) encodes an isoform of the organic cation transporters and is expressed widely across the whole brain. OCTs are a family of high-capacity, bidirectional, multispecific transporters of organic cations. These also include serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine making OCTs attractive candidates for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety disorders. OCT3 has been implicated in termination of monoaminergic signalling in the central nervous system. Interestingly, OCT3 mRNA is however also significantly up-regulated in the hippocampus of serotonin transporter knockout mice where it might serve as an alternative reuptake mechanism for serotonin. The examination of the behavioural phenotype of OCT3 knockout mice thus is paramount to assess the role of OCT3. We have therefore subjected mice lacking the OCT3 gene to a comprehensive behavioural test battery. While cognitive functioning in the Morris water maze test and aggression levels measured with the resident-intruder paradigm were in the same range as the respective control animals, OCT3 knockout animals showed a tendency of increased activity and were significantly less anxious in the elevated plus-maze test and the open field test as compared to their respective wild-type controls arguing for a role of OCT3 in the regulation of fear and anxiety, probably by modulating the serotonergic tone in limbic circuitries."

The organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) is a widely expressed transporter for endogenous and exogenous organic cations. Of particular interest is OCT3 expression and function in the brain, where it plays a role in serotonin clearance and influences mood and behavior. Protein kinase signaling mediates rapid modulation of cerebral processes, but little is known about acute regulation of OCT3 by protein kinases. Therefore, we cloned mouse OCT3 (mOCT3) and generated a human embryonic kidney cell line stably expressing the transporter to study transport characteristics, acute regulation by protein kinases, and interaction with psychotropic drugs. Uptake measurement was performed using the fluorescent cation 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP(+), 1 \u03bcM) as a substrate. The translational value of these findings was determined by comparing results obtained with cloned mouse and human OCT3. mOCT3-mediated transport is membrane potential dependent and pH independent. ASP(+) uptake by mOCT3 and human OCT3 (hOCT3) was efficiently inhibited by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, tetrapentylammonium (TPA(+)), corticosterone, serotonin, and histamine and by the drugs ketamine, fluoxetine, and diazepam. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations of mOCT3 and hOCT3 for TPA(+), serotonin, diazepam, and ketamine are significantly different. Diazepam is a non-transported inhibitor. Furthermore, the activities of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are acutely regulated by the p56 (lck) tyrosine kinase by decreasing their V max. Studies with freshly isolated renal proximal tubules from mOCT1/2(-/-) mice, in which mOCT3 is the only OCT present, confirmed this regulation pathway. Only the activity of hOCT3 is regulated by calmodulin. These findings suggest that even though many transport properties of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are similar, there are also species-specific aspects of OCT3 function."

Poorly managed gestational diabetes can lead to severe complications for mother and child including fetal overgrowth, neonatal hypoglycemia and increased autism risk. Use of metformin to control it is relatively new and promising. Yet safety concerns regarding gestational metformin use remain, as its long-term effects in offspring are unclear. In light of beneficial findings with metformin for adult mouse social behavior, we hypothesized gestational metformin treatment might also promote offspring sociability. To test this, metformin was administered to non-diabetic, lean C57BL/6 J female mice at mating, with treatment discontinued at birth or wean. Male offspring exposed to metformin through birth lost social interaction preference relative to controls by time in chambers, but not by sniffing measures. Further, prenatal metformin exposure appeared to enhance social novelty preference only in females. However due to unbalanced litters and lack of statistical power, firm establishment of any sex-dependency of metformin's effects on sociability was not possible. Since organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) transports metformin and is dense in placenta, social preferences of OCT3 knock-out males were measured. Relative to wild-type, OCT3 knock-outs had reduced interaction preference. Our data indicate gestational metformin exposure under non-diabetic conditions, or lack of OCT3, can impair social behavior in male C57BL6/J mice. Since OCT3 transports serotonin and tryptophan, impaired placental OCT3 function is one common mechanism that could persistently impact central serotonin systems and social behavior. Yet no gross alterations in serotonergic function were evident by measure of serotonin transporter density in OCT3, or serotonin turnover in metformin-exposed offspring brains. Mechanisms underlying the behavioral outcomes, and if with gestational diabetes the same would occur, remain unclear. Metformin's impacts on placental transporters and serotonin metabolism or AMPK activity in fetal brain need further investigation to clarify benefits and risks to offspring sociability from use of metformin to treat gestational diabetes."

Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is associated with increased extracellular serotonin (5-HT) in limbic brain regions. The mechanism through which this occurs remains unclear. One way could be via HPA axis-dependent impairment of serotonin transporter (SERT) function, the high-affinity uptake mechanism for 5-HT. Consistent with this idea, we found that 5-HT clearance rate in hippocampus was dramatically reduced in mice exposed to repeated swim, a stimulus known to activate the HPA axis. However, this phenomenon also occurred in mice lacking SERT, ruling out SERT as a mechanism. The organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) is emerging as an important regulator of brain 5-HT. Moreover, corticosterone, which is released upon HPA axis activation, blocks 5-HT uptake by OCT3. Repeated swim produced a persistent elevation in plasma corticosterone, and, consistent with prolonged blockade by corticosterone, we found that OCT3 expression and function were reduced in these mice. Importantly, this effect of repeated swim to reduce 5-HT clearance rate was corticosterone dependent, as evidenced by its absence in adrenalectomized mice, in which plasma corticosterone levels were essentially undetectable. Behaviorally, mice subjected to repeated swim spent less time immobile in the tail suspension test than control mice, but responded similarly to SERT- and norepinephrine transporter-selective antidepressants. Together, these results show that reduced 5-HT clearance following HPA axis activation is likely mediated, at least in part, by the corticosterone-sensitive OCT3, and that drugs developed to selectively target OCT3 (unlike corticosterone) may be candidates for the development of novel antidepressant medications."

Depression is a prevalent condition affecting up to 20% of pregnant women. Hence, more than 10% are prescribed antidepressant drugs, mainly serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). We hypothesize that antidepressants disturb serotonin homeostasis in the fetoplacental unit by inhibiting serotonin transporter (SERT) and organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) in the maternal- and fetal-facing placental membranes, respectively. Paroxetine, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, and venlafaxine were tested in situ (rat term placenta perfusion) and ex vivo (uptake studies in membrane vesicles isolated from healthy human term placenta). All tested antidepressants significantly inhibited SERT- and OCT3-mediated serotonin uptake in a dose-dependent manner. Calculated half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were in the range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Using in vitro and in situ models, we further showed that the placental efflux transporters did not compromise mother-to-fetus transport of antidepressants. Collectively, we suggest that antidepressants have the potential to affect serotonin levels in the placenta or fetus when administered at therapeutic doses. Interestingly, the effect of antidepressants on serotonin homeostasis in rat placenta was sex dependent. As accurate fetal programming requires optimal serotonin levels in the fetoplacental unit throughout gestation, inhibition of SERT-/OCT3-mediated serotonin uptake may help explain the poor outcomes of antidepressant use in pregnancy."

BACKGROUND Three primary monoamines-serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine-play major roles in the placenta-fetal brain axis. Analogously to the brain, the placenta has transport mechanisms that actively take up these monoamines into trophoblast cells. These transporters are known to play important roles in the differentiated syncytiotrophoblast layer, but their status and activities in the undifferentiated, progenitor cytotrophoblast cells are not well understood. Thus, we have explored the cellular handling and regulation of monoamine transporters during the phenotypic transitioning of cytotrophoblasts along the villous pathway. METHODS Experiments were conducted with two cellular models of syncytium development: primary trophoblast cells isolated from the human term placenta (PHT), and the choriocarcinoma-derived BeWo cell line. The gene and protein expression of membrane transporters for serotonin (SERT), norepinephrine (NET), dopamine (DAT), and organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) was determined by quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Subsequently, the effect of trophoblast differentiation on transporter activity was analyzed by monoamine uptake into cells. RESULTS We present multiple lines of evidence of changes in the transcriptional and functional regulation of monoamine transporters associated with trophoblast differentiation. These include enhancement of SERT and DAT gene and protein expression in BeWo cells. On the other hand, in PHT cells we report negative modulation of SERT, NET, and OCT3 protein expression. We show that OCT3 is the dominant monoamine transporter in PHT cells, and its main functional impact is on serotonin uptake, while passive transport strongly contributes to norepinephrine and dopamine uptake. Further, we show that a wide range of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors affect serotonin cellular accumulation, at pharmacologically relevant drug concentrations, via their action on both OCT3 and SERT. Finally, we demonstrate that BeWo cells do not well reflect the molecular mechanisms and properties of healthy human trophoblast cells. CONCLUSIONS Collectively, our findings provide insights into the regulation of monoamine transport during trophoblast differentiation and present important considerations regarding appropriate in vitro models for studying monoamine regulation in the placenta."

Somatostatin (SST) exhibits a wide range of physiological functions, including the regulation of tumor cell growth. Octreotide (OCT) is a synthetic analogue of SST that can be used to slow gastrointestinal bleeding, inhibit the release of growth hormone and impede gastrointestinal tumor growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of OCT underlying the inhibition of gastric cancer cell proliferation. Proteins of interest were detected using western blotting, and the zinc finger protein (ZAC)-P300 complex was quantified using co-immunoprecipitation. P300-histone acetyltransferase (P300-HAT) activity was determined spectrophotometrically. The results showed that OCT decreased the phosphorylation of Akt which caused the level of ZAC to increase. In turn, the interaction between ZAC and P300 increased the activity of P300-HAT; ultimately, the phosphorylation of serine 10 in histone H3 (pS10-H3) was decreased and the acetylation of lysine 14 in histone H3 (acK14-H3) was increased. These results suggest that OCT attenuates SGC-7901 cell proliferation by enhancing P300-HAT activity through the interaction of ZAC and P300, causing a reduction in pS10-H3 and an increase in acK14-H3.

Cell migration is essential throughout embryonic and adult life. In numerous cell systems, the small GTPase Rac is required for lamellipodia formation at the leading edge and movement ability. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to Rac activation during migration are still unclear. Recently, a mammalian superfamily of proteins related to the prototype member Dock180 has been identified with homologues in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we addressed the role of Dock180 and ELMO1 proteins, which function as a complex to mediate Rac activation, in mammalian cell migration. Using mutants of Dock180 and ELMO1 in a Transwell assay as well as transgenic rescue of a C. elegans mutant lacking CED-5 (Dock180 homologue), we identified specific regions of Dock180 and ELMO1 required for migration in vitro and in a whole animal model. In both systems, the Dock180.ELMO1 complex formation and the ability to activate Rac were required. We also found that ELMO1 regulated multiple Dock180 superfamily members to promote migration. Interestingly, deletion mutants of ELMO1 missing their first 531 or first 330 amino acids that can still bind and cooperate with Dock180 in Rac activation failed to promote migration, which correlated with the inability to localize to lamellipodia. This finding suggests that Rac activation by the ELMO.Dock180 complex at discrete intracellular locations mediated by the N-terminal 330 amino acids of ELMO1 rather than generalized Rac activation plays a role in cell migration."

As ELMO1 promotes cytoskeletal reorganization during engulfment, we hypothesized that ELMO1 loss would worsen inflammatory arthritis. Surprisingly, Elmo1-deficient mice showed reduced joint inflammation in acute and chronic arthritis models. Genetic and cell-biology studies revealed that ELMO1 associates with receptors linked to neutrophil function in arthritis and regulates activation and early neutrophil recruitment to the joints, without general inhibition of inflammatory responses. Further, neutrophils from the peripheral blood of human donors that carry the SNP in ELMO1 associated with arthritis display increased migratory capacity, whereas ELMO1 knockdown reduces human neutrophil migration to chemokines linked to arthritis.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS Mucosal healing is an emerging therapeutic goal that could result in clinical remission of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. We sought to determine the role of engulfment and cell motility protein 1 [ELMO1] in wound healing in vitro and in vivo and to investigate the underlying pathways. METHODS RNA transcriptome sequencing was performed to detect the expression profiles of mRNA between inflamed tissues and corresponding non-inflamed tissues of IBD patients, followed by Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] datasets and western blot analysis. The effects of ELMO1 overexpression or knockdown on cell migration and proliferation were determined. The dependence of these effects on Rac1 was assessed using a Rac1 inhibitor [NSC23766] and a Rac1 pull-down assay. We identified the underlying pathways involved by Gene Ontology [GO] analysis. A dextran sulphate sodium [DSS]-induced colitis model was established to evaluate the role of ELMO1 in colonic mucosal healing. RESULTS ELMO1 was upregulated in inflamed tissues compared with corresponding non-inflamed tissues. ELMO1 overexpression increased cell migration in a Rac1-dependent manner. Depletion of ELMO1, or NSC23766 administration, abolished this effect. GO analysis revealed that ELMO1 overexpression preferentially affected pathways involved in cytoskeletal regulation and wound healing, which was demonstrated by enhanced F-actin staining and increased numbers of extending lamellipodia in cells overexpressing ELMO1. In DSS-induced colitis, systemic delivery of pSin-EF2-ELMO1-Pur attenuated colonic inflammation and promoted recovery from colonic injury. The protective effect of ELMO1 was dependent on Rac1 activation. CONCLUSIONS ELMO1 protects against DSS-induced colonic injury in mice through its effect on epithelial migration via Rac1 activation."

BACKGROUND The complex of Dock180/ELMO1 that functions as a bipartite guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac is essential for diverse physiological and pathological processes of cells such as cell migration, phagocytosis, and invasion of cancer cells. Among the Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), it has been reported that Hck directly phosphorylates ELMO1, regulating phagocytosis by promoting activation of Rac1; however, the involvement of other SFKs in ELMO1 phosphorylation has remained unknown. Here, we identified novel tyrosine (Y) residues of ELMO1 phosphorylated by SFKs, and examined the effects on Rac1 activity, cell adhesion, spreading, and cell motility on extracellular matrix (ECM). RESULTS In this study, we unveiled that Src and Fyn can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ELMO1 in in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation assays. Mutational analyses identified both Y720 and Y724 residues of ELMO1 as Src-mediated phosphorylation sites, preferentially on Y724. Single substitution of Y724 to Phe abrogated Rac1 activation triggered by Src. To elucidate the biological function of pY724, we established NIH3T3 cells stably expressing wild-type ELMO1 or its Y724F mutant together with Dock180. Among them, Y724-deficient cells exhibited a depletion of Rac1 activity with diminished phosphorylation of ELMO1 even upon the ECM-stimulation. It is noteworthy that NIH3T3 cells with ELMO1 Y724F were strikingly defective to promote cell spreading on fibronectin-coated dish, concomitantly exhibiting immature assemblies of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Eventually, ELMO1 Y724F significantly impaired cell migration. CONCLUSION These results define that Src-mediated Y724 phosphorylation in ELMO1 plays a critical role for cell spreading via activation of Rac1, leading to promotion of cell migration. As the overexpression and/or hyperactivation of Src have been shown in a wide variety of human cancers, Src-mediated phosphorylation of Y724 in ELMO1 may regulate cancer cell adhesion to the ECM, invasion into surrounding tissues, and subsequent distant metastasis."

The SH3 and SH2 domains of hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck) play important roles in substrate targeting. To identify new components of Hck signaling pathways, we identified proteins that bind to the SH3 domain of Hck (Scott et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 28238). One such protein was ELMO1, the mammalian orthologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans gene, ced-12. ELMO1 is an approximately 80-kD protein containing a PH domain and a C-terminal Pro-rich sequence. In C. elegans, ced-12 is required for the engulfment of dying cells and for cell migration. In mammalian fibroblasts, ELMO1 binds to Dock180, and functions upstream of Rac during phagocytosis and cell migration. We previously showed that ELMO1 binds directly to the Hck SH3 domain and is phosphorylated by Hck. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to identify the following sites of ELMO1 phosphorylation: Tyr 18, Tyr 216, Tyr 511, Tyr 395, and Tyr 720. Mutant forms of ELMO1 lacking these sites were defective in their ability to promote phagocytosis and migration in fibroblasts. Single tyrosine mutations showed that Tyr 511 is particularly important in mediating these biological effects. These mutants displayed comparable binding to Dock180 and Crk as wild-type ELMO1, but gave a lowered activation of Rac. The data suggest that Src family kinase mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ELMO1 might represent an important regulatory mechanism that controls signaling through the ELMO1/Crk/Dock180 pathway."

In T lymphocytes, Dock2 is essential for CCR7- and CXCR4-dependent Rac activation and chemotaxis, but the role of Elmo proteins in regulating Dock2 function in primary T cells is not known. In this article, we show that endogenous Elmo1, but not Elmo2, interacts constitutively with Dock2 in mouse and human primary T cells. CD4(+) T cells from Elmo1(-/-) mice were profoundly impaired in polarization, Rac activation, and chemotaxis in response to CCR7 and CXCR4 stimulation. Transfection of full-length Elmo1, but not Elmo2 or a Dock2-binding mutant of Elmo1, rescued defective migration of Elmo1(-/-) T cells. Interestingly, Dock2 protein levels were reduced by 4-fold in Elmo1(-/-) lymphocytes despite normal levels of Dock2 mRNA. Dock2 polyubiquitination was increased in Elmo1(-/-) T cells, and treatment with proteasome inhibitors partially restored Dock2 levels in Elmo1(-/-) T cells. Finally, we show that Dock2 is directly ubiquitinated in CD4(+) T cells and that Elmo1 expression in heterologous cells inhibits ubiquitination of Dock2. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unknown, nonredundant role for Elmo1 in controlling Dock2 levels and Dock2-dependent T cell migration in primary lymphocytes. Inhibition of Dock2 has therapeutic potential as a means to control recruitment of pathogenic lymphocytes in diseased tissues.

Introduction: Vancomycin remains the reference antibiotic in neonates for care-related infections caused by \u00df-lactam-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Achieving the optimal serum vancomycin level is challenging because of high inter-individual variability and the drug's narrow therapeutic window. Continuous infusion might offer pharmacokinetic and practical advantages, but we lack consensus on the dosing regimen. The aim was to determine the proportion of neonates achieving an optimal therapeutic vancomycin level at the first vancomycin concentration assay and which dosing regimen is the most suitable for neonates. Methods: All neonates receiving continuous-infusion vancomycin (loading dose 15 mg/kg and maintenance dose 30 mg/kg/d) in a neonatal intensive care unit were retrospectively analyzed. The proportion of neonates reaching the target serum vancomycin level was calculated. After reviewing the literature to identify all published articles proposing a dosing regimen for continuous-infusion vancomycin for neonates, regimens were theoretically applied to our population by using maintenance doses according to covariate(s) proposed in the original publication. Results: Between January 2013 and December 2014, 75 neonates received 91 vancomycin courses by continuous infusion. Median gestational age, birth weight, and postnatal age were 27 weeks (interquartile range 26-30.5), 815 g (685-1,240), and 15 days (9-33). At the first assay, only 28/91 (30.8%) courses resulted in vancomycin levels between 20 and 30 mg/L (target level), 23/91 (25.3%) >30 mg/L and 40/91 (43.9%) <20 mg/L. We applied six published dosing regimens to our patients. One of these dosing regimens based on corrected gestational age (CGA) and serum creatinine level (SCR) would have allowed us to prescribe lower doses to neonates with high vancomycin levels and higher doses to neonates with low levels. Conclusions: A simplified dosing regimen of continuous-infusion vancomycin did not achieve therapeutic ranges in neonates; a patient-tailored dosing regimen taking into account CGA and SCR level or an individualized pharmacokinetic model can help to anticipate the inter-individual variability in neonates and would have been more suitable."

Compared with the general neonatal population, VLBW neonates are less likely to achieve the vancomycin therapeutic targets. Current dosing recommendations are based on studies of the general neonatal population, as only a very limited number of studies have evaluated vancomycin pharmacokinetics in VLBW neonates. The main aim of this study was to develop a vancomycin population pharmacokinetic model to optimize vancomycin dosing in VLBW neonates. Methods This multicenter study was conducted at six major hospitals in Saudi Arabia. The study included VLBW neonates who received vancomycin and had at least one vancomycin serum trough concentration measurement at a steady state. We developed a pharmacokinetic model and performed Monte Carlo simulations to develop an optimized dosing regimen for VLBW infants. We evaluated two different targets: AUC0-24 of 400-600 or 400-800 \u00b5g. h/mL. We also estimated the probability of trough concentrations >15 and 20 \u00b5g/mL. Results In total, we included 236 neonates, 162 in the training dataset, and 74 in the validation dataset. A one-compartment model was used, and the distribution volume was significantly associated only with weight, whereas clearance was significantly associated with weight, postmenstrual age (PMA), and serum creatinine (Scr). Discussion We developed dosing regimens for VLBW neonates, considering the probability of achieving vancomycin therapeutic targets, as well as different toxicity thresholds. The dosing regimens were classified according to PMA and Scr. These dosing regimens can be used to optimize the initial dose of vancomycin in VLBW neonates."

BACKGROUND Vancomycin is used for treating coagulase-negative staphylococcus infections in neonates. However, concerns about the appropriate empirical dosing required for optimal efficacy, still remain. AIM To assess the relationship between the initial doses of vancomycin used in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) with the possibility of achieving therapeutic target of AUC024h/MIC > 400 \u00b5g/h/mL. METHODS Retrospective and descriptive study carried out between February 2016 and March 2018. All neonates treated with vancomycin for suspected/proven Gram-positive infection and with at least one trough serum concentration level were included. Probability of target attainment (PTA) was evaluated through resampling of AUC and MIC values. RESULTS Final dataset included 38 patients and 49 trough vancomycin levels; 94.7% of these cases (n = 36) were confirmed Gram-positive infections. The median AUC/MIC values for the trough values vancomycin < 10 \u00b5g/mL group and for the \u2265 10 \u00b5g/mL group were 327 (IQR 174-395) and 494 (IQR 318-631) respectively (p = 0.035).

BACKGROUND Continuous infusions of vancomycin over 24 hours have been shown in adults to reduce drug toxicity, lower treatment costs and require fewer blood samples for therapeutic drug monitoring. They may also improve clinical outcome through earlier attainment of target drug concentrations. In neonates, there is no consensus on vancomycin dosing. We reviewed the literature to assess the evidence for vancomycin dosing regimens for continuous infusion in neonates. METHODS Medline and Embase were searched for studies about continuous vancomycin dosing regimens in neonates that reported serum drug concentrations. The search identified 469 articles, of which 5 were relevant. RESULTS Five prospective studies were included; 2 studies used non-linear mixed effects modeling. Vancomycin was administered with parenteral nutrition or 5% dextrose. Target serum concentrations varied (range: 10-30 mg/L). Four studies used loading doses before continuous infusion; only 1 documented achievement of therapeutic concentrations after the load. The time to a therapeutic concentration was not reported for the other studies. Attainment of target concentrations ranged from 56% to 89% of measurements. Only 1 study compared intermittent to continuous infusions, reporting higher attainment of target concentrations with continuous dosing (82% vs. 46%). No adverse effects were reported, although 3 neonates developed a reversible raised serum creatinine in the setting of septicemia. CONCLUSION Continuous infusions of vancomycin in neonates are well tolerated, require less blood sampling and may result in improved attainment of target concentrations. Further prospective studies are needed in this population."

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT *Effects of size, renal function, age (postnatal age, gestational age and postmenstrual age) as predictors of vancomycin clearance in premature neonates are established, but the relative contribution of each component remains poorly quantified, largely because these variables are closely correlated. *We have quantified the covariates contributing to vancomycin clearance population parameter variability in order to establish the major covariates required for dosing predictions. Size, standardized using allometric models, was the primary covariate used in our analysis. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS *Size explained 49.8%, postmenstrual age 18.2% and renal function 14.1% of clearance variability. *Descriptors of the relationship between age and clearance in premature neonates vary. *The use of a variable slope sigmoidal model to describe the relationship between clearance and postmenstrual age predicted an adult clearance of 3.79 l h(-1) 70 kg(-1) (95% confidence interval 2.76, 4.98) from premature neonatal data. AIM To identify and quantify factors describing the variability of vancomycin clearance in premature neonates. METHODS Population pharmacokinetics were estimated (NONMEM) in 214 neonates [postmenstrual age (PMA) 30.4 weeks, range 24-34 weeks; postnatal age 11.9 days, range 1-27 days; weight 1.30 kg, range 0.42-2.6 kg] using therapeutic drug monitoring data. Covariate analysis included weight, PMA, serum creatinine, use of inotropes or ibuprofen, positive blood culture and respiratory support. A one-compartment linear disposition model with zero order input and first-order elimination was used to describe the data (604 observations). RESULTS The population estimate for volume of distribution (V) was 39 l 70 kg(-1) (coefficient of variation 19.4%). Clearance (CL) increased from 0.897 l h(-1) 70 kg(-1) at 24 weeks PMA to 2.02 l h(-1) 70 kg(-1) by 34 weeks PMA. The between-subject variability for CL was 18.6% and the between-occasion variability was 12.2%. The use of ibuprofen reduced clearance, but this effect was attributable to reduced renal function. Overall, 82% of the variability of CL was predictable. Size explained 49.8%, PMA 18.2% and renal function 14.1%. The use of a variable slope sigmoidal model to describe the relationship between clearance and PMA predicted an adult clearance of 3.79 l h(-1) 70 kg(-1) (95% confidence interval 2.76, 4.98). CONCLUSIONS Size, renal function and PMA are the major contributors to clearance variability in premature neonates. The small (18%) unexplained variability in clearance suggests target concentration intervention is unnecessary if size, age and renal function are used to predict the dose. Extrapolation to an adult clearance from neonatal data is possible using allometric size models and a function describing clearance maturation."

OBJECTIVE Because pharmacokinetic data are limited, continuous infusions of vancomycin in neonates are administered using different dosing regimens. The aim of this work was to evaluate the results of vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) under three different dosing regimens and to optimise vancomycin therapy. METHODS Vancomycin TDM concentrations were noted and compared prospectively in three hospitals. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to optimise dosing using NONMEM software. Patient-tailored optimised dosing regimens were evaluated in a prospective study. RESULTS Two hundred and seven serum vancomycin concentrations from 116 neonates were analysed. Only 48 neonates (41%) had serum vancomycin concentrations within the therapeutic range of 15-25 mg/l using a current dosing regimen. Concentrations ranged from 5.1 to 61.5 mg/l. Loading doses were required to decrease the risk of sub-therapeutic levels during early treatment. An optimised dosing regimen, taking into account birth weight, current weight, postnatal age and serum creatinine, was developed based on a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. A prospective validation study in 58 neonates demonstrated a higher percentage of neonates (70.7%, n=41) reaching the therapeutic range and early dosage adaptation (6-12 h post-dose) using an optimised dosing regimen.

BACKGROUND Vancomycin is commonly used to treat methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections in neonates. Consensus on its ideal dosing in neonates has not been achieved. Model-based dosing recently has evolved as an important tool to optimize vancomycin initial dosing. The aim of this is to evaluate a population pharmacokinetic model-based approach in achieving the vancomycin therapeutic target of an AUC0-24 400 as recommended by the recent IDSA treatment guidelines. This model was implemented as a simple Excel calculator to individualize and optimize vancomycin initial dosing in neonates. METHODS An Excel calculator was developed using a previously published population pharmacokinetic model in neonates. It was evaluated using retrospectively retrieved data. For each patient, the initial empiric dose was calculated using the proposed Excel model and the most widely used neonatal dosing references. The probability of achieving the target AUC0-24 of >400 mg h/L using the model-based method was calculated and compared with that of the empiric doses using other references. RESULTS This analysis included 225 neonates. The probability of achieving the target AUC0-24 >400 was 89% using our model-based approach compared with 11%-59% using tertiary neonatal dosing references (p < 0.01 for all comparisons).

The antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) has been implicated as a human teratogen causing spina bifida aperta. Recently we developed a mouse model inducing spina bifida aperta and occulta with VPA. In a search for novel antiepileptic agents the VPA metabolite E-2-n-propyl-2-pentenoic acid (2-en-VPA) had been developed. In the mouse, 2-en-VPA exhibits anticonvulsive potency similar to VPA but very low teratogenic potency (induction of exencephaly). We have now compared VPA and its metabolite 2-en-VPA in regard to induction of spina bifida in our mouse model. 2-en-VPA was administered 3 times during the period of gestation most sensitive for the induction of spina bifida aperta with VPA: on day 9 of gestation at 0, 6 and 12 h. The following doses were injected (in mmol 2-en-VPA-Na/kg): (a) 3 x 2.1, (b) 3 x 2.7 (the equimolar dose of VPA is the threshold dose for induction of spina bifida aperta) and (c) 3 x 3.0 (the equimolar VPA dose produced spina bifida aperta). 2-en-VPA did not induce spina bifida aperta in the mouse in any of these groups. We then investigated the induction of spina bifida occulta in the three dose groups. Spina bifida occulta is a less serious form of spina bifida and may provide a sensitive method to estimate the potency of a compound to induce more severe forms of spina bifida.

Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) has been associated with the formation of spina bifida aperta, meningocele, and meningomyelocele in the human. Until now, a direct relationship between VPA application and spina bifida has not been experimentally demonstrated. VPA was known only to induce exencephaly in mice, a defect of the anterior neural tube. Maximal sensitivity toward production of this defect was on day 8 of gestation (plug day = day 0). The closure of the posterior neuropore occurs later in the development of mice than the closure of the anterior neuropore. To investigate whether there is a direct relationship between VPA application during pregnancy and induction of spina bifida in mice, we administered various doses of the drug on day 9 of gestation, at three time intervals (at 0, 6, and 12 hr). This administration of VPA produced spina bifida aperta and spina bifida occulta in mice. High doses of VPA (3 x 450 and 3 x 500 mg/kg) induced a low rate of spina bifida aperta in the lumbosacral region. High incidences of spina bifida occulta, a less serious form of spina bifida, were induced with lower doses. This malformation was demonstrated in double-stained fetal skeletons by measurements of the distance between the cartilaginous ends of each vertebral arch. The occurrence of this defect and its localization was dose-dependent. The lumbar region was affected by all doses investigated (3 x 300, 3 x 350, 3 x 400, 3 x 450, and 3 x 500 mg/kg). The sacral/coccygeal region was affected additionally, but with higher doses (3 x 400, 3 x 450, and 3 x 500 mg/kg). A comparison of the results obtained with day 16 and 17 control fetuses showed that the pattern of gaps present in the lumbar and sacral region of the spinal cord in treated groups was drug-specific and not related to a developmental delay. Our results indicate that multiple administrations of VPA on day 9 of gestation in mice result in a low incidence of spina bifida aperta and a high incidence of spina bifida occulta, and provides a relevant model for the study of human spina bifida defects."

Splitting birth defects into dysmorphologically homogeneous groups might improve the ability to detect a genetic risk factor or teratogenic exposure. With regard to spina bifida, recent studies suggest that etiologic heterogeneity exists within the group of spina bifida, although exogenous risk factors have been sparsely evaluated for subgroups. In the present study, 210 spina bifida patients were classified into relatively homogeneous groups, based on retrospective information on appearance and functional aspects of the lesion abstracted from medical records of the patients. We compared high with low spina bifida, and open with closed spina bifida, and investigated whether risk factors for spina bifida such as maternal age, antiepileptic drug use, parental occupation, and genetic factors were specifically associated with these homogeneous subclasses. For these comparisons, a referent group of 671 children was used. Although classifying spina bifida into homogeneous subclasses presented some difficulties and numbers were small, this study provides some evidence for different risk profiles for subclasses of spina bifida. The sex ratio, the proportion of miscarriages of siblings, and maternal age did not differ among the different subclasses of spina bifida. However, children with a positive family history of neural tube defects (NTDs) had a higher risk of high spina bifida [odds ratio (OR) = 6.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7-19.2] than of low spina bifida (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.0-4.2). Siblings with NTDs were more common in cases with high spina bifida and cases with open spina bifida. A strongly increased risk of high spina bifida was found for male welders (OR = 12.1, 95% CI: 1.5-64.2), whereas the risk of low spina bifida was much lower (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 0.2-7.9). For mothers with agricultural occupations, a strongly increased risk was observed for open spina bifida (OR = 14.3, 95% CI: 2.9-77.7), whereas none of 107 cases with closed spina bifida had a mother with an occupation in agriculture.

PURPOSE Women with child wish are advised to take folic acid supplements to reduce the risk for spina bifida. However, there is less evidence for this protective effect in women using valproic acid (VPA). We investigated the effect of folic acid in women exposed to VPA in the first trimester of pregnancy. METHODS A case-control study was performed with data from a population-based registry of congenital malformations. Our cases were spina bifida registrations and all other malformed registrations (excluding folic acid sensitive malformations) were used as controls. RESULTS The ORs for the effect of correct folic acid use were calculated among antiepileptic drug (AED) unexposed pregnancies 0.5 [95%CI: 0.3-0.7] and among VPA exposed pregnancies 1.0 [95%CI: 0.1-7.6]. DISCUSSION Due to power-reasons, we cannot conclude that folic acid has no effect on the risk for spina bifida among VPA exposed pregnancies. Although for AED unexposed pregnancies we found a decreased risk. Results from (animal) studies support a biologically plausible association between VPA, folic acid and spina bifida. While folic acid might not be able to reduce the risk for lower spina bifida lesions caused by VPA, the use of folic acid might be important to reduce the risk for higher, folic acid sensitive spina bifida lesions. Further research is needed to get more insight in the most effective form and dose of FA in women that use VPA to reduce the risk for (higher forms of) spina bifida."

Maternal factors significantly associated with increased risk for an NTD were a primary school education or lower (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 4.97); a history of a previous birth defect-affected pregnancy (adjusted OR 5.27, 95% CI 0.98, 28.37); history of a fever or 'cold' (adjusted OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.68, 6.72); use of analgesic and antipyretic drugs (adjusted OR 4.89, 95% CI 0.92, 25.97); daily passive exposure to cigarette smoke (adjusted OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.94, 2.73); poor ventilation during heating (adjusted OR 3.91, 95% CI 0.75, 20.81); and consumption of >or= six meals per week containing pickled vegetables (adjusted OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.11, 13.47) during pregnancy. Factors which appeared to be protective were meat consumption one to three times per week (adjusted OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.37, 1.06), or >or= four times per week (adjusted OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11, 0.77); and legume consumption >or= six times per week (adjusted OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17, 0.89). Differences in risk were found between the two most common phenotypes, anencephaly and spina bifida. Most of the environmental factors had stronger positive and negative associations with risk for anencephaly rather than spina bifida, whereas history of a previous birth defect-associated pregnancy, as well as legume consumption, were more strongly associated with the risk for spina bifida than for anencephaly. The findings suggest that aetiological heterogeneity may exist between anencephaly and spina bifida."

The antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) has been implicated as a human teratogen causing spina bifida aperta. Recently, we developed a mouse model inducing spina bifida aperta with VPA. To elucidate the pathogenesis of VPA-induced spina bifida aperta we now investigated the anatomy and histology of this defect in the mouse. The morphology of spina bifida aperta induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) was used for comparison. Various doses of VPA and RA were administered at different times to determine the periods of sensitivity for inducing spina bifida aperta with these drugs. Each administration regimen consisted of three doses applied at intervals of 6 hr. RA induced spina bifida aperta during an earlier developmental period (day 8 of gestation) than VPA (day 9 of gestation). The most effective regimens for induction of spina bifida aperta in mice were injections of 3 x 500 mg VPA-Na/kg body weight (b.w.) intraperitoneally on day 9 of gestation at 0, 6, and 12 hr; RA (12.5 mg/kg b.w.) was given orally on day 8 of gestation at 12 and 18 hr, day 9 at 0 hr. VPA did not induce spina bifida aperta on day 8 of gestation and RA did not induce this effect on day 9 of gestation. Histological studies of day 18 fetuses carrying spina bifida aperta were performed. The spina bifida aperta induced by VPA shows a disorganized and necrotic spinal cord. In the vertebral canal were observed cell debris, blood cells, capillaries, macrophages, and rests of meninges. These results indicate that the spinal cord is almost destroyed at the affected section. In contrast, the spina bifida aperta induced by RA demonstrates a spinal cord organized in the gray and white matter, the dorsal and ventral horn. But the neural canal does not exist, only a layer of ependymal cells lies on the surface of the spinal cord. Our results indicate that the morphology of spina bifida aperta induced by VPA differed distinctly from that induced by RA in the mouse fetus. Moreover VPA produced a spina bifida aperta with a specific morphology. Also the period of sensitivity for induction of this lesion differed and occurred earlier for RA than for VPA. VPA and RA may possibly induce spina bifida aperta via different mechanisms in the mouse."

Use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations. Spina bifida aperta has been linked specifically to valproic acid (VPA) (estimated risk, 1 to 2%). The actual risk, the exclusive association of VPA with spina bifida and not anencephaly, and the precise causative relation remain matters of discussion. A prospective cohort study of pregnant women with epilepsy receiving AEDs and referred for prenatal diagnosis before week 22 of gestation was conducted, with follow-up to 3 months after birth. Pregnancies (291 singleton and 6 twin) in 261 women were evaluated. The prevalence of anomalies after exposure to any AED was 6.9%. For fetuses exposed to VPA, the prevalence was 9.4%, including six cases of spina bifida, two of which were in monozygotic twins (giving a prevalence rate of 6.3%, or 5.4%, if twins counted as one). Spina bifida was associated with a significantly higher average daily dose of VPA as compared with pregnancies with normal outcome (1.640 +/- 136 mg/d vs 941 +/- 48 mg/d, p = 0.0001). No relation was observed between the occurrence of spina bifida and type of maternal seizure or epilepsy, family history of epilepsy or neural-tube defects, or medical history. From these results we suggest that when the use of VPA during pregnancy cannot be avoided, the teratogenic risk might be diminished by reduction of the daily dose."

On day 9 of gestation, rats were treated with either 0.3 ml physiologic saline or 600 mg/kg valproic acid (VA) given once in the morning and once in the evening (7 h between doses) for a total of 1200 mg/kg. For the teratological investigations, fetuses were examined at 21 days of gestation. Spina bifida occulta was demonstrated in double-stained fetal skeletons by measuring the distance between the, cartilaginous ends of each vertebral arch. The most important finding was the very high rate of spina bifida occulta observed with this application regimen. Spina bifida aperta was not observed in our study. A low rate of exencephaly was observed in the treated group (3%). The difference between the control and treated groups was statistically highly significant from the first thoracic to fifth sacral level. The effects of VA are most pronounced from thoracic 9 to the upper lumbar region. The largest gap in vertebral arches was found in the first and second lumbar vertebrae in the VA-treated group. These findings suggest that the peak concentration of VA in the maternal plasma and high bolus administration of VA may be more important for spina bifida occulta than the total dose and infusion of VA."

Children with Down syndrome (DS) exhibit higher overweight/obesity rates than their typically developing peers. Apelin-12 is a bioactive adipokine that exerts vital roles in obesity-related cardiometabolic comorbidities. To date, apelin-12 has not been investigated in obese-DS. This study aimed to explore the possible association between serum apelin-12 and obesity-related markers and to evaluate the efficiency of apelin-12 in the prediction of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in obese-DS compared to BMI Z-score matched obese-control. The cross-sectional study included 150 prepubertal children classified into three groups; obese-DS (n = 50), obese-control (n = 50), and normal-weight-control (n = 50). Anthropometric parameters, body adiposity, fasting serum levels of blood glucose (FBG), insulin, lipid profile, and apelin-12 were evaluated. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated from FBG and insulin. MetS was defined using Adult Treatment Panel III criteria modified for the pediatric age group. ROC curves were analyzed to evaluate the efficiency of apelin-12 in predicting MetS in obesity groups. Obese-DS exhibited higher body adiposity with marked central fat distribution, atherogenic lipid profile, and higher HOMA-IR compared to obese-control. Apelin-12 was significantly higher in obese-DS and obese-DS with MetS compared to obese-control and obese-control with MetS respectively (p < 0.001). The increase in apelin-12 with higher obesity grades was pronounced in obese-DS. Apelin-12 strongly correlated with body adiposity, several MetS risk factors, and HOMA-IR in obese-DS. Significantly higher AUC for apelin-12 in the diagnosis of MetS among obese-DS than obese-control (AUC = 0.948 vs. AUC = 0.807; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS The current study supports the crucial role of apelin-12 in obesity-related clinical and biochemical markers and in MetS in obese-DS and obese-control. Serum apelin-12 is a potential diagnostic biomarker for MetS with greater performance in obese-DS than obese-control raising its potential for clinical and therapeutic applications.

NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? Are central autonomic pathways and circumventricular organs involved in apelin-induced inhibition of gut motility? What is the main finding and its importance? Peripherally administered apelin-13 inhibits gastric and colonic motor functions through sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic pathways, which seems to be partly mediated by the apelin receptor in circumventricular organs. ABSTRACT Peripheral administration of apelin-13 has been shown to inhibit gastrointestinal (GI) motility, but the relevant mechanisms are incompletely understood. This study aimed to investigate (i) whether the apelin receptor (APJ) is expressed in circumventricular structures involved in autonomic functions, (ii) whether they are activated by peripherally administered apelin, (iii) the role of autonomic pathways in peripheral exogenous apelin-induced GI dysmotility, and (iv) the changes in apelin levels in the extracellular environment of the brain following its peripheral application. Ninety minutes after apelin-13 administration (300 \u03bcg kg-1 , i.p.), gastric emptying (GE) and colon transit (CT) were measured in rats that underwent parasympathectomy and/or sympathectomy. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were also collected from another group of rats that received apelin-13 or vehicle injection. The immunoreactivities for APJ and c-Fos in circumventricular organs (CVOs) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Compared with vehicle-treated rats, GE and CT were inhibited significantly by apelin-13 treatment, and were completely restored in animals that underwent the combination of parasympathectomy and sympathectomy and sympathectomy alone, respectively. Apelin concentrations were elevated in both plasma and CSF following peripheral administration of apelin-13. APJ expression was detected in area postrema (AP), subfornical organ and organum vasculosum of lamina terminalis, and c-Fos expression was observed in response to apelin injection. Apelin-induced c-Fos expression in AP was partially attenuated by pretreatment with the cholecystokinin-1 receptor antagonist lorglumide, whereas it was completely abolished in vagotomized rats. The present data suggest that APJ in CVOs could indirectly contribute to the inhibitory action of peripheral apelin on GI motor functions."

METHODS To assess apelin expression by using immunohistochemical method compared with bladder tumors and matched paracarcinoma tissues. Subsequently, the correlation of apelin expression with the clinicopathological features of bladder cancer patients was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves method was used to analyze apelin prognostic significance for muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients (including 404 muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients and 28 normal bladder tissues, in TCGA dataset). RESULTS Apelin protein level was overexpressed in bladder tumor tissues compared with paracarcinoma tissues. Furthermore, high apelin expression was associated with high tumor stage (P < 0.05), distant metastasis (P < 0.05), and vascular invasion (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier curve analyses showed that the overexpression of apelin was a potential predictor of overall survival and disease-free survival. CONCLUSION Apelin was upregulated in bladder tumor tissues compared with matched adjacent noncancer tissues, especially in the high tumor stage, distant metastasis, and vascular invasion. What is more, high expression of apelin in muscle-invasive bladder cancer indicates the poor prognosis.

The aim of this study was to explore what roles ER stress and autophagy played in apelin-13-induced hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes in vitro. Treatment of H9c2 cells with apelin-13 (0.001-2 \u03bcmol/L) dose-dependently increased the production of ROS and the expression levels of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4). Knockdown of Nox4 with siRNAs effectively prevented the reduction of GSH/GSSG ratio in apelin-13-treated cells. Furthermore, apelin-13 treatment dose-dependently increased the expression of Bip and CHOP, two ER stress markers, in the cells. Knockdown of APJ or Nox4 with the corresponding siRNAs, or application of NADPH inhibitor DPI blocked apelin-13-induced increases in Bip and CHOP expression. Moreover, apelin-13 treatment increased the formation of autophagosome and ER fragments and the LC3 puncta in the ER of the cells. Knockdown of APJ, Nox4, Bip or CHOP with the corresponding siRNAs, or application of DPI or salubrinal attenuated apelin-13-induced overexpression of LC3-II/I and beclin 1.

Women with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) exhibit better right ventricular (RV) function and survival than men; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), through estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER-\u03b1), attenuates PAH-induced RV failure (RVF) by upregulating the procontractile and prosurvival peptide apelin via a BMPR2-dependent mechanism.

RV cardiomyocyte apelin abundance increased in vivo or in vitro after treatment with E2 or ER-\u03b1 agonist. Studies employing ER-\u03b1-null or ER-\u03b2-null mice, ER-\u03b1 loss-of-function mutant rats, or siRNA demonstrated that ER-\u03b1 is necessary for E2 to upregulate RV apelin. E2 and ER-\u03b1 increased BMPR2 in pulmonary hypertension RVs and in isolated RV cardiomyocytes, associated with ER-\u03b1 binding to the Bmpr2 promoter. BMPR2 is required for E2-mediated increases in apelin abundance, and both BMPR2 and apelin are necessary for E2 to exert RV-protective effects. E2 or ER-\u03b1 agonist rescued monocrotaline pulmonary hypertension and restored RV apelin and BMPR2.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which primarily metabolises angiotensin (Ang) II to generate the beneficial heptapeptide Ang-(1-7), serves as a negative regulator of the RAAS. Apelin is a second catalytic substrate for ACE2 and functions as an inotropic and cardiovascular protective peptide. The physiological effects of Apelin are exerted through binding to its receptor APJ, a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor that shares significant homology with the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R). The deregulation of microRNAs, a class of short and small noncoding RNAs, has been shown to involve cardiovascular remodeling and pathogenesis of hypertension via the activation of the Ang II/AT1R pathway. MicroRNAs are linked with modulation of the ACE2/Apelin signaling, which exhibits beneficial effects in the cardiovascular system and hypertension. The ACE2-coupled crosstalk among the RAAS, the Apelin system, and microRNAs provides an important mechanistic insight into hypertension.

AIMS To evaluate the association of different apelin levels with cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization, renal function, and cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetic patients with mild to moderate CKD. METHODS An observational, prospective study involving 150 patients divided into groups according to baseline apelin levels: 1 \u2264 98 pg/mL, 2 = 98-328 pg/mL, and 3 \u2265 329 pg/mL. Baseline characteristics were analyzed and compared. Multivariate Cox regression was used to find out predictors of cardiovascular mortality, and multivariate logistic regression was used to find out predictors of hospitalization and disease progression. Simple linear regressions and Pearson correlations were used to investigate correlations between apelin and renal disease and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS Patients' survival at 83 months in groups 1, 2, and 3 was 39%, 40%, and 71.2%, respectively (P = 0.046). Apelin, age, and eGFR were independent predictors of mortality, and apelin, creatinine, eGFR, resistin, and visfatin were independent predictors of hospitalization.

Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause severe diseases in humans and animals, and, as of yet, none of the currently available broad-spectrum drugs or vaccines can effectively control these diseases. Host antiviral proteins play an important role in inhibiting viral proliferation. One of the isoforms of cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), PABPC4, is an RNA-processing protein, which plays an important role in promoting gene expression by enhancing translation and mRNA stability. However, its function in viruses remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the host protein, PABPC4, could be regulated by transcription factor SP1 and broadly inhibits the replication of CoVs, covering four genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus) of the Coronaviridae family by targeting the nucleocapsid (N) protein through the autophagosomes for degradation. PABPC4 recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8/MARCHF8 to the N protein for ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated N protein was recognized by the cargo receptor NDP52/CALCOCO2, which delivered it to the autolysosomes for degradation, resulting in impaired viral proliferation. In addition to regulating gene expression, these data demonstrate a novel antiviral function of PABPC4, which broadly suppresses CoVs by degrading the N protein via the selective autophagy pathway. This study will shed light on the development of broad anticoronaviral therapies. IMPORTANCE Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause severe diseases in humans and animals, but none of the currently available drugs or vaccines can effectively control these diseases. During viral infection, the host will activate the interferon (IFN) signaling pathways and host restriction factors in maintaining the innate antiviral responses and suppressing viral replication. This study demonstrated that the host protein, PABPC4, interacts with the nucleocapsid (N) proteins from eight CoVs covering four genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus) of the Coronaviridae family. PABPC4 could be regulated by SP1 and broadly inhibits the replication of CoVs by targeting the nucleocapsid (N) protein through the autophagosomes for degradation. This study significantly increases our understanding of the novel host restriction factor PABPC4 against CoV replication and will help develop novel antiviral strategies."

Human microproteins encoded by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been increasingly discovered, however, complete functional characterization of these emerging proteins is scattered. Here, we show that LINC00493-encoded SMIM26, an understudied microprotein localized in mitochondria, is tendentiously downregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and correlated with poor overall survival. LINC00493 is recognized by RNA-binding protein PABPC4 and transferred to ribosomes for translation of a 95-amino-acid protein SMIM26. SMIM26, but not LINC00493, suppresses ccRCC growth and metastatic lung colonization by interacting with acylglycerol kinase (AGK) and glutathione transport regulator SLC25A11 via its N-terminus. This interaction increases the mitochondrial localization of AGK and subsequently inhibits AGK-mediated AKT phosphorylation. Moreover, the formation of the SMIM26-AGK-SCL25A11 complex maintains mitochondrial glutathione import and respiratory efficiency, which is abrogated by AGK overexpression or SLC25A11 knockdown. This study functionally characterizes the LINC00493-encoded microprotein SMIM26 and establishes its anti-metastatic role in ccRCC, and therefore illuminates the importance of hidden proteins in human cancers."

Mitochondria are organelles known primarily for generating ATP via the oxidative phosphorylation process. Environmental signals are sensed by whole organisms or cells and markedly affect this process, leading to alterations in gene transcription and, consequently, changes in mitochondrial function and biogenesis. The expression of mitochondrial genes is finely regulated by nuclear transcription factors, including nuclear receptors and their coregulators. Among the best-known coregulators is the nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1). Muscle-specific knockout of NCoR1 in mice induces an oxidative phenotype, improving glucose and fatty acid metabolism. However, the mechanism by which NCoR1 is regulated remains elusive. In this work, we identified the poly(A)-binding protein 4 (PABPC4) as a new NCoR1 interactor. Unexpectedly, we found that silencing of PABPC4 induced an oxidative phenotype in both C2C12 and MEF cells, as indicated by increased oxygen consumption, mitochondria content, and reduced lactate production. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PABPC4 silencing increased the ubiquitination and consequent degradation of NCoR1, leading to the derepression of PPAR-regulated genes. As a consequence, cells with PABPC4 silencing had a greater capacity to metabolize lipids, reduced intracellular lipid droplets, and reduced cell death. Interestingly, in conditions known to induce mitochondrial function and biogenesis, both mRNA expression and PABPC4 protein content were markedly reduced. Our study, therefore, suggests that the lowering of PABPC4 expression may represent an adaptive event required to induce mitochondrial activity in response to metabolic stress in skeletal muscle cells. As such, the NCoR1-PABPC4 interface might be a new road to the treatment of metabolic diseases."

The association of the PABPC4 rs4660293 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and serum lipid profiles has, to the best of our knowledge, not previously been studied in the Chinese population. The present study aimed to investigate the association between the PABPC4 rs4660293 SNP and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels in the Mulao and Han populations. A total of 727 individuals of Mulao nationality and 729 individuals of Han nationality were randomly selected from stratified randomized samples from a previous study by our group.

The G allele carriers were found to have higher total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and ApoAI levels in Han females but not in Han males, and lower TC and HDL-C levels in Mulao females but not in Mulao males than those of the G allele non-carriers (P<0.05 for all). These associations were confirmed by multiple linear regression analysis (P<0.05\u20110.001). Serum lipid parameters were also correlated with multiple environmental factors (P<0.05\u20110.001).

Here, we determined the crystal structures of the MLLE domain from PABPC1 in complex with the two PAM2 regions of eRF3.

In order to detect and characterize the E5B protein, an 18 nucleotide sequence encoding a 6 amino acid epitope was added to the 3' end of the E5B open-reading frame which was then expressed in COS-1 cells using a SV40 vector. Immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and cell fractionation studies identified the E5B protein as a 4-kDa protein and localized it primarily to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus. Unlike the E5A protein of BPV-1, E5B did not form dimers (despite containing a cysteine residue) or form complexes with growth factor receptors such as the PDGF receptor or erb B-2 receptor.

Here we describe ten novel ABL1 1b point mutations, including two from clinical isolates, that cause constitutive kinase activation and cellular transformation. All mutants retained sensitivity to ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Several substitutions cluster near the myristoyl-binding pocket, the target of ABL001, a novel clinically active allosteric kinase inhibitor that mimics the autoinhibitory myristoyl group, and likely activate the kinase by relieving physiologic autoinhibition.

These include the maintenance of inducible NF-kappaB-dependent gene transcription, as well as termination of inducible transcription. We show that IkappaBalpha shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, utilizing the nuclear export receptor CRM1.

In mammalian cells, inhibition of CRM1 by leptomycin B resulted in nuclear localization of cotransfected p65 and IkappaBalpha in COS cells and enhanced nuclear relocation of endogenous p65 in T cells. These observations suggest that the main function of IkappaBalpha is that of a nuclear export chaperone rather than a cytoplasmic tether.

IkappaBalpha is an inhibitory molecule that sequesters NF-kappaB dimers in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. Upon stimulation, NF-kappaB moves to the nucleus and induces the expression of a variety of genes including IkappaBalpha. This newly synthesized IkappaBalpha also translocates to the nucleus, removes activated NF-kappaB from its target genes, and brings it back to the cytoplasm to terminate the phase of NF-kappaB activation. We show here that IkappaBalpha enhances the transactivation potential of several homeodomain-containing proteins such as HOXB7 and Pit-1 through a NF-kappaB-independent association with histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and HDAC3 but not with HDAC2, -4, -5, and -6. IkappaBalpha bound both HDAC proteins through its ankyrin repeats, and this interaction was disrupted by p65. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated further that IkappaBalpha acts by partially redirecting HDAC3 to the cytoplasm. At the same time, an IkappaBalpha mutant, which lacked a functional nuclear localization sequence, interacted very efficiently with HDAC1 and -3 and intensively enhanced the transactivation potential of Pit-1. Our results support the hypothesis that the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha regulates the transcriptional activity of homeodomain-containing proteins positively through cytoplasmic sequestration of HDAC1 and HDAC3, a mechanism that would assign a new and unexpected role to IkappaBalpha."

Antibodies to N-terminal peptides of p50, p52, p65 or c-Rel supershifted only a fraction of NF-kappaBx.

In comparison to J774 cells, incubation of mouse peritoneal macrophages with MCG resulted in more extensive alterations to NF-KB proteins. The alterations in NF-KB proteins did not affect the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) or TNF-alpha mRNA inJ774 cells. These data indicate that exposure of J774 cells to MCG leads to generation of altered nuclear p52, p65 and c-Rel, which retain intact N-terminal peptides, specific oligonucleotide binding and transactivating activity.

The human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein transforms T cells through induced expression of many cellular genes, including those encoding the growth-related proteins interleukin 2 and the alpha chain of its receptor. Induction of these genes is mediated, at least in part, through Tax-dependent posttranslational activation of NF-kappa B, typically heterodimers of p50 (NF-kappa B1) and p65 (RelA). The preexisting NF-kappa B proteins are retained in the cytoplasm of cells by association with inhibitory ankyrin-motif-containing I kappa B proteins, primarily I kappa B-alpha but also including the precursor proteins p105 (NF-kappa B1) and p100 (NF-kappa B2). Here we demonstrate the existence of a previously undescribed multimeric cytoplasmic complex in which NF-kappa B dimers are associated with the p100 inhibitor in a manner dependent on the precursor protein's ankyrin domain. We also demonstrate an antagonistic effect of the Tax protein on the cytoplasmic sequestration function of p100; this in turn leads to nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B dimers liberated from multimeric complexes. Tax may exert these effects through the physical association with p100. Tax also relieves the p100-mediated inhibition of DNA binding by p50-p65 heterodimers in vitro. The results demonstrate a mechanism by which Tax may activate NF-kappa B in T cells."

NF-kB proteins belong to a family of ubiquitous transcription factors involved in a number of cellular responses. While the pathways of NF-kB activation and input into the regulation of gene activity have been comprehensively investigated, its cytoplasmic functions are poorly understood. In this study we addressed effects of the compartmentalisation of NF-kB proteins RelA/p65 and p50 in relation to the inhibitor IkB-a, using fibronectin (FN) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) for environmental stimulation of epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. We thus assessed the presence of NF-kB family proteins in the cytosol, membrane, nuclear and cytoskeletal fractions with a special attention to the cytoskeletal fraction to define whether NFkB was active or not. Sub-cellular fractionation demonstrated that the proportion of RelA/p65 differed in diverse sub-cellular fractions, and that the cytoskeleton harboured about 7% thereof. Neither the nuclear nor the cytoskeleton fraction did contain IkB-a. The cytoskeleton binding of RelA/p65 and p50 was further confirmed by co-localisation and electron microscopy data. During 30-min EGF stimulation similar dynamics were found for RelA/p65 and IkB-a in the cytosol, RelA/p65 and p50 in the nucleus and p50 and IkB-a in the membrane. Furthermore, EGF stimulation for 30 min resulted in a threefold accumulation of RelA/p65 in cytoskeletal fraction. Our results suggest that nuclear-, membrane- and cytoskeleton-associated NF-kB are dynamic and comprise active pools, whereas the cytoplasmic is more constant and likely non-active due to the presence of IkB-a. Moreover, we discovered the existence of a dynamic, IkB-a-free pool of RelA/p65 associated with cytoskeletal fraction, what argues for a special regulatory role of the cytoskeleton in NF-kB stimulation."

Two subclones were found to have an abnormal response to the protein kinase C (PKC) activator PMA. PMA treatment induced CD3 and CD25 (IL-2R) receptors on the parental line and on other ethyl-methanesulfonate-derived subclones, but not on these two mutants. Direct assays of PKC activity were conducted. Total cellular PKC enzymatic activity was found to be normal in these subclones. PMA-induced CD4 down-modulation occurred normally. In addition, activation of c-raf kinase was normal. Since HIV-1 long terminal repeat contains two functional nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) regulatory elements, we studied the ability of PMA to induce NF-kB binding activity by different assays. Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assays using the HIV-1 (-139)long terminal repeat-CAT construct showed no PMA induction of CAT activity in these subclones (unlike the parental line and other subclones). Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatases 1 and 2A, did not overcome the defect in these subclones. Gel retardation assays, using a 32P-probe containing the HIV-1 NF-kB probe and nuclear extracts from PMA-treated cells, showed significantly reduced induction of nuclear NF-kB binding proteins in these two subclones compared with wild type CEM and a control subclone. Deoxycholate treatment of cytoplasmic extracts from these subclones released much reduced NF-kB binding proteins from their cytoplasmic pools. Thus, reduced levels of PKC-induced nuclear NF-kB activity in two T cell subclones did not affect their normal cell growth, but correlated with a pronounced reduction in their susceptibility to HIV-1 infection."

BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common hereditary disorders among Caucasians. The most common mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene have been well established among Caucasian populations. In Koreans, however, there are very few cases of genetically confirmed CF thus far, and the spectrum of mutations seems quite different from that observed in Caucasians. METHODS In the present study, we describe the cases of 2 Korean CF patients, present sequencing results identifying mutations in their CFTR gene, and summarize the results of CFTR mutational spectrum from previously reported Korean CF patients. The mutations described were identified by performing direct sequencing analysis of the complete coding regions and flanking intronic sequences of the CFTR gene, followed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis in order to detect gene deletions or duplications that could not be identified by a direct sequencing method. RESULTS Three CFTR mutations were identified in the 2 patients, including p.Q98R, c.2052delA, and c.579+5G>A. In an analysis of 9 Korean CF patients that included the 2 patients presented in this study, p.Q98R mutation was the only recurrently observed mutation with a frequency of 18.8% (3/16 alleles). Furthermore, only one of the mutations (c.3272-26A>G) was found among the 32 common mutations in the screening panel for Caucasians from the Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database. CONCLUSIONS Sequencing of the entire CFTR gene followed by MLPA analysis, rather than using the targeted sequencing-based screening panel for mutations commonly found in Caucasian populations, is recommended for genetic analysis of Korean CF patients."

CFTR is one of the most well-known genes related to male fertility. The frequency of CFTR mutations or impaired CFTR expression is increased in men with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA).

However, whether p.G970D participates in male infertility remains unknown. Herein, a loss-of-function CFTR p.G970D missense mutation was identified in a patient with CBAVD and NOA. Subsequent retrospective analysis of 122 Chinese patients with CBAVD showed that the mutation is a common pathogenic mutation (4.1%, 5/122), excluding polymorphic sites. Furthermore, we generated model cell lines derived from mouse testes harboring the homozygous Cftr p.G965D mutation equivalent to the CFTR variant in patients.

METHODS This cohort study enrolled congenital OA patients undergoing ART and whole-exome sequencing from January 2018 to September 2023. Semen parameters, sex hormones, and seminal plasma biochemistry were evaluated. CFTR mutations identified in OA patients were analyzed. In addition, the laboratory outcomes, clinical outcomes, and neonatal outcomes were compared between OA patients carrying two CFTR mutations and the others after surgical sperm extraction-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. RESULTS A total of 76 patients with congenital OA were enrolled. CFTR mutations were identified in 35 (46.1%) congenital OA patients. A total of 60 CFTR mutation sites of 27 types were identified, and 10 of them were novel. The average frequency was 1.71 (60/35) per person. The most common mutation was c.1210-11T > G (25%, 15/60). After ICSI treatment, there were no statistically significant differences in laboratory outcomes, clinical outcomes, and neonatal outcomes between OA patients carrying two CFTR mutations (n = 25) and other OA patients (n = 51). CONCLUSION Apart from the IVS9-5T mutation, the genetic mutation pattern of CFTR in Chinese OA patients is heterogeneous, which is significantly different from that of Caucasians.

BACKGROUND/AIMS Mutations in the CFTR gene cause Cystic Fibrosis (CF) the most common life-threatening autosomal recessive disease affecting Caucasians. We identified a CFTR mutation (c.120del23) abolishing the normal translation initiation codon, which occurs in two Portuguese CF patients. This study aims at functionally characterizing the effect of this novel mutation. METHODS RNA and protein techniques were applied to both native tissues from CF patients and recombinant cells expressing CFTR constructs to determine whether c.120del23 allows CFTR protein production through usage of alternative internal codons, and to characterize the putative truncated CFTR form(s). RESULTS Our data show that two shorter forms of CFTR protein are produced when the initiation translation codon is deleted indicating usage of internal initiation codons. The N-truncated CFTR generated by this mutation has decreased stability, very low processing efficiency, and drastically reduced function. Analysis of mutants of four methionine codons downstream to M1 (M82, M150, M152, M156) revealed that each of the codons M150/M152/M156 (exon 4) can mediate CFTR alternative translation. CONCLUSIONS The CFTR N-terminus has an important role in avoiding CFTR turnover and in rendering effective its plasma membrane traffic.

DNA methylation is an important modification of DNA that plays a role in genome management and in regulating gene expression during development. Methylation is carried out by DNA methyltransferases which catalyse the transfer of a methyl group to bases within the DNA helix. Plants have at least three classes of cytosine methyltransferase which differ in protein structure and function. The METI family, homologues of the mouse Dnmtl methyltransferase, most likely function as maintenance methyltransferases, but may also play a role in de novo methylation. The chromomethylases, which are unique to plants, may preferentially methylate DNA in heterochromatin; the remaining class, with similarity to Dnmt3 methyltransferases of mammals, are putative de novo methyltransferases. The various classes of methyltransferase may show differential activity on cytosines in different sequence contexts. Chromomethylases may preferentially methylate cytosines in CpNpG sequences while the Arabidopsis METI methyltransferase shows a preference for cytosines in CpG sequences. Additional proteins, for example DDM1, a member of the SNF2/SWI2 family of chromatin remodelling proteins, are also required for methylation of plant DNA."

Animal genomes are organized into chromosomes that are remarkably conserved in their gene content, forming distinct evolutionary units (synteny). Using versatile chromosomal modeling, we infer three-dimensional topology of genomes from representative clades spanning the earliest animal diversification. We apply a partitioning approach using interaction spheres to compensate for varying quality of topological data. Using comparative genomics approaches, we test whether syntenic signal at gene pair, local, and whole chromosomal scale is reflected in the reconstructed spatial organization. We identify evolutionarily conserved three-dimensional networks at all syntenic scales revealing novel evolutionarily maintained interactors associated with known conserved local gene linkages (such as hox). We thus present evidence for evolutionary constraints that are associated with three-, rather than just two-, dimensional animal genome organization, which we term spatiosynteny. As more accurate topological data become available, together with validation approaches, spatiosynteny may become relevant in understanding the functionality behind the observed conservation of animal chromosomes."

BACKGROUND Early evolution of animals led to profound changes in body plan organization, symmetry and the rise of tissue complexity including formation of muscular and nervous systems. This process was associated with massive restructuring of animal genomes as well as deletion, acquisition and rapid differentiation of genes from a common metazoan ancestor. Here, we present a simple but efficient workflow for elucidation of gene gain and gene loss within major branches of the animal kingdom. METHODS We have designed a pipeline of sequence comparison, clustering and functional annotation using 12 major phyla as illustrative examples. Specifically, for the input we used sets of ab initio predicted gene models from the genomes of six bilaterians, three basal metazoans (Cnidaria, Placozoa, Porifera), two unicellular eukaryotes (Monosiga and Capsospora) and the green plant Arabidopsis as an out-group. Due to the large amounts of data the software required a high-performance Linux cluster. The final results can be imported into standard spreadsheet analysis software and queried for the numbers and specific sets of genes absent in specific genomes, uniquely present or shared among different taxons. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The developed software is open source and available free of charge on Open Source principles. It allows the user to address a number of specific questions regarding gene gain and gene loss in particular genomes, and user-defined groups of genomes can be formulated in a type of logical expression. For example, our analysis of 12 sequenced genomes indicated that these genomes possess at least 90,000 unique genes and gene families, suggesting enormous diversity of the genome repertoire in the animal kingdom. Approximately 9% of these gene families are shared universally (homologous) among all genomes, 53% are unique to specific taxa, and the rest are shared between two or more distantly related genomes."

Here we present an expansive collection of datasets from eight diverse tissues in three important agricultural species: chicken (Gallus gallus), pig (Sus scrofa), and cattle (Bos taurus). Comparative analysis of these datasets and those from the human and mouse Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects reveal that a core set of regulatory elements are functionally conserved independent of divergence between species, and that tissue-specific transcription factor occupancy at regulatory elements and their predicted target genes are also conserved.

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the most important crops worldwide and is severely affected by geminiviruses. Tomato leaf curl Taiwan virus (ToLCTWV), belonging to the geminiviruses, was isolated in Taiwan and causes tremendous crop loss. The geminivirus-encoded C2 proteins are crucial for a successful interaction between the virus and host plants. However, the exact functions of the viral C2 protein of ToLCTWV have not been investigated. We analyzed the molecular function(s) of the C2 protein by transient or stable expression in tomato cv. Micro-Tom and Nicotiana benthamiana. Severe stunting of tomato and N. benthamiana plants infected with ToLCTWV was observed. Expression of ToLCTWV C2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was predominately located in the nucleus and contributed to activation of a coat protein promoter. Notably, the C2-GFP fluorescence was distributed in nuclear aggregates. Tomato and N. benthamiana plants inoculated with potato virus X (PVX)-C2 displayed chlorotic lesions and stunted growth. PVX-C2 elicited hypersensitive responses accompanied by production of reactive oxygen species in N. benthamiana plants, which suggests that the viral C2 was a potential recognition target to induce host-defense responses. In tomato and N. benthamiana, ToLCTWV C2 was found to interfere with expression of genes encoding chromomethylases. N. benthamiana plants with suppressed NbCMT3-2 expression were more susceptible to ToLCTWV infection. Transgenic N. benthamiana plants expressing the C2 protein showed decreased expression of the NbCMT3-2 gene and pNbCMT3-2::GUS (\u03b2-glucuronidase) promoter activity. C2 protein is an important pathogenicity determinant of ToLCTWV and interferes with host components involved in DNA methylation."

Mitochondrial genomes have been useful for inferring animal phylogeny across a wide range of clades, however they are still poorly sampled in some animal taxa, limiting our knowledge of mtDNA evolution. For example, despite being one of the most diverse animal phyla, only 5 complete annelid mitochrondial genomes have been published. To address this paucity of information, we obtained complete mitochondrial genomic sequences from Pista cristata (Terebellidae) and Terebellides stroemi (Trichobranchidae) as well as one nearly complete mitochondrial genome from Eclysippe vanelli (Ampharetidae). These taxa are within Terebelliformia (Annelida), which include spaghetti worms, icecream cone worms and their relatives. In contrast to the 37 genes found in most bilaterian metazoans, we recover 38 genes in the mitochondrial genomes of T. stroemi and P. cristata due to the presence of a second methionine tRNA (trnM). Interestingly, the two trnMs are located next to each other and are possibly a synapomorphy of these two taxa. The E. vanelli partial mitochondrial genome lacks this additional trnM at the same position, but it may be present in the region not sampled. Compared to other annelids, gene orders of these three mitochondrial genomes are generally conserved except for the atp6-mSSU region. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that mtDNA data strongly supports a Trichobranchidae/Terebellidae clade."

Tunicates or urochordates-comprising ascidians, larvaceans, and salps-are the only metazoans that can synthesize cellulose, a biological function usually associated with bacteria and plants but not animals. Tunicate cellulose or tunicine is a major component of the outer acellular coverage (tunic) of the entire body of these organisms. Previous studies have suggested that the prokaryotic cellulose synthase gene (CesA) was horizontally transferred into the genome of a tunicate ancestor. However, no convenient tools have been devised to determine whether only tunicates harbor CesA. ORTHOSCOPE is a recently developed tool used to identify orthologous genes and to examine the phylogenic relationship of molecules within major metazoan taxa. The present analysis with this tool revealed the presence of CesA orthologs in all sequenced tunicate genomes but an absence in other metazoan genomes.

Representatives of the five major spliceosomal snRNAs were found in all genomes. None of the minor splicesomal snRNAs were detected in nematodes or in the shotgun traces of Oikopleura dioica, while in all other animal genomes at most one of them is missing. Although snRNAs are present in multiple copies in most genomes, distinguishable paralogue groups are not stable over long evolutionary times, although they appear independently in several clades. In general, animal snRNA secondary structures are highly conserved, albeit, in particular, U11 and U12 in insects exhibit dramatic variations. An analysis of genomic context of snRNAs reveals that they behave like mobile elements, exhibiting very little syntenic conservation."

However, little research has examined factors associated with quality of life among adults with autism spectrum disorder. METHOD This study comparing 66 adults with autism spectrum disorder (intelligence quotient > 70) aged 20-38 years with neuro-typical adults investigated their quality of life and related factors. All the participants were interviewed with questionnaires by a registered occupational therapist. RESULTS Participants with autism spectrum disorder scored significantly lower in all domains of quality of life than did the controls. Adults with autism spectrum disorder reported higher anxiety level, more loneliness, and higher scores on four sensory quadrants than neuro-typical adults. The predictors of the physical health domain were anxiety and sensation-sensitivity behaviors. Loneliness and sensation-sensitivity behaviors were predictive of the psychological health domain. Comorbid psychiatric disorders and loneliness were predictive of the social relationship domain. CONCLUSIONS Adults with autism spectrum disorder need more supportive social contexts and interventions to improve their quality of life. Social relationships, psychological health, and sensory processing difficulty must be considered when designing treatment programs for adults with autism spectrum disorder.

First, this chapter addresses how adenosine A2A receptors are involved with brain motor control via the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit, considering anatomical and ultrastructural localization of the receptor in critical areas/neurons of the circuit. Then, based on the understanding of the functional significance of the receptor in the circuit, the mode of action of adenosine A2A receptor antagonists is explained by dynamism of the circuit and possible cellular mechanisms, highlighting the importance of the pathophysiological difference proposed between normal and disease state."

PURPOSE Overactive bladder is highly prevalent among patients with Parkinson disease. Adenosine is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system but it is not fully clarified how adenosine receptors regulate the micturition reflex. Thus, we examined the effect of an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist on the micturition reflex in a rat model of Parkinson disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS In a rat model of Parkinson disease induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, Missouri) injection we examined the effects of the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist ZM241385, the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 and the dopamine D2 receptor agonist quinpirole on bladder activity. RESULTS Intravenous administration of ZM241385 increased the intercontraction interval in a dose dependent manner in rats with Parkinson disease and sham operated rats but the inhibitory effect was greater in the Parkinson disease group. Intrathecal and intracerebroventricular administration of ZM241385 increased the intercontraction interval in each group. However, in rats with Parkinson disease the inhibitory effects induced by intracerebroventricular administration of ZM241385 were greater than in sham operated rats. Intravenous administration of SKF38393 increased the intercontraction interval in rats with Parkinson disease and subsequent administration of ZM further increased the intercontraction interval. However, SKF38393 did not increase the intercontraction interval after ZM241385 application. Also, ZM241385 increased the intercontraction interval without being affected by pre-administration or post-administration of quinpirole, which decreased the intercontraction interval. CONCLUSIONS Results indicate that the adenosine A2A receptor mediated excitatory mechanism is enhanced at a supraspinal site to induce bladder overactivity and A2A receptor inhibition effectively suppresses bladder overactivity in rats with Parkinson disease. Thus, adenosine A2A receptor antagonists could be useful for bladder dysfunction in Parkinson disease cases."

During a program to investigate the biochemical basis of side effects associated with the antimalarial drug mefloquine, the authors made the unexpected discovery that the (-)-(R,S)-enantiomer of the drug is a potent adenosine A2A receptor antagonist. Although the compound was ineffective in in vivo animal models of central adenosine receptor function, it provided a unique nonxanthine adenosine A2A receptor antagonist lead structure and encouraged the initiation of a medicinal chemistry program to develop novel adenosine A2A antagonists for the management of Parkinson's disease (PD). The authors have synthesized and screened more than 2,000 chemically diverse and novel adenosine A(2A antagonists. Early examples from two distinct chemical series are the thieno[3,2-dy]pyrimidine VER-6623 and the purine compounds VER-6947 and VER-7835, which have high affinity at adenosine A2A receptors (K(i) values 1.4, 1.1, and 1.7 nmol/L, respectively) and act as competitive antagonists. In particular, VER-6947 and VER-7835 demonstrate potent in vivo activity reversing the locomotor deficit caused by the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol, with minimum effective doses comparable with that of KW6002 (0.3 to 1 mg/kg).

OBJECTIVE To investigate striatal adenosine A2A receptor availability in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) with and without levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs). While providing effective relief from the motor symptoms of PD, chronic levodopa use is associated with development of LIDs. A2A receptors are expressed on the bodies of indirect pathway medium spiny striatal neurons and on dopamine terminals and play a role in modulating dopamine transmission. A2A antagonists have antiparkinsonian activity by boosting levodopa efficacy. We aimed to study A2A receptor availability in patients with PD with and without LIDs using PET and [\u00b9\u00b9C]SCH442416, an A2A antagonist. METHODS Six patients with PD with and 6 without LIDs were studied withdrawn 12 hours from medication. Their PET findings were compared with 6 age-matched healthy controls. Using spectral analysis, [\u00b9\u00b9C]SCH442416 regional volumes of distribution (V(T)) were computed for the caudate, putamen, and thalamus and binding potentials (BP(ND)) reflecting the ratio of specific:nonspecific uptake were compared between groups. RESULTS A2A binding in the caudate and putamen of subjects with PD with LIDs was far higher (p = 0.026 and p = 0.036, respectively) than that of subjects with PD without LIDs, which lay within the control range. Thalamic A2A availability was similar for all 3 groups. CONCLUSION Patients with PD with LIDs show increased A2A receptor availability in the striatum. This finding is compatible with altered adenosine transmission playing a role in LIDs and provides a rationale for a trial of A2A receptor agents in the treatment of these motor complications."

OBJECTIVE Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists are potential new treatments for Parkinson disease. We used positron emission tomography (PET) of the A2A receptor radiotracer, [C]SCH442416, to assess binding of the novel A2A antagonist, vipadenant (previously known as BIIB014), to human brain A2A receptors and to investigate the relationship among dose, steady-state plasma levels, and receptor occupancy. METHODS We used PET to compare [C]SCH442416 uptake before and after blockade with daily oral vipadenant (2.5-100 mg/d for 10 or 11 days) in healthy volunteers (n = 15). We estimated receptor occupancy in brain regions of interest, particularly the putamen, by kinetic modeling of PET data. We estimated the dose, minimal plasma concentration at steady state (Cmin), and area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC0-tau) at the steady state required for saturation (> or =90% receptor occupancy) using Bayesian Emax and logistic regression models. RESULTS The estimated receptor occupancy of vipadenant in the brain regions of interest varied from 74% to 94% at the lowest daily dose (2.5 mg) and reached saturation in all regions at 100 mg. In the putamen, the estimated minimal daily dose, steady-state Cmin, and steady-state AUC0-tau required for receptor saturation were 10.2 mg (interquartile range, 28%), 0.097 microg/mL (27%), and 6 microg h/mL (21%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study provides the first evidence that vipadenant occupies A2A receptors in the human brain. Receptor occupancy was related to both dose and plasma levels of vipadenant. These results, coupled with previous efficacy results in animals, justify continued development of vipadenant as a potential treatment for Parkinson disease."

The last several years have witnessed exciting progress in the development of immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. This has been due in great part to the development of so-called checkpoint blockade. That is, antibodies that block inhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 and thus unleash antigen-specific immune responses against tumors. It is clear that tumors evade the immune response by usurping pathways that play a role in negatively regulating normal immune responses. In this regard, adenosine in the immune microenvironment leading to the activation of the A2a receptor has been shown to represent one such negative feedback loop. Indeed, the tumor microenvironment has relatively high concentrations of adenosine. To this end, blocking A2a receptor activation has the potential to markedly enhance anti-tumor immunity in mouse models. This review will present data demonstrating the ability of A2a receptor blockade to enhance tumor vaccines, checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell therapy. Also, as several recent studies have demonstrated that under certain conditions A2a receptor blockade can enhance tumor progression, we will also explore the complexities of adenosine signaling in the immune response. Despite important nuances to the A2a receptor pathway that require further elucidation, studies to date strongly support the development of A2a receptor antagonists (some of which have already been tested in phase III clinical trials for Parkinson Disease) as novel modalities in the immunotherapy armamentarium."

We conducted a narrative literature review on the treatments available for this condition using the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) classification of therapeutic evidence. We found effective and safe pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies with heterogeneity of clinical trial designs for patients with CH, and they are divided into three phases, namely, transitional, acute, and preventive interventions. Prednisone (A) is the most studied treatment in the transitional phase; acute attacks are treated using triptans (A), oxygen (A), and non-invasive transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (A). Verapamil (A) and monoclonal antibodies (possible A) are considered the first options in preventive treatments, followed by multiple pharmacological and non-pharmacological options in prophylactic treatments.

Cluster headache is a strictly unilateral headache that is associated with ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms and usually has a circadian and circannual pattern. Prevalence is estimated at 0.5 to 1.0/1,000. The diagnosis of cluster headache is made based on the patient's case history. There are two main clinical patterns of cluster headache: the episodic and the chronic. Episodic is the most common pattern of cluster headache. It occurs in periods lasting 7 days to 1 year and is separated by at least a 1-month pain-free interval. The attacks in the chronic form occur for more than 1 year without remission periods or with remission periods lasting less than 1 month. Conservative therapy consists of abortive and preventative remedies. Ergotamines and sumatriptan injections, sublingual ergotamine tartrate administration, and oxygen inhalation are effective abortive therapies. Verapamil is an effective and the safest prophylactic remedy. When pharmacological and oxygen therapies fail, interventional pain treatment may be considered. The effectiveness of radiofrequency treatment of the ganglion pterygopalatinum and of occipital nerve stimulation is only evaluated in observational studies, resulting in a 2 C+ recommendation. In conclusion, the primary treatment is medication. Radiofrequency treatment of the ganglion pterygopalatinum should be considered in patients who are resistant to conservative pain therapy. In patients with cluster headache refractory to all other treatments, occipital nerve stimulation may be considered, preferably within the context of a clinical study."

It is important to find effective and safe pharmacological options for managing cluster headache (CH) because there is limited evidence from studies supporting the general efficacy and safety of pharmacological therapies. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) analyzed published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments in patients with CH. The PubMed and Embase databases were searched to identify RCTs that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for CH. Efficacy outcomes included frequency and duration of attacks, pain-free rate, and the use of rescue agents. Safety outcomes were evaluated based on the number of patients who experienced adverse events. A total of 23 studies were included in the analysis. The frequency of attacks was reduced (mean difference (MD) = \u22121.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) = \u22121.62 to \u22120.47; p = 0.0004), and the pain-free rate was increased (odds ratio (OR) = 3.89, 95% CI = 2.76\u22125.48; p < 0.00001) in the pharmacological treatment group, with a lower frequency of rescue agent use than the placebo group. Preventive, acute, and triptan or non-triptan therapies did not show significant differences in efficacy (p > 0.05). In the NMA, different results were shown among the interventions; for example, zolmitriptan 5 mg was more effective than zolmitriptan 10 mg in the pain-free outcome (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.19\u22120.82; p < 0.05). Pharmacological treatment was shown to be more effective than placebo to manage CH with differences among types of therapies and individual interventions, and it was consistently shown to be associated with the development of adverse events. Thus, individualized therapy approaches should be applied to treat CH in real-world practice."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW To highlight current evidence supporting the prescription of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as part of first-line preventive treatment for children and adolescents with headache and discuss a research strategy aimed at: (1) understanding how and why CBT works, and (2) developing effective and efficient approaches for integrating CBT into headache specialty, neurology, and primary care settings. RECENT FINDINGS Although preventive medications for pediatric headache and migraine are commonly prescribed, recent meta-analyses and an NIH-funded, multi-center clinical trial suggests that the effect of pill-taking therapies may be mostly due to a placebo effect. These findings have led to greater consideration of prescription of non-pharmacological therapies as first-line interventions (either alone or in combination with pill-based therapy). A literature that extends back to the 1980s and includes recent clinical trials and meta-analyses demonstrates that CBT decreases headache frequency and related disability in youth with headache and migraine and has a favorable benefit to risk profile with almost no negative side effects. SUMMARY CBT has been repeatedly demonstrated as effective in treating pediatric headache and migraine. As such, it should be considered as part of first-line preventive treatment for pediatric headache (either alone or in combination with a pill-based therapy). We need to better understand how this therapy works and what makes it distinct (if anything) from the placebo effect. What we need to achieve is empirical support for efficient access to this evidence-based treatment and clarity on how to match the intensity of non-pharmacological intervention to the needs of our patients at the time they present for care."

OBJECTIVE To analyse knowledge and use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies in headache patients referred to a tertiary headache centre. METHODS We included 114 consecutive patients referred by a neurologist and asked them to fill out a comprehensive questionnaire immediately before their first appointment at our outpatient headache clinic. The questionnaire covered 23 compounds for acute treatment, 21 prophylactic drugs, and 30 complementary and alternative treatments. RESULTS The proportion of patients who knew at least one acute therapy stood at 92 %; 62 % knew at least one pharmaco-prophylaxis and 80 % knew at least one non-pharmacological treatment. Even though 87 % of the patients with migraine had \u00b3 4 disabling headache days per month, only 41 % had used triptans and not more than 19 % had taken drugs of first choice for migraine prophylaxis for at least 3 months.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this Delphi survey was to establish an international consensus on the most useful outcome measures for research on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for migraine. This is important, since guidelines for pharmacological trials recommend measuring the frequency of headaches with 50% reduction considered a clinically meaningful effect. It is unclear whether the same recommendations apply to complementary (or adjunct) non-pharmacological approaches, whether the same cut-off levels need to be considered for effectiveness when used as an adjunct or stand-alone intervention, and what is meaningful to patients. SETTING University-initiated international survey. PARTICIPANTS The expert panel was chosen based on publications on non-pharmacological interventions in migraine populations and from personal contacts. 35 eligible researchers were contacted, 12 agreed to participate and 10 completed all 3 rounds of the survey. To further explore how migraine patients viewed potential outcome measures, four migraine patients were interviewed and presented with the same measurement tools as the researchers. PROCEDURES The initial Delphi round was based on a systematic search of the literature for outcome measures used in non-pharmacological interventions for headache. Suggested outcome measures were rated by each expert, blinded towards the other members of the panel, for its usefulness on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from definitely not useful to extremely useful. Results were combined using median values and IQRs. Tools rated overall as definitely or probably not useful were excluded from subsequent rounds. Experts further suggested additional outcome measures that were presented to the panel in subsequent rounds. Additionally, experts were asked to rank the most useful tools and provide information on feasible cut-off levels for effectiveness for the three highest ranked tools. RESULTS Results suggest the use of the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and headache frequency as primary outcome measures. Patient experts suggested the inclusion of a measure of quality of life and evaluation of associated symptoms and fear of attacks. CONCLUSIONS Recommendations are for the use of the MIDAS, the HIT-6 and headache frequency, in combination with an outcome measure for quality of life. Associated symptoms and fear of attacks should also be considered as secondary outcomes, if relevant for the individual target population. The cut-off level for effectiveness should be lower for non-pharmacological interventions, especially when used as an adjunct to medication.

EXPERT OPINION Non-pharmacological interventions are generally preferred as the first-line approach to improve sleep-related symptoms in AD due to their favorable safety profile. However, when non-pharmacological interventions alone are insufficient, a range of pharmacological agents can be considered. Trazodone and melatonin are commonly used as adjunctive therapies, while Z-drugs including zopiclone and zolpidem are specifically employed to treat insomnia in patients with late-onset AD. Furthermore, a newer class of agents known as dual orexin receptor antagonists has emerged and gained approval for improving sleep onset and maintenance in AD patients."

INTRODUCTION Cluster headache (CH) is the most frequent subtype of trigeminal headache with autonomic symptoms (THAS); yet, despite its characteristic clinical profile it remains poorly understood and badly controlled. AIMS To identify the correct diagnostic criteria of CH and the respective differential diagnoses, as well as to gain an understanding of the pathophysiology of CH, its treatment and prognosis by means of a review of the literature. DEVELOPMENT AND CONCLUSIONS CH is a condition that is characterised by the presence of sharp, or extremely sharp, unilateral pain that is short-lasting and usually located in the retroocular and/or temporal region; it is also accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (mainly conjunctival injection). CH can be differentiated from other THAS by the frequency with which it appears and the amount of time the pain lasts (the average is less than five attacks a day lasting from 30 minutes to 3 hours), as well as the response to treatment. A number of neuronal pathways are involved in the pathophysiology of CH. It has been suggested that the activation of the trigeminovascular and the parasympathetic systems, together with the dysfunction of the cranial sympathetic system, are involved in this condition. Moreover, there is evidence to support the role of functional and structural alterations in the hypothalamus. Treatment of CH is based on the proper pharmacological implementation of abortive, transitional and prophylactic therapies. Surgical interventions are recommended in patients with strictly unilateral pain in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve who are resistant to multiple therapies, and/or offer a poor response and/or contraindications to pharmacological treatment. Factors related to genetics, brain functioning or the environment, as well as the way the symptoms present (episodic or chronic), determine the prognosis of CH."

Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2) plays an essential role in regulating cell proliferation through phosphorylating AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT, PKC and SGK1. The functional core complex consists of mTOR, mLST8, and two mTORC2-specific components, Rictor and mSin1. Here we investigated the intermolecular interactions within mTORC2 complex and determined its cryo-electron microscopy structure at 4.9 \u00c5 resolution. The structure reveals a hollow rhombohedral fold with a 2-fold symmetry. The dimerized mTOR serves as a scaffold for the complex assembly. The N-terminal half of Rictor is composed of helical repeat clusters and binds to mTOR through multiple contacts. mSin1 is located close to the FRB domain and catalytic cavity of mTOR. Rictor and mSin1 together generate steric hindrance to inhibit binding of FKBP12-rapamycin to mTOR, revealing the mechanism for rapamycin insensitivity of mTORC2. The mTOR dimer in mTORC2 shows more compact conformation than that of mTORC1 (rapamycin sensitive), which might result from the interaction between mTOR and Rictor-mSin1. Structural comparison shows that binding of Rictor and Raptor (mTORC1-specific component) to mTOR is mutually exclusive. Our study provides a basis for understanding the assembly of mTORC2 and a framework to further characterize the regulatory mechanism of mTORC2 pathway."

The PI3K-dependent signaling kinase complex mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2) has been defined as the regulatory Ser-473 kinase of Akt. The regulation of mTORC2 remains very poorly characterized. We have reconstituted mTORC2 by its assembly in vitro or by co-expression its four essential components (rictor, SIN1, mTOR, mLST8). We show that the functional mTOR kinase domain is required for the mTORC2 activity as the Ser-473 kinase of Akt. We also found that mTOR by phosphorylation of SIN1 prevents its lysosomal degradation. Thus, the kinase domain of mTOR is required for the functional activity of mTORC2, and it controls integrity of mTORC2 by maintaining the protein stability of SIN1."

Studies that define mTORC2 cellular functions and signaling have lagged behind. The development of pharmacological inhibitors that block mTOR kinase activity, and thereby inhibit both mTOR complexes, along with availability of mice with genetic knockouts in mTOR complex components have now provided new insights on mTORC2 function and regulation.

We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1, Sin1 and Rictor.

Signal integration has a crucial role in the cell fate decision and dysregulation of the cellular signaling pathways is a primary characteristic of cancer. As a signal integrator, mTOR shows a complex dynamical behavior which determines the cell fate at different cellular processes levels, including cell cycle progression, cell survival, cell death, metabolic reprogramming, and aging. The dynamics of the complex responses to rapamycin in cancer cells have been attributed to its differential time-dependent inhibitory effects on mTORC1 and mTORC2, the two main complexes of mTOR. Two explanations were previously provided for this phenomenon: 1-Rapamycin does not inhibit mTORC2 directly, whereas it prevents mTORC2 formation by sequestering free mTOR protein (Le Chatelier's principle). 2-Components like Phosphatidic Acid (PA) further stabilize mTORC2 compared with mTORC1. To understand the mechanism by which rapamycin differentially inhibits the mTOR complexes in the cancer cells, we present a mathematical model of rapamycin mode of action based on the first explanation, i.e., Le Chatelier's principle. Translating the interactions among components of mTORC1 and mTORC2 into a mathematical model revealed the dynamics of rapamycin action in different doses and time-intervals of rapamycin treatment. This model shows that rapamycin has stronger effects on mTORC1 compared with mTORC2, simply due to its direct interaction with free mTOR and mTORC1, but not mTORC2, without the need to consider other components that might further stabilize mTORC2. Based on our results, even when mTORC2 is less stable compared with mTORC1, it can be less inhibited by rapamycin."

Rapamycin and its analogs are currently used in the clinic to treat a variety of diseases and have been instrumental in delineating the functions of its direct target, mTORC1. Despite the lack of a specific mTORC2 inhibitor, genetic studies that disrupt mTORC2 expression unravel the functions of this more elusive mTOR complex.

A variety of downstream effectors of mTORC2 have been identified but the most well-characterized mTORC2 substrates include Akt, PKC, and SGK, which are members of the AGC protein kinase family.

Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be reduced by over-expression of the Cterminally deleted Raptor mutant (Raptor-\u0394CT) not binding to mTOR or LST8, while phosphorylation levels of Akt were markedly enhanced with no alteration in IRS-1 phosphorylation or PI 3-kinase activity. Using Raptor-\u0394CT, we investigated the competition for association with LST8 between mTORC1 and mTORC2. Over-expression of Raptor-\u0394CT abolished formation of the Raptor, S6 kinase, mTOR and LST8 complex, while the amount of LST8 in the Rictor-mTOR complex was increased. Therefore, it is likely that Raptor-mTOR and Rictor-mTOR complexes compete for association with LST8, and this mechanism may contribute to the reciprocal negative regulations of mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, in terms of their LST8 components.:"

To assess whether mTORC2 components display diurnal variations, we analyzed steady state mRNA expression levels of Rictor, mSin1, and mTor in various adipose tissues during a 24 h period. Diurnally regulated expression of Rictor was detected in brown adipose tissues displaying highest mRNA expression levels at the beginning of the 12 h light period (zeitgeber time 2, ZT2).

The mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which consists of the core components mTOR, Rictor, mSin1, and mLST8, primarily responds to growth signals. However, the coordination between mTORC2 assembly and activity remains poorly understood. Keap1, a major sensor of oxidative stress in cells, functions as a substrate adaptor for Cullin 3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) to promote proteasomal degradation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), which is a transcription factor that protects cells against oxidative and electrophilic stress. In the present study, we demonstrate that Keap1 binds to mLST8 via a conserved ETGE motif. The CRL3Keap1 ubiquitin ligase complex promotes non-degradative ubiquitination of mLST8, thus reducing mTORC2 complex integrity and mTORC2-AKT activation. However, this effect can be prevented by oxidative/electrophilic stresses and growth factor signaling-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. Cancer-derived Keap1 or mLST8 mutations disrupt the Keap1-mLST8 interaction and allow mLST8 to evade Keap1-mediated ubiquitination, thereby enhancing mTORC2-AKT activation and promoting cell malignancy and remodeling cell metabolism.

Sumoylation, the conjugation of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein to a target, has diverse cellular effects. However, the functional roles of the SUMO modification during myogenesis have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that basal sumoylation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) enhances the deacetylation of MyoD in undifferentiated myoblasts, whereas further sumoylation of HDAC1 contributes to switching its binding partners from MyoD to Rb to induce myocyte differentiation. Differentiation in C2C12 skeletal myoblasts induced new immunoblot bands above HDAC1 that were gradually enhanced during differentiation. Using SUMO inhibitors and sumoylation assays, we showed that the upper band was caused by sumoylation of HDAC1 during differentiation. Basal deacetylase activity was not altered in the SUMO modification-resistant mutant HDAC1 K444/476R (HDAC1 2R). Either differentiation or transfection of SUMO1 increased HDAC1 activity that was attenuated in HDAC1 2R. Furthermore, HDAC1 2R failed to deacetylate MyoD. Binding of HDAC1 to MyoD was attenuated by K444/476R. Binding of HDAC1 to MyoD was gradually reduced after 2 days of differentiation. Transfection of SUMO1 induced dissociation of HDAC1 from MyoD but potentiated its binding to Rb. SUMO1 transfection further attenuated HDAC1-induced inhibition of muscle creatine kinase luciferase activity that was reversed in HDAC1 2R. HDAC1 2R failed to inhibit myogenesis and muscle gene expression. In conclusion, HDAC1 sumoylation plays a dual role in MyoD signaling: enhancement of HDAC1 deacetylation of MyoD in the basally sumoylated state of undifferentiated myoblasts and dissociation of HDAC1 from MyoD during myogenesis."

Overexpression of c-Ski/SnoN also induces skeletal muscle differentiation, but how c-Ski/SnoN function in myogenesis is largely unknown.

Here, we biochemically characterize SnoN sumoylation in detail and report the physiological function of the modification. Sumoylation occurs primarily at lysine 50 (Lys-50). PIAS1 and PIASx proteins physically interact with SnoN to stimulate its sumoylation, thus serving as SUMO-protein isopeptide ligases (E3) for SnoN sumoylation. SnoN sumoylation does not alter its metabolic stability or its ability to repress TGF-beta signaling.

In this study, we demonstrate that SUMO modification of the transcription factor Sharp-1 is required for its full transcriptional repression activity and function as an inhibitor of skeletal muscle differentiation. Sharp-1 is modified by sumoylation at two conserved lysine residues 240 and 255. Mutation of these SUMO acceptor sites in Sharp-1 does not impact its subcellular localization but attenuates its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor and inhibit myogenic differentiation. Consistently, co-expression of the SUMO protease SENP1 with wild type Sharp-1 abrogates Sharp-1-dependent inhibition of myogenesis. Interestingly, sumoylation acts as a signal for recruitment of the co-repressor G9a. Thus, enrichment of G9a, and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), a signature of G9a activity, is dramatically reduced at muscle promoters in cells expressing sumoylation-defective Sharp-1.

BACKGROUND Sumoylation has emerged as an important posttranslational regulatory mechanism for transcription factors and cofactors. Sumoylation of many transcription factors represses their transcriptional activities. The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors plays an important role in regulating gene expression during myogenesis and has been recently shown to be sumoylated. RESULTS Consistent with earlier reports, we show that sumoylation of MEF2C at K391 inhibits its transcriptional activity. Sumoylation of MEF2C does not block its DNA-binding activity. A small C-terminal fragment of MEF2C containing K391, referred to as delta-N2-MEF2C, is efficiently sumoylated and, when targeted to DNA, represses transcription at neighbouring promoters. Because delta-N2-MEF2C lacks the binding site for class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), this result suggests that sumoylation of MEF2C may help to recruit transcriptional repressors other than these HDACs. Intriguingly, we show that phosphorylation of S396 in MEF2C, a residue in close proximity to the major sumoylation site (K391) and known to be phosphorylated in vivo, enhances sumoylation of delta- N2-MEF2C in vitro. The S396A mutation reduces sumoylation of MEF2C in vivo and enhances the transcription activity of MEF2C in reporter assays. CONCLUSION We propose that phosphorylation of MEF2C at S396 facilitates its sumoylation at K391, which in turn recruits yet unidentified co-repressors to inhibit transcription. Our studies further suggest that sumoylation motifs containing a phosphorylated serine or an acidic residue at the +5 position might be more efficiently sumoylated."

Here we investigate whether covalent protein modification by a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) that is known to affect transcription factor activity can impact muscle differentiation. We show that the overall load of sumoylated proteins present in myoblasts diminishes progressively throughout myogenesis. Interestingly, knockdown of the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, severely compromises C2C12 muscle cell terminal differentiation. However, it does not affect the expression, the localization and the activation of MyoD and myogenin. These novel results suggest that protein sumoylation plays a pivotal role in myoblast differentiation and is required to regulate the activity of key targets downstream of MyoD and myogenin."

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a tumor that consists of poorly differentiated skeletal muscle cells, is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children. Despite considerable progress within the last decades, therapeutic options are still limited, warranting the need for novel approaches. Recent data suggest deregulation of the Smyd1 protein, a sumoylation target as well as H3K4me2/3 methyltransferase and transcriptional regulator in myogenesis, and its binding partner skNAC, in RMS cells. Here, we show that despite the fact that most RMS cells express at least low levels of Smyd1 and skNAC, failure to upregulate expression of these genes in reaction to differentiation-promoting signals can always be observed. While overexpression of the Smyd1 gene enhances many aspects of RMS cell differentiation and inhibits proliferation rate and metastatic potential of these cells, functional integrity of the putative Smyd1 sumoylation motif and its SET domain, the latter being crucial for HMT activity, appear to be prerequisites for most of these effects. Based on these findings, we explored the potential for novel RMS therapeutic strategies, employing small-molecule compounds to enhance Smyd1 activity. In particular, we tested manipulation of (a) Smyd1 sumoylation, (b) stability of H3K4me2/3 marks, and (c) calpain activity, with calpains being important targets of Smyd1 in myogenesis. We found that specifically the last strategy might represent a promising approach, given that suitable small-molecule compounds will be available for clinical use in the future."

OBJECTIVE Perfusion index has shown to be helpful in the operative and critical care settings to monitor peripheral tissue perfusion. Randomised controlled trials quantifying different agents' vasodilatory properties using perfusion index has been limited. Therefore, we undertook this study to compare the vasodilatory effects of isoflurane and sevoflurane using perfusion index. METHODS This is a pre-specified sub-analysis of a prospective randomised controlled trial on the effects of inhalational agents at equipotent concentration. We randomly allocated patients scheduled for lumbar spine surgery to either isoflurane or sevoflurane groups. We recorded values of perfusion index at age-corrected 1 Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC) concentration at baseline, pre- and post-application of a noxious stimulus. The primary outcome of interest was the measure of vasomotor tone with perfusion index, and the secondary outcomes which were analysed were mean arterial pressure and heart rate. RESULTS At age-corrected 1.0 MAC, there was no significant difference in the pre-stimulus haemodynamic variables and perfusion index between both groups. During the post-stimulus period, there was a significant increase in heart rate in the isoflurane group compared to the sevoflurane group, with no significant difference in the mean arterial pressure values between both groups. Though the perfusion index decreased during the post-stimulus period in both groups, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .526, repeated-measures analysis of variance). CONCLUSION In a steady state of age-corrected 1.0 MAC, isoflurane and sevoflurane had a similar perfusion index before and after a standardised nociceptive stimulus, which suggests that both of these agents have similar effect on peripheral perfusion and vasomotor tone."

BACKGROUND Xenon has minimal haemodynamic side effects when compared to volatile or intravenous anaesthetics. Moreover, in in vitro and in animal experiments, xenon has been demonstrated to convey cardio- and neuroprotective effects. Neuroprotection could be advantageous in paediatric anaesthesia as there is growing concern, based on both laboratory studies and retrospective human clinical studies, that anaesthetics may trigger an injury in the developing brain, resulting in long-lasting neurodevelopmental consequences. Furthermore, xenon-mediated neuroprotection could help to prevent emergence delirium/agitation. Altogether, the beneficial haemodynamic profile combined with its putative organ-protective properties could render xenon an attractive option for anaesthesia of children undergoing cardiac catheterization. METHODS/DESIGN In a phase-II, mono-centre, prospective, single-blind, randomised, controlled study, we will test the hypothesis that the administration of 50% xenon as an adjuvant to general anaesthesia with sevoflurane in children undergoing elective cardiac catheterization is safe and feasible. Secondary aims include the evaluation of haemodynamic parameters during and after the procedure, emergence characteristics, and the analysis of peri-operative neuro-cognitive function. A total of 40 children ages 4 to 12 years will be recruited and randomised into two study groups, receiving either a combination of sevoflurane and xenon or sevoflurane alone. DISCUSSION Children undergoing diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization are a vulnerable patient population, one particularly at risk for intra-procedural haemodynamic instability. Xenon provides remarkable haemodynamic stability and potentially has cardio- and neuroprotective properties. Unfortunately, evidence is scarce on the use of xenon in the paediatric population. Our pilot study will therefore deliver important data required for prospective future clinical trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION EudraCT: 2014-002510-23 (5 September 2014)."

BACKGROUND An increasing number of studies have concluded that the number of adverse events in the upper airway caused by desflurane does not differ significantly from the number of adverse events caused by sevoflurane. The advantages of desflurane in ambulatory surgery should be reassessed. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare adverse respiratory events and recovery outcomes in patients undergoing desflurane or sevoflurane-based anaesthesia in ambulatory surgery. DESIGN A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). DATA SOURCES A systematic search for eligible RCTs in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ScienceDirect and Embase published up to June 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA RCTs investigating the occurrence of adverse respiratory events, including airway irritation, stridor, coughing, respiratory distress and laryngospasm, emergence agitation, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), time to eye opening and time to discharge from the operation room after desflurane or sevoflurane-based anaesthesia. RESULTS Thirteen trials were included and analysed. A total of 634 patients were included in the desflurane group, and 633 patients in the sevoflurane group. The occurrence of respiratory complications was significantly higher with desflurane-based anaesthesia than with sevoflurane-based anaesthesia (Total n = 673, 20.0 vs. 12.8%, relative risk (RR) 1.59 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.20)) with low heterogeneity (I = 20%). There was no difference in the occurrence of emergence agitation (Total n = 626, 29.1 vs. 27.2%, RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.30)) or the incidence of PONV between the desflurane and sevoflurane groups (Total n = 989, 19.0 vs. 21.0%, RR 0.95 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.26)). Time to eye opening was significantly faster with desflurane than that with sevoflurane (Total n = 1072, mean difference = -3.32 min (95% CI -4.02 to -2.61)) with a substantial heterogeneity (I = 72.6%). There was no significant difference in the time to discharge from the operation room between the two groups (Total n = 1056, mean difference = -0.45 min (95% CI -5.89 to 4.99)). CONCLUSION Despite recent reports that there is no significant difference in adverse respiratory events between desflurane and sevoflurane, a pooled analysis revealed that desflurane resulted in a higher rate than sevoflurane. Therefore, the consequences of desflurane should not be neglected and its airway irritant properties should be taken into account. TRIAL REGISTRATION PROSPERO (CRD42019147939)."

BACKGROUND Emergence delirium is a common complication in paediatric anaesthesia associated with significant morbidity. Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and intra-operative dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to sevoflurane anaesthesia can both reduce the incidence of emergence delirium compared with sevoflurane alone, but no studies have directly compared their relative efficacy. OBJECTIVE The study objective was to compare the effects of TIVA and dexmedetomidine on the incidence of paediatric emergence delirium. STUDY DESIGN The current study is a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES We conducted a systematic search of 12 databases including Medline (Ovid) and Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) from their respective inception to December 2020. ELIGIBILITY Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials of paediatric patients undergoing general anaesthesia using sevoflurane, sevoflurane with dexmedetomidine or TIVA. Data were extracted by two reviewers according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines and analysed using NMA methodology. Risk ratios and 95% credible intervals (CrI) were calculated for all outcomes [emergence delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and time to emergence and extubation]. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018091237). RESULTS The systematic review returned 66 eligible studies comprising 5257 patients with crude median emergence delirium incidences of 12.8, 9.1 and 40% in the dexmedetomidine with sevoflurane, TIVA and sevoflurane alone groups, respectively. NMA indicated that compared with TIVA, sevoflurane with adjuvant dexmedetomidine decreased the incidence of emergence delirium without statistical difference (risk ratio 0.88, 95% CrI 0.61 to 1.20, low quality of evidence), but resulted in a higher incidence of PONV (risk ratio: 2.3, 95% CrI 1.1 to 5.6, low quality of evidence). CONCLUSION Clinical judgement, considering the patient's risk factors for the development of clinically significant outcomes such as emergence delirium and PONV, should be used when choosing between TIVA and sevoflurane with adjuvant dexmedetomidine. These findings are limited by the low quality of evidence (conditional recommendation)."

Objective: Inflammatory cytokines are increased during one-lung ventilation in patients undergoing lung resection, and this increase can be fatal. Propofol and sevoflurane are the main anesthetics used for these patients. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on the best choice of an anesthetic agent concerning an inflammatory response in patients undergoing lung resection. This meta-analysis aimed to compare the effects of propofol and sevoflurane on the inflammatory response in patients undergoing lung resection. Methods: We searched electronic databases to identify randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of different anesthetics (sevoflurane vs. propofol) on the inflammatory response. The primary outcome concerned the concentration of systemic inflammatory cytokines. The secondary outcomes concerned the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from the dependent and independent lung. Random effects analysis of the meta-analyses were performed to synthesize the evidence and to assess the concentrations of inflammatory factors in the sevoflurane and propofol groups. Results: Eight trials involving 488 participants undergoing lung resection with one-lung ventilation were included. There was no significant difference in the concentrations of systemic interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, or tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 between the sevoflurane and propofol groups. Compared with the propofol group, BAL levels of IL-6 in the dependent ventilated lung were decreased in the sevoflurane group (three trials, 256 participants; standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.90 to -0.11; p = 0.01; I 2 = 46%). The BAL levels of IL-6 in the independent ventilated lung were also decreased by sevoflurane (four trials, 362 participants; SMD, -0.70; 95% [CI], -0.93 to -0.47; p < 0.00001; I 2 = 0%). Conclusions: There was no difference in the systemic inflammatory response between the sevoflurane and propofol groups. However, compared with propofol, sevoflurane can reduce the local alveolar inflammatory response. Additional research is necessary to confirm whether the inflammatory response is direct or indirect."

BACKGROUND The effect of anesthetic drugs on cancer outcomes remains unclear. This trial aimed to assess postoperative circulating tumor cell counts-an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer-to determine how anesthesia may indirectly affect prognosis. It was hypothesized that patients receiving sevoflurane would have higher postoperative tumor cell counts. METHODS The parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted in two centers in Switzerland. Patients aged 18 to 85 yr without metastases and scheduled for primary breast cancer surgery were eligible. The patients were randomly assigned to either sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia. The patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was circulating tumor cell counts over time, assessed at three time points postoperatively (0, 48, and 72 h) by the CellSearch assay. Secondary outcomes included maximal circulating tumor cells value, positivity (cutoff: at least 1 and at least 5 tumor cells/7.5 ml blood), and the association between natural killer cell activity and tumor cell counts. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02005770). RESULTS Between March 2014 and April 2018, 210 participants were enrolled, assigned to sevoflurane (n = 107) or propofol (n = 103) anesthesia, and eventually included in the analysis. Anesthesia type did not affect circulating tumor cell counts over time (median circulating tumor cell count [interquartile range]; for propofol: 1 [0 to 4] at 0 h, 1 [0 to 2] at 48 h, and 0 [0 to 1] at 72 h; and for sevoflurane: 1 [0 to 4] at 0 h, 0 [0 to 2] at 48 h, and 1 [0 to 2] at 72 h; rate ratio, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.95 to 1.71]; P = 0.103) or positivity. In one secondary analysis, administrating sevoflurane led to a significant increase in maximal tumor cell counts postoperatively. There was no association between natural killer cell activity and circulating tumor cell counts. CONCLUSIONS In this randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of anesthesia on an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer, there was no difference between sevoflurane and propofol with respect to circulating tumor cell counts over time."

This means we wanted to know their opinions about the way randomised controlled trials are done, such as how people are chosen to be in the study and how the study is carried out. We did this by talking to 49 autistic adults individually and asking them questions. We found that most of the people we talked to were okay with the way randomised controlled trials are done. They thought it was fair and they liked that it was based on evidence. However, some autistic people might find it hard to take part in randomised controlled trials. Some people did not like the uncertainty of not knowing what treatment they would receive in a randomised controlled trial. Others felt too vulnerable and may have had bad experiences with healthcare in the past. We found that it is important to involve autistic people early on and at every stage when designing a clinical trial.

BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, increases the risk of cognitive impairment, and adversely affects cardiovascular haemodynamics. Electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation has been in use since the 1960s; the rationale is that restoration of sinus rhythm improves cardiovascular haemodynamics, reduces the risk of stroke, and obviates the need for long-term anticoagulation. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter on the annual risk of thromboembolic events, strokes and mortality (primary outcomes measures), the rate of cognitive decline, quality of life, the use of anticoagulants and the risk of re-hospitalisation (secondary outcome measures) in adults (>18 years) with acute, paroxysmal or sustained atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, of any duration and any aetiology. SEARCH STRATEGY One reviewer searched the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register (2000 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2000), EMBASE (1980 to December 2000), CINAHL (1982 to November 2000) and proceedings of the American College of Cardiology (published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology 1983 to 2000).

We reported a fetus diagnosed with Meier-Gorlin syndrome 7. The antenatal sonographic images were presented, and compound heterozygous mutations of CDC45 on chromosome 22 were identified by whole-exome sequencing (WES). CASE PRESENTATION Fetal growth restriction (FGR), craniosynostosis, and brachydactyly of right thumb were found in a fetus of 28th gestational weeks. The fetus was diagnosed as MGS7 clinically. After extensive counseling, the couple opted for prenatal diagnosis by cordocentesis and termination of pregnancy. Karyotype analysis and WES were performed. Chromosomal karyotyping showed that the fetus was 46, XY. There were 2 mutations of CDC45, the causal gene of MGS7 on chromosome 22, which were inherited from the couple respectively were identified by WES. Facial dysmorphism, brachydactyly of right thumb, and genitalia abnormally were proved by postpartum autopsy, and craniosynostosis was confirmed by three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS It is possible to detect multiple clinical features of Meier-Gorlin syndrome in prenatal sonography. Deteriorative FGR complicated with craniosynostosis indicates MGS7. Combination of 2D and 3D ultrasonography helps to detect craniosynostosis. The affected fetus was confirmed a compound heterozygote of CDC45 related MGS by whole-exome sequencing, which is critical in identifying rare genetic diseases."

Meier-Gorlin syndrome is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder of growth retardation, accompanied by microtia and patellae a/hypoplasia and characteristic facies. Pathogenic variants in genes associated with the initiation of DNA replication underlie the condition, with biallelic variants in CDT1 the most common cause. Using 10\u00d7 Chromium genome sequencing, we report CDT1 variants in an adult female, with an inframe amino acid deletion inherited in trans with a deep intronic variant which likely serves as the branchpoint site in Intron 8. Splicing defects arising from this variant were confirmed through in vitro analysis. At 49 years, she represents the oldest patient with a molecular diagnosis described in the literature and is the first reported patient with Meier-Gorlin syndrome to have carried a successful pregnancy to term. Both of her pregnancies were complicated by postpartum hemorrhage and upon subsequent necessary hysterectomy, revealed uterine abnormalities. There is scant knowledge on reproductive ability and success in patients with Meier-Gorlin syndrome. Successful pregnancies among other clinically recognizable forms of primordial dwarfism have also not been described previously.

Like DNA replication, centrosomes are licensed to duplicate once per cell division cycle to ensure genetic stability. In addition to regulating DNA replication, the Orc1 subunit of the human origin recognition complex controls centriole and centrosome copy number. Here we report that Orc1 harbors a PACT centrosome-targeting domain and a separate domain that differentially inhibits the protein kinase activities of Cyclin E-CDK2 and Cyclin A-CDK2. A cyclin-binding motif (Cy motif) is required for Orc1 to bind Cyclin A and inhibit Cyclin A-CDK2 kinase activity but has no effect on Cyclin E-CDK2 kinase activity. In contrast, Orc1 inhibition of Cyclin E-CDK2 kinase activity occurs by a different mechanism that is affected by Orc1 mutations identified in Meier-Gorlin syndrome patients. The cyclin/CDK2 kinase inhibitory domain of Orc1, when tethered to the PACT domain, localizes to centrosomes and blocks centrosome reduplication. Meier-Gorlin syndrome mutations that disrupt Cyclin E-CDK2 kinase inhibition also allow centrosome reduplication. Thus, Orc1 contains distinct domains that control centrosome copy number and DNA replication. We suggest that the Orc1 mutations present in some Meier-Gorlin syndrome patients contribute to the pronounced microcephaly and dwarfism observed in these individuals by altering centrosome duplication in addition to DNA replication defects."

MOTIVATION Many important biological processes such as cell signaling, transport of membrane-impermeable molecules, cell-cell communication, cell recognition and cell adhesion are mediated by membrane proteins. Unfortunately, as these proteins are not water soluble, it is extremely hard to experimentally determine their structure. Therefore, improved methods for predicting the structure of these proteins are vital in biological research. In order to improve transmembrane topology prediction, we evaluate the combined use of both integrated signal peptide prediction and evolutionary information in a single algorithm. RESULTS A new method (MEMSAT3) for predicting transmembrane protein topology from sequence profiles is described and benchmarked with full cross-validation on a standard data set of 184 transmembrane proteins. The method is found to predict both the correct topology and the locations of transmembrane segments for 80% of the test set. This compares with accuracies of 62-72% for other popular methods on the same benchmark. By using a second neural network specifically to discriminate transmembrane from globular proteins, a very low overall false positive rate (0.5%) can also be achieved in detecting transmembrane proteins.

Alpha helix transmembrane proteins (\u03b1TMPs) represent roughly 30% of all open reading frames (ORFs) in a typical genome and are involved in many critical biological processes. Due to the special physicochemical properties, it is hard to crystallize and obtain high resolution structures experimentally, thus, sequence-based topology prediction is highly desirable for the study of transmembrane proteins (TMPs), both in structure prediction and function prediction. Various model-based topology prediction methods have been developed, but the accuracy of those individual predictors remain poor due to the limitation of the methods or the features they used. Thus, the consensus topology prediction method becomes practical for high accuracy applications by combining the advances of the individual predictors. Here, based on the observation that inter-helical interactions are commonly found within the transmembrane helixes (TMHs) and strongly indicate the existence of them, we present a novel consensus topology prediction method for \u03b1TMPs, CNTOP, which incorporates four top leading individual topology predictors, and further improves the prediction accuracy by using the predicted inter-helical interactions. The method achieved 87% prediction accuracy based on a benchmark dataset and 78% accuracy based on a non-redundant dataset which is composed of polytopic \u03b1TMPs. Our method derives the highest topology accuracy than any other individual predictors and consensus predictors, at the same time, the TMHs are more accurately predicted in their length and locations, where both the false positives (FPs) and the false negatives (FNs) decreased dramatically.

During the last two decades a large number of computational methods have been developed for predicting transmembrane protein topology. Current predictors rely on topogenic signals in the protein sequence, such as the distribution of positively charged residues in extra-membrane loops and the existence of N-terminal signals. However, phosphorylation and glycosylation are post-translational modifications (PTMs) that occur in a compartment-specific manner and therefore the presence of a phosphorylation or glycosylation site in a transmembrane protein provides topological information. We examine the combination of phosphorylation and glycosylation site prediction with transmembrane protein topology prediction.

BACKGROUND Transmembrane proteins have important roles in cells, as they are involved in energy production, signal transduction, cell-cell interaction, cell-cell communication and more. In human cells, they are frequently targets for pharmaceuticals; therefore, knowledge about their properties and structure is crucial. Topology of transmembrane proteins provide a low resolution structural information, which can be a starting point for either laboratory experiments or modelling their 3D structures. RESULTS Here, we present a database of the human \u03b1-helical transmembrane proteome, including the predicted and/or experimentally established topology of each transmembrane protein, together with the reliability of the prediction. In order to distinguish transmembrane proteins in the proteome as well as for topology prediction, we used a newly developed consensus method (CCTOP) that incorporates recent state of the art methods, with tested accuracies on a novel human benchmark protein set. CCTOP utilizes all available structure and topology data as well as bioinformatical evidences for topology prediction in a probabilistic framework provided by the hidden Markov model. This method shows the highest accuracy (98.5 % for discrinimating between transmembrane and non-transmembrane proteins and 84 % for per protein topology prediction) among the dozen tested topology prediction methods. Analysis of the human proteome with the CCTOP indicates that it contains 4998 (26 %) transmembrane proteins. Besides predicting topology, reliability of the predictions is estimated as well, and it is demonstrated that the per protein prediction accuracies of more than 60 % of the predictions are over 98 % on the benchmark sets and most probably on the predicted human transmembrane proteome too.

A hidden Markov model with special architecture was developed to search transmembrane topology corresponding to the maximum likelihood among all the possible topologies of a given protein.

A lactotroph adenoma has been described in one dog, while gonadotroph, thyrotroph and null cell adenomas have not been described in dogs or cats. Hormonally silent adenomas are likely underdiagnosed because they do not result in an endocrine syndrome. Tools used to classify pituitary tumours in humans, particularly immunohistochemistry for lineage-specific transcription factors, are likely to be useful to classify canine and feline pituitary tumours of unknown origin. Future studies are required to better understand the full range of pituitary adenoma pathology in dogs and cats and to determine whether certain adenoma subtypes behave more aggressively than others. Currently, the mechanisms that underlie pituitary tumorigenesis in dogs and cats are still largely unknown. A better understanding of the molecular background of these tumours could help to identify improved pituitary-targeted therapeutics."

Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia, decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines. We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p. thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v. (0.5 mg/kg) bolus infusion of T(1)AM, T(0)AM, or vehicle. To identify the peripheral effects of centrally administered thyronamines, drug-naive rats were also infused intravenously with low dose (0.5 mg/kg) thyronamines. Systemic T(1)AM rapidly increased EGP and plasma glucose, increased plasma glucagon, and corticosterone, but failed to change plasma insulin. Compared with i.p.-administered T(1)AM, a 100-fold lower dose administered centrally induced a more pronounced acute EGP increase and hyperglucagonemia while plasma insulin tended to decrease. Both systemic and central infusions of T(0)AM caused smaller increases in EGP, plasma glucose, and glucagon compared with T(1)AM. Neither T(1)AM nor T(0)AM influenced any of these parameters upon low dose i.v. administration. We conclude that central administration of low-dose thyronamines suffices to induce the acute alterations in glucoregulatory hormones and glucose metabolism following systemic thyronamine infusion. Our data indicate that thyronamines can act centrally to modulate glucose metabolism."

Their classical mechanism of action is genomic. Recent findings have broadened our knowledge about the (patho)physiology of cardiac regulation by THs, to include non-genomic actions of THs and their metabolites (THM). This review provides an overview of classical and non-classical cardiac effects controlled by: i) iodothyronines (thyroxine, T4; 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine,T3; 3, 5-diiodothyronine, T2); ii) thyronamines (thyronamine, T0AM; 3-iodothyronamine, T1AM); and iii) iodothyroacetic acids (3, 5, 3', 5'-tetraiodothyroacetic acid, tetrac; 3, 5, 3'-triiodothyroacetic acid, triac; 3-iodothyroacetic acid, TA1). Whereas iodothyronines enhance both diastolic and systolic function and heart rate, thyronamines were observed to have negative inotropic and chronotropic effects and might function as a brake with respect to THs, although their physiological role is unclear. Moreover, thyronamines showed a cardioprotective effect at physiological concentrations. The cardiac effects of iodothyroacetic acids seem to be limited and need to be elucidated."

Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), 3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities. We characterized several biochemical properties of SULTs using the thyronamines that acted as substrates for SULT activities in a human liver high-speed supernatant pool (n=3). T1AM led to the highest SULT activity. Activities with T0AM and T3AM were 10-fold lower, and there was no detectable activity with T2AM. Thyronamines were then tested as substrates with eight cDNA-expressed SULTs (1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1C2, 1E1, 2A1, 2B1a, and 2B1b). Expressed SULT1A3 had the greatest activity with T0AM, T1AM, and T3AM, whereas SULT1A1 showed similar activity only with T3AM. Expressed SULT1E1 had low activity with each substrate. T1AM, the most active thyronamine pharmacologically, was associated with the greatest SULT activity of the thyronamines tested in the liver pool and in both the expressed SULT1A3 and SULT1E1 preparations. Our results support the conclusion that sulfation contributes to the metabolism of thyronamines in human liver and that SULT activities may regulate the physiological effects of endogenous thyronamines."

Since the mitochondrial energy-transduction apparatus is known to be a potential target of thyroid hormone and its derivatives, we investigated the in vitro effects of T(0)AM and T(1)AM on the rates of O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone action."

We review the evidence regarding the nongenomic (or non-canonical) actions of thyroid hormones (thyronines) and their derivatives (including thyronamines and thyroacetic acids) in the adult brain. The paper seeks to evaluate these compounds for consideration as candidate neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are defined by their (a) presence in the neural tissue, (b) release from neural tissue or cell, (c) binding to high-affinity and saturable recognition sites, (d) triggering of a specific effector mechanism and (e) inactivation mechanism. Thyronines and thyronamines are concentrated in brain tissue and show distinctive patterns of distribution within the brain. Nerve terminals accumulate a large amount of thyroid hormones in mature brain, suggesting a synaptic function. However, surprisingly little is known about the potential release of thyroid hormones at synapses. There are specific binding sites for thyroid hormones in nerve-terminal fractions (synaptosomes). A notable cell-membrane binding site for thyroid hormones is integrin \u03b1v\u03b23. Furthermore, thyronines bind specifically to other defined neurotransmitter receptors, including GABAergic, catecholaminergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic and cholinergic systems. Here, the thyronines tend to bind to sites other than the primary sites and have allosteric effects. Thyronamines also bind to specific membrane receptors, including the trace amine associated receptors (TAARs), especially TAAR1. The thyronines and thyronamines activate specific effector mechanisms that are short in latency and often occur in subcellular fractions lacking nuclei, suggesting nongenomic actions. Some of the effector mechanisms for thyronines include effects on protein phosphorylation, Na+/K+ ATPase, and behavioral measures such as sleep regulation and measures of memory retention. Thyronamines promptly regulate body temperature. Lastly, there are numerous inactivation mechanisms for the hormones, including decarboxylation, deiodination, oxidative deamination, glucuronidation, sulfation and acetylation. Therefore, at the current state of the research field, thyroid hormones and their derivatives satisfy most, but not all, of the criteria for definition as neurotransmitters."

TAAR1 and other receptors of this family are expressed in several tissues, including the heart.

Their proposed biosynthesis from thyroid hormones would require decarboxylation and more or less extensive deiodination. Deiodinases (Dio1, Dio2, and Dio3) catalyze the removal of iodine from their substrates. Because a role of deiodinases in thyronamine biosynthesis requires their ability to accept thyronamines as substrates, we investigated whether thyronamines are converted by deiodinases. Thyronamines were incubated with isozyme-specific deiodinase preparations. Deiodination products were analyzed using a newly established method applying liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Phenolic ring deiodinations of 3,3',5'-triiodothyronamine (rT3AM), 3',5'-diiodothyronamine (3',5'-T2AM), and 3,3'-diiodothyronamine (3,3'-T2AM) as well as tyrosyl ring deiodinations of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) and 3,5-diiodothyronamine (3,5-T2AM) were observed with Dio1. These reactions were completely inhibited by the Dio1-specific inhibitor 6n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU). Dio2 containing preparations also deiodinated rT(3)AM and 3',5'-T2AM at the phenolic rings but in a PTU-insensitive fashion. All thyronamines with tyrosyl ring iodine atoms were 5(3)-deiodinated by Dio3-containing preparations. In functional competition assays, the newly identified thyronamine substrates inhibited an established iodothyronine deiodination reaction. By contrast, thyronamines that had been excluded as deiodinase substrates in LC-MS/MS experiments failed to show any effect in the competition assays, thus verifying the former results. These data support a role for deiodinases in thyronamine biosynthesis and contribute to confining the biosynthetic pathways for 3-T 1 AM and T 0 AM."

Alternatively, 3-T1AM might be formed by the thyroid gland and secreted into the blood. 3-T1AM and T0AM concentrations have been determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS) in tissues, serum, and cell lines. However, large variations of 3-T1AM concentrations in human serum were reported by LC-MS/MS compared with a monoclonal antibody-based immunoassay. These differences might be caused by strong binding of the highly hydrophobic 3-T1AM to apolipoprotein B100. Pharmacological administration of 3-T1AM results in dose-dependent reversible effects on body temperature, cardiac function, energy metabolism, and neurological functions. The physiological relevance of these actions is unclear, but may occur at tissue concentrations close to the estimated endogenous concentrations of 3-T1AM or its metabolites T0AM or thyroacetic acid (TA1). A number of putative receptors, binding sites, and cellular target molecules mediating actions of the multi-target ligand 3-T1AM have been proposed.

For this reason, the effective use of microRNA profiling for the rapid analysis of prenatal amniotic fluid samples for the diagnosis of Down syndrome was investigated. AIMS To evaluate the expression levels of 14 microRNAs encoded by chromosome 21 in amniotic fluid samples and their utility for prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. STUDY DESIGN Case-control study. METHODS We performed invasive prenatal testing for 56 pregnant women; 23 carried fetuses with Down syndrome, and 33 carried fetuses with a normal karyotype. Advanced maternal age and increased risk for Down syndrome in the screening tests were indications for invasive prenatal testing. The age of gestation in the study and control groups ranged between 17 and 18 weeks. The expression levels of microRNA were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS The expression levels of microRNA-125b-2, microRNA-155, and microRNA-3156 were significantly higher in the study group than in the control group.

STUDY DESIGN For the years 1989 through 1999, England and Wales were divided into geographically defined areas where specific hospitals, health authorities, and cytogenetic laboratories provided maternity care for well-defined populations. For each year from 1989 through 1999, the dominant Down syndrome screening method that was used in each area was determined. Outcomes for area-years that used serum biochemistry or ultrasound (first or second trimester) were compared with area-years that used advanced maternal age as the dominant screening method. The percent of Down syndrome cases that were diagnosed prenatally (effectiveness) and the number of invasive prenatal tests that were performed to diagnose each Down syndrome case prenatally (efficiency) were compared. RESULTS There were 5,980,519 births and 335,184 referrals for prenatal karyotyping (amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling) that occurred in the area-years studied, of which 12,047 pregnancies were diagnosed as Down syndrome; 5393 cases of Down syndrome (45%) were diagnosed prenatally. Invasive testing increased from 4.4% of pregnancies in 1989 to 6.4% in 1997 and declined slightly in 1999 (5.8%). Prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome cases rose from 28% in 1989 to 53% in 1999, and the number of invasive tests that were performed to diagnose each Down syndrome case fell from 89.7 to 47.7 (P [for trend]<.0001). Areas with serum or ultrasound as the dominant screening method detected 50% more Down syndrome cases in prenatally (52% and 53% vs 36%; P<.0001) and performed fewer invasive procedures to diagnose each Down syndrome case (60.7 and 52.0 vs 88.0; P<.0001) compared with areas in which advanced maternal age screening was dominant, despite serving populations with similar mean/median maternal ages. CONCLUSION In clinical practice, screening programs for Down syndrome that were based on maternal serum biochemistry or ultrasound were more effective and efficient than the screening programs that used advanced maternal age alone."

Fathers retrospectively contrasted these attitudes with the actual reality of raising their children with Down syndrome, which they described as bringing joy to their lives. Findings suggest that although fathers valued NIPT as an information-giving tool that allowed autonomous parental choices about the pregnancy, they believe that it should be accompanied by balanced information about the reality of raising a child with Down syndrome."

OBJECTIVE To assess the practical and health economical values of non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) in Changsha Municipal Public Welfare Program. METHODS A retrospective analysis was carried out on 149 165 women undergoing NIPT test from April 9, 2018 to December 31, 2019. For pregnant women with high risks, invasive prenatal diagnosis and follow-up of pregnancy outcome were conducted. The cost-benefit of NIPT for Down syndrome was analyzed. RESULTS NIPT was carried out for 149 165 pregnant women and succeeded in 148 749 cases (99.72%), for which outcome were available in 148 538 (99.86%). 90% of pregnant women from the region accepted the screening with NIPT. 415 (0.27%) were diagnosed as high risk. Among these, 381 (91.81%) accepted amniocentesis, which led to the diagnosis of 212 cases of trisomy 21 (PPV=85.14%), 41 cases with trisomy 18 (PPV=48.81%) and 10 cases with trisomy 13 (PPV=20.83%). The sensitivity and specificity of NIPT for trisomy 21, trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 were (97.70%, 99.98%), (97.62%, 9.97%) and (100%, 99.97%), respectively. In addition, 213 and 30 cases were diagnosed with sex chromosomal aneuploidies (PPV=46.2%) and other autosomal anomalies (PPV=16.57%), respectively. For Down syndrome screening, the cost and benefit of the project was 120.79 million yuan and 1,056.95 million yuan, respectively. The cost-benefit ratio was 1: 8.75, and safety index was 0.0035. CONCLUSION NIPT is a highly accurate screening test for trisomy 21, which was followed by trisomy 18 and sex chromosomal aneuploidies, while it was less accurate for other autosomal aneuploidies. The application of NIPT screening has a high health economical value."

Non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) has the potential to dramatically increase the prenatal detection rate of Down syndrome because of improvements in safety and accuracy over existing tests. There is concern that NIPS could lead to more negative attitudes towards Down syndrome and less support for individuals with Down syndrome. To assess the impact of NIPS on support for prenatal testing, decision-making about testing, and beliefs or attitudes about Down syndrome, we performed an Internet-based experiment using adults (N = 1,789) recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants were randomly assigned to read a mock news article about NIPS, a mock news article about amniocentesis, or no article. The content in the two articles varied only in their descriptions of the test characteristics. Participants then answered questions about their support for testing, hypothetical testing decision, and beliefs and attitudes about Down syndrome. Reading the mock NIPS news article predicted increased hypothetical test uptake. In addition, the NIPS article group also agreed more strongly that pregnant women, in general, should utilize prenatal testing. We also found that the more strongly participants supported prenatal testing for pregnant women, the less favorable their attitudes towards individuals with Down syndrome; providing some evidence that NIPS may indirectly result in more negative perceptions of individuals with this diagnosis."

In vertebrates, conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) are functionally constrained sequences that can show striking conservation over >400 million years of evolutionary distance and frequently are located megabases away from target developmental genes. Conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in plants are much shorter, and it has been difficult to detect conservation among distantly related genomes. In this article, we show not only that CNS sequences can be detected throughout the eudicot clade of flowering plants, but also that a subset of 37 CNSs can be found in all flowering plants (diverging \u223c170 million years ago). These CNSs are functionally similar to vertebrate CNEs, being highly associated with transcription factor and development genes and enriched in transcription factor binding sites. Some of the most highly conserved sequences occur in genes encoding RNA binding proteins, particularly the RNA splicing-associated SR genes. Differences in sequence conservation between plants and animals are likely to reflect differences in the biology of the organisms, with plants being much more able to tolerate genomic deletions and whole-genome duplication events due, in part, to their far greater fecundity compared with vertebrates."

To more effectively identify CNEs with potential regulatory functions, we compared noncoding sequences of genomes of the most phylogenetically distant cephalochordate genera, Asymmetron and Branchiostoma, which diverged approximately 120-160 million years ago. We found 113,070 noncoding elements conserved between the two species, amounting to 3.3% of the genome. The genomic distribution, target gene ontology, and enriched motifs of these CNEs all suggest that many of them are probably cis-regulatory elements. More than 90% of previously verified amphioxus regulatory elements were re-captured in this study. A search of the cephalochordate CNEs around 50 developmental genes in several vertebrate genomes revealed eight CNEs conserved between cephalochordates and vertebrates, indicating sequence conservation over >500 million years of divergence. The function of five CNEs was tested in reporter assays in zebrafish, and one was also tested in amphioxus. All five CNEs proved to be tissue-specific enhancers. Taken together, these findings indicate that even though Branchiostoma and Asymmetron are distantly related, as they are evolving slowly, comparisons between them are likely optimal for identifying most of their tissue-specific cis-regulatory elements laying the foundation for functional characterizations and a better understanding of the evolution of developmental regulation in cephalochordates."

Clusters of CNEs define the span of regulatory inputs for many important developmental regulators and have been described previously as genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs).

BACKGROUND Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene transcription and play pivotal roles in various biological processes such as development, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation and tumor suppression. Identifying cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes is a crucial step in understanding gene regulatory networks. To this end, we have used a comparative genomics approach to identify putative cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes in vertebrates. DESCRIPTION We have created a database named TFCONES (Transcription Factor Genes & Associated COnserved Noncoding ElementS) (http://tfcones.fugu-sg.org) which contains all human, mouse and fugu TF-encoding genes and conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) associated with them. The CNEs were identified by gene-by-gene alignments of orthologous TF-encoding gene loci using MLAGAN. We also predicted putative transcription factor binding sites within the CNEs. A significant proportion of human-fugu CNEs contain experimentally defined binding sites for transcriptional activators and repressors, indicating that a majority of the CNEs may function as transcriptional regulatory elements. The TF-encoding genes that are involved in nervous system development are generally enriched for human-fugu CNEs. Users can retrieve TF-encoding genes and their associated CNEs by conducting a keyword search or by selecting a family of DNA-binding proteins. CONCLUSION The conserved noncoding elements identified in TFCONES represent a catalog of highly prioritized putative cis-regulatory elements of TF-encoding genes and are candidates for functional assay."

Insect genomes contain larger blocks of conserved gene order (microsynteny) than would be expected under a random breakage model of chromosome evolution. We present evidence that microsynteny has been retained to keep large arrays of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) intact. These arrays span key developmental regulatory genes, forming genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers and HCNE arrays specify complex expression programs of their target genes. Here we present a comparison of five Drosophila genomes showing that HCNE density peaks centrally in large synteny blocks containing multiple genes. Besides developmental regulators that are likely targets of HCNE enhancers, HCNE arrays often span unrelated neighboring genes. We describe differences in core promoters between the target genes and the unrelated genes that offer an explanation for the differences in their responsiveness to enhancers. We show examples of a striking correspondence between boundaries of synteny blocks, HCNE arrays, and Polycomb binding regions, confirming that the synteny blocks correspond to regulatory domains. Although few noncoding elements are highly conserved between Drosophila and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, we find that A. gambiae regions orthologous to Drosophila GRBs contain an equivalent distribution of noncoding elements highly conserved in the yellow fever mosquito A\u00ebdes aegypti and coincide with regions of ancient microsynteny between Drosophila and mosquitoes. The structural and functional equivalence between insect and vertebrate GRBs marks them as an ancient feature of metazoan genomes and as a key to future studies of development and gene regulation."

Vertebrate genomes include gene regulatory elements in protein-noncoding regions. A part of gene regulatory elements are expected to be conserved according to their functional importance, so that evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) might be good candidates for those elements. In addition, paralogous CNSs, which are highly conserved among both orthologous loci and paralogous loci, have the possibility of controlling overlapping expression patterns of their adjacent paralogous protein-coding genes. The two-round whole-genome duplications (2R WGDs), which most probably occurred in the vertebrate common ancestors, generated large numbers of paralogous protein-coding genes and their regulatory elements. These events could contribute to the emergence of vertebrate features. However, the evolutionary history and influences of the 2R WGDs are still unclear, especially in noncoding regions. To address this issue, we identified paralogous CNSs. Region-focused Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search of each synteny block revealed 7,924 orthologous CNSs and 309 paralogous CNSs conserved among eight high-quality vertebrate genomes. Paralogous CNSs we found contained 115 previously reported ones and newly detected 194 ones. Through comparisons with VISTA Enhancer Browser and available ChIP-seq data, one-third (103) of paralogous CNSs detected in this study showed gene regulatory activity in the brain at several developmental stages. Their genomic locations are highly enriched near the transcription factor-coding regions, which are expressed in brain and neural systems. These results suggest that paralogous CNSs are conserved mainly because of maintaining gene expression in the vertebrate brain."

Some of the fastest evolving regions of the human genome are conserved noncoding elements with many human-specific DNA substitutions. These human accelerated regions (HARs) are enriched nearby regulatory genes, and several HARs function as developmental enhancers. To investigate if this evolutionary signature is unique to humans, we quantified evidence of accelerated substitutions in conserved genomic elements across multiple lineages and applied this approach simultaneously to the genomes of five apes: human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon. We find roughly similar numbers and genomic distributions of lineage-specific accelerated regions (linARs) in all five apes. In particular, apes share an enrichment of linARs in regulatory DNA nearby genes involved in development, especially transcription factors and other regulators. Many developmental loci harbor clusters of nonoverlapping linARs from multiple apes, suggesting that accelerated evolution in each species affected distinct regulatory elements that control a shared set of developmental pathways. Our statistical tests distinguish between GC-biased and unbiased accelerated substitution rates, allowing us to quantify the roles of different evolutionary forces in creating linARs. We find evidence of GC-biased gene conversion in each ape, but unbiased acceleration consistent with positive selection or loss of constraint is more common in all five lineages. It therefore appears that similar evolutionary processes created independent accelerated regions in the genomes of different apes, and that these lineage-specific changes to conserved noncoding sequences may have differentially altered expression of a core set of developmental genes across ape evolution."

BACKGROUND Genomic imprinting is an evolutionary conserved mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation in placental mammals that results in silencing of one of the parental alleles. In order to decipher interactions between allele-specific DNA methylation of imprinted genes and evolutionary conservation, we performed a genome-wide comparative investigation of genomic sequences and highly conserved elements of imprinted genes in human and mouse. RESULTS Evolutionarily conserved elements in imprinted regions differ from those associated with autosomal genes in various ways. Whereas for maternally expressed genes strong divergence of protein-encoding sequences is most prominent, paternally expressed genes exhibit substantial conservation of coding and noncoding sequences. Conserved elements in imprinted regions are marked by enrichment of CpG dinucleotides and low (TpG+CpA)/(2\u00b7CpG) ratios indicate reduced CpG deamination. Interestingly, paternally and maternally expressed genes can be distinguished by differences in G+C and CpG contents that might be associated with unusual epigenetic features. Especially noncoding conserved elements of paternally expressed genes are exceptionally G+C and CpG rich. In addition, we confirmed a frequent occurrence of intronic CpG islands and observed a decelerated degeneration of ancient LINE-1 repeats. We also found a moderate enrichment of YY1 and CTCF binding sites in imprinted regions and identified several short sequence motifs in highly conserved elements that might act as additional regulatory elements. CONCLUSIONS We discovered several novel conserved DNA features that might be related to allele-specific DNA methylation. Our results hint at reduced CpG deamination rates in imprinted regions, which affects mostly noncoding conserved elements of paternally expressed genes. Pronounced differences between maternally and paternally expressed genes imply specific modes of evolution as a result of differences in epigenetic features and a special response to selective pressure. In addition, our data support the potential role of intronic CpG islands as epigenetic key regulatory elements and suggest that evolutionary conserved LINE-1 elements fulfill regulatory functions in imprinted regions."

When given alone for hypertension, enalapril has efficacy comparable to that of thiazide diuretics and beta blockers. Side effects observed with enalapril have generally been minor.

Enalapril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with an established clinical profile. In patients with symptomatic heart failure, enalapril reduces overall mortality, death from progressive heart failure and hospitalisation rates. In those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, enalapril decreases the combined risk of death and development of heart failure, and the risk of death and hospitalisation. The effects of enalapril in reducing hospitalisation rates in symptomatic patients translate into net savings in healthcare costs in heart failure. Enalapril also produces modest benefits in quality-of-life (QOL) parameters in patients with symptomatic heart failure as shown in well controlled studies. Its effects appear similar to those of hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate. The influence of enalapril on quality of life in patients with asymptomatic disease is minimal but not deleterious. Enalapril generally either maintains or slightly improves quality of life from baseline in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The drug appears to have a QOL profile that is more favourable than that of propranolol and similar to those of most other comparator drugs, as assessed by subjective measures of quality of life. Clarification is required of its QOL profile relative to that of captopril, in view of conflicting results in the literature. The effects of enalapril on cognitive and psychomotor function appear to resemble those of comparator agents. Thus, enalapril has modest beneficial effects on the quality of life of patients with symptomatic heart failure, while generally maintaining quality of life in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction or mild to moderate hypertension. Enalapril is a cost-effective treatment in heart failure that would be expected to yield considerable cost savings in this therapeutic area."

It was randomized double-blind trial with LCZ696 (200 mg twice a day) and enalapril (10 mg twice a day). 8442 patients were enrolled with NYHA class II or III and left ventricular ejection fiction of 40% or less. Study drugs were added to other recommended medication. The trial was prematurely terminated after median follow-up of 27 months. The primary endpoint of the study was a combination of cardiovascular mortality and the first hospitalization for heart failure. LCZ696 drug, an inhibitor of angiotensin receptor and neprilysin (Arnie), has led to a reduction in the primary composite target by 20% (p <0.001). The treatment has decreased cardiovascular mortality by 20%, p <0.001 and hospitalization for worsening heart failure by 21%, p <0.001. LCZ696 has also decreased total mortality by 16%, p <0.001. The use of LCZ696 has been accompanied by frequent symptomatic hypotension and hypotension with a decrease in systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, however, LCZ696 was less often associated with an increase in serum creatinine and serum potassium than enalapril. In addition, cough has occurred less frequently after LCZ696 than after enalapril. Discontinuation of therapy occurred in 746 patients (17.8%) treated with LCZ696 and in 833 patients (19.8%) treated with enalapril (19.8%) (p = 0.02). PARADIGM-HF study has also shown superiority of LCZ696 compared to ACE inhibitors in stable outpatients with chronic systolic heart failure NYHA stages II and III. Therefore, LCZ696 is more effective than ACE inhibitors (and angiotensin receptor blockers). Moreover, it is well tolerated. LCZ696 seems to replace the ACE inhibitors in mentioned patients.

The aim of this review is to discuss factors that may have an impact on the implementation of these guidelines into clinical practice. The main limitation is that, based on the inclusion criteria of PARADIGM-HF, sacubitril/valsartan is not indicated in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction, although they may be the majority of the patients with heart failure. The trial enrolled ambulatory patients and thus start of sacubitril/valsartan is not indicated in those hospitalized for heart failure. A drug's tolerability may be limited by hypotension with, however, a lower rate of renal dysfunction, compared with enalapril. The cost of the new treatment is also an issue.

The diagnosis of LCNEC requires positive immunohistochemical staining with chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56, along with a morphological diagnosis, and insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) has been proposed as an additional marker but is still not an ideal or better marker. We investigated Musashi-1 as a novel immunohistochemical marker in 42 patients with SCLCs and 44 with LCNECs who underwent lung resection between 1998 and 2020 at our institution. We found Musashi-1 expression in 98% (41/42) SCLC and in 90% (40/44) LCNEC. These findings were similar to CD56 expression and superior to synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and INSM1.

BACKGROUND Adenocarcinoma ex-goblet cell carcinoid (AdexGCC) was considered a neuroendocrine adenocarcinoma, despite majority of tumor cells being negative for conventional neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin and synaptophysin. Recently, insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) has been identified as a novel neuroendocrine marker that is more sensitive than chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 in pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. METHODS We studied this marker in conjunction with chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 in 36 appendiceal AdexGCCs (21 primaries, 15 metastatic). RESULTS Primary AdexGCCs showed staining for INSM1, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 in 13/21 (62%), 18/21 (86%), 18/21 (86%), and 9/19 (47%) cases, respectively. However, the mean proportion of tumor cells stained for INSM1, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 was only 8.0% (median 1%, range 0-70%), 15.7% (median 2%, range 0-70%), 19.9% (median 5%, range 0-90%), and 5.6% (median 0%, range 0-50%), respectively. Metastatic AdexGCCs showed staining for INSM1, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 in 8/15 (53%), 11/15 (73%), 12/15 (80%), and 3/14 (21%) cases. The mean proportion of tumor cells stained for INSM1, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 in metastatic tumors was 1% (median 1%, range 0-3%), 12% (median 1%, range 0-85%), 17% (median 5%, range 0-85%), and 2% (median 0%, range 0-20%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Primary and metastatic AdexGCCs showed no difference in INSM1, chromogranin, synaptophysin, or CD56 staining.

BACKGROUND Lymphocytic colitis (LC) can be mistakenly diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In a previous study on IBS, some patients showed extremely high colonic chromogranin A cell density. Further examination of these patients showed that they suffered from LC. AIMS To investigate whether chromogranin A cell density is increased in LC patients and to examine the possibility of using this increase as a marker for the diagnosis of LC. METHODS Fifty-seven patients diagnosed with LC and 54 controls were included in the study. Biopsies from the right and left colon were obtained from both patients and controls, which were immunostained using the Avidin-biotin-complex method for chromogranin A, and cell density was quantified. RESULTS In both the right and left colon of patients with LC, the density of chromogranin A was significantly higher than in controls. This increase in chromogranin A cells occurs whether the number of these cells is expressed as number/mm(2) epithelium or as number/field. Chromogranin A cell density for the right and left colon expressed as number of cells/mm(2) epithelium or as cell number/field showed a high sensitivity and specificity as a diagnostic marker for LC. CONCLUSIONS Chromogranin A is a common marker for endocrine cells, and the present finding suggests that colonic hormones are involved in the pathophysiology of LC. The chromogranin cell density seems to be a good diagnostic marker with high sensitivity and specificity in both the right and left colon, thus sigmoidoscopy can be used in the diagnosis of LC using with this marker."

The intensity of staining of type I cells and the density of type II cells were assessed semiquantitatively (0 to 4+) in a total of 38 tumors. A total of 23 of 24 low-grade tumors (solitary, multiple, or associated with other neoplasms; 95.8%) contained type II cells immunoreactive with either S-100 protein or GFAP, and all were positive when S-100 protein and GFAP were used in combination. Five of the nine intermediate-grade (recurrent and/or locally aggressive) tumors were identified as glomus jugulare tumors (GJT). Three intermediate-grade GJTs were devoid of GFAP-reactive type II cells and four GJTs were negative for S-100 protein. Type II cells were identified in only one of five high-grade (malignant) paragangliomas and that tumor contained vanishingly rare cells that were weakly S-100 protein positive but GFAP negative. Sustentacular cell density and chief cell staining intensity were both inversely related to tumor grade. The most sensitive chief cell marker was NSE (92.1%), followed by chromogranin (84.2%). The least sensitive (73.0%) and specific marker was met-enkephalin. Combinations of NSE or chromogranin with met-enkephalin identified chief cells in all cases. Electron microscopy identified neurosecretory granule-containing chief cells, but was of less value in delineating sustentacular cells because of their scarcity and the absence of specific features. By comparison, immunohistochemistry was superior in identifying sustentacular cells. The use of an immunohistochemical panel, in addition to routine histology, can confirm the diagnosis of a paraganglioma and can give an indication of the likely prognosis for a patient."

Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1/KDM1A) has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in solid cancers and more recently in acute myeloid leukemia. However, the potential side effects of a LSD1-inhibitory therapy remain elusive. Here, we show, with a newly established conditional in vivo knockdown model, that LSD1 represents a central regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. LSD1 knockdown (LSD1-kd) expanded progenitor numbers by enhancing their proliferative behavior. LSD1-kd led to an extensive expansion of granulomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors. In contrast, terminal granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and platelet production were severely inhibited. The only exception was monopoiesis, which was promoted by LSD1 deficiency. Importantly, we showed that peripheral blood granulocytopenia, monocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were reversible after LSD1-kd termination. Extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis contributed to the phenotypic reversion, and progenitor populations remained expanded. LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b, Hoxa9 and Meis1, which are known regulators of the HSC/progenitor compartment. We also demonstrated that LSD1-kd abrogated Gfi1b-negative autoregulation by crossing LSD1-kd with Gfi1b:GFP mice. Taken together, our findings distinguish LSD1 as a critical regulator of hematopoiesis and point to severe, but reversible, side effects of a LSD1-targeted therapy."

However, perturbation of its activity often leads to T cell leukemia. Whether and how its transcriptional activities are regulated during hematopoiesis remains to be addressed. Here, we show that TAL1 is associated with histone demethylase complexes containing lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), RE1 silencing transcription factor corepressor (CoREST), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and histone deacetylase 2 in erythroleukemia and T cell leukemia cells. The enzymatic domain of LSD1 plays an important role in repressing the TAL1-directed transcription of GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kniase minimal promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with the rapid changes of TAL1-corepressor complex during differentiation, TAL1 recruits LSD1 to the silenced p4.2 promoter in undifferentiated, but not in differentiated, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in MEL cells resulted in derepression of the TAL1 target gene accompanied by increasing dimeH3K4 at the promoter region. Thus, our data revealed that histone lysine demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate TAL1-mediated transcription and suggest that the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs."

Autophagy is a physiological process, important for recycling of macromolecules and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Defective autophagy is associated with tumorigenesis and has a causative role in chemotherapy resistance in leukemia and in solid cancers. Here, we report that autophagy is regulated by the lysine-specific demethylase LSD1/KDM1A, an epigenetic marker whose overexpression is a feature of malignant neoplasia with an instrumental role in cancer development. In the present study, we determine that two different LSD1 inhibitors (TCP and SP2509) as well as selective ablation of LSD1 expression promote autophagy in neuroblastoma cells. At a mechanistic level, we show that LSD1 binds to the promoter region of Sestrin2 (SESN2), a critical regulator of mTORC1 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 triggers SESN2 expression that hampers mTORC1 activity, leading to enhanced autophagy. SESN2 overexpression suffices to promote autophagy in neuroblastoma cells, while loss of SESN2 expression reduces autophagy induced by LSD1 inhibition. Our findings elucidate a mechanism whereby LSD1 controls autophagy in neuroblastoma cells through SESN2 transcription regulation, and we suggest that pharmacological targeting of LSD1 may have effective therapeutic relevance in the control of autophagy in neuroblastoma."

The lysine specific demethylase-1 (LSD1/KDM1A), together with the JmjC domain-containing JMJD2A and JMJD2C proteins, have emerged as critical regulators of histone lysine methylation. The LSD1-JMJD2 complex functions as a transcriptional co-regulator of hormone activated androgen and estrogen receptors at specific gene promoters. LSD1 also regulates DNA methylation and p53 function. LSD1 is overexpressed in numerous cancers including prostate cancer through an unknown mechanism. We investigated expression of the LSD1 and JMJD2A in malignant human prostate specimens. We correlated LSD1 and JMJD2A expression with known mediators of prostate cancer progression: VEGF-A and cyclin A1. We show that elevated expression of LSD1, but not JMJD2A, correlates with prostate cancer recurrence and with increased VEGF-A expression. We show that functional depletion of LSD1 expression using siRNA in prostate cancer cells decreases VEGF-A and blocks androgen induced VEGF-A, PSA and Tmprss2 expression. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 reduces proliferation of both androgen dependent (LnCaP) and independent cell lines (LnCaP: C42, PC3). We show a direct mechanistic link between LSD1 over-expression and increased activity of pro-angiogenic pathways. New therapies targeting LSD1 activity should be useful in the treatment of hormone dependent and independent prostate cancer."

The stem cell protein SALL4 plays a critical role in hematopoiesis by regulating the cell fate. In primitive hematopoietic precursors, it activates or represses important genes via recruitment of various epigenetic factors such as DNA methyltransferases, and histone deacylases. Here, we demonstrate that LSD1, a histone lysine demethylase, also participates in the trans-repressive effects of SALL4. Based on luciferase assays, the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 is important in suppressing SALL4-mediated reporter transcription. In freshly isolated adult mouse bone marrows, both SALL4 and LSD1 proteins are preferentially expressed in undifferentiated progenitor cells and co-localize in the nuclei. Further sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that these two factors share the same binding sites at the promoter regions of important hematopoietic regulatory genes including EBF1, GATA1, and TNF. In addition, studies from both gain- and loss-of-function models revealed that SALL4 dynamically controls the binding levels of LSD1, which is accompanied by a reversely changed histone 3 dimethylated lysine 4 at the same promoter regions. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in hematopoietic precursor cells resulted in altered SALL4 downstream gene expression and increased cellular activity. Thus, our data revealed that histone demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate SALL4-mediated transcription, and the dynamic regulation of SALL4-associated epigenetic factors cooperatively modulates early hematopoietic precursor proliferation."

LSD1/KDM1A is a widely conserved lysine-specific demethylase that removes methyl groups from methylated proteins, mainly histone H3. We previously isolated the zebrafish LSD1 gene and demonstrated that it is required for primitive hematopoiesis. Recently, a neuron-specific splicing variant of LSD1 was found in mammals and its specific functions and substrate specificities were reported. To our surprise, zebrafish LSD1 cDNA, which we previously analyzed, was corresponded to the neuron-specific variant in mammals. In this study, we investigated the structures and expression of LSD1 splicing variants in zebrafish and found all 4 types of LSD1 isoforms: LSD1, LSD1+2al, LSD1+8al and LSD1+2al8al. Interestingly, LSD1+8al/LSD1+2al8al, which correspond to mammalian neuron-specific variants, expressed ubiquitously in zebrafish. We also performed phenotypic rescue experiments of a zebrafish LSD1 mutant (kdm1ait627) using human and zebrafish LSD1 variants to identify which variant is involved in primitive hematopoiesis. Unexpectedly, the overexpression of all types of human and zebrafish variants was able to rescue the hematopoietic phenotypes in LSD1 mutants. Furthermore, enzymatic-deficient LSD1K661A (human) and K638A (zebrafish) were also able to rescue the mutant phenotypes. These results suggest that the LSD1 functions in zebrafish primitive hematopoiesis are free from any splicing-dependent regulation or demethylation reaction."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancy characterized by the accumulation of incompletely differentiated progenitor cells (blasts) in the bone marrow and blood, and by suppression of normal hematopoiesis. It has recently become apparent that the AML genome is characterized by recurrent mutations and dysregulations in epigenetic regulators. These mutations frequently occur before the onset of full blown leukemia, at the pre-leukemic phase, and persist in residual disease that remains after therapeutic intervention, thus suggesting that targeting the AML epigenome may help to eradicate minimal residual disease and prevent relapse. Within the AML epigenome, lysine-specific demethylase 1 A (LSD1) is a histone demethylase that is found frequently overexpressed, albeit not mutated, in AML. LSD1 is a required constituent of critical transcription repressor complexes like CoREST and nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD), and abrogation of LSD1 expression results in impaired self-renewal and proliferation, and increased differentiation and apoptosis in AML models and primary cells, particularly in AMLs with MLL- and AML1-rearrangements, or erythroid and megakaryoblastic differentiation block. On this basis, a number of LSD1 inhibitors have been developed in the past decade, and few of them are currently being tested in clinical trials for patients with AML, along with other malignancies. To date, the most promising application of this therapeutic strategy appears to be combination therapy of LSD1 inhibitors with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to reactivate myeloid differentiation in cells that are not spontaneously susceptible to ATRA treatment. In this review, we provide an overview of LSD1 function in normal hematopoiesis and leukemia, and of the current clinical application of LSD1 inhibitors for the treatment of patients with AML."

Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1, KDM1A) functions as a transcriptional corepressor through demethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) but has a coactivator function on some genes through mechanisms that are unclear. We show that LSD1, interacting with CoREST, associates with and coactivates androgen receptor (AR) on a large fraction of androgen-stimulated genes. A subset of these AR/LSD1-associated enhancer sites have histone 3 threonine 6 phosphorylation (H3T6ph), and these sites are further enriched for androgen-stimulated genes. Significantly, despite its coactivator activity, LSD1 still mediates H3K4me2 demethylation at these androgen-stimulated enhancers. FOXA1 is also associated with LSD1 at AR-regulated enhancer sites, and a FOXA1 interaction with LSD1 enhances binding of both proteins at these sites. These findings show that LSD1 functions broadly as a regulator of AR function, that it maintains a transcriptional repression function at AR-regulated enhancers through H3K4 demethylation, and that it has a distinct AR-linked coactivator function mediated by demethylation of other substrates."

Epigenetic abnormalities play a vital role in the progression of ovarian cancer. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A) acts as an epigenetic regulator and is overexpressed in ovarian tumors. However, the upstream regulator of LSD1 expression in this cancer remains elusive. Here, we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling upregulates LSD1 protein levels in SKOV3 and HO8910 ovarian cancer cells overexpressing both LSD1 and the EGF receptor. This effect is correlated with a decrease in the dimethylation of H3K4, a major substrate of LSD1, in an LSD1-dependent manner. We also show that inhibition of PI3K/AKT, but not MEK, abolishes the EGF-induced upregulation of LSD1 and cell migration, indicating that the PI3K/PDK1/AKT pathway mediates the EGF-induced expression of LSD1 and cell migration. Significantly, LSD1 knockdown or inhibition of LSD1 activity impairs both intrinsic and EGF-induced cell migration in SKOV3 and HO8910 cells.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) functions as a transcriptional coregulator by modulating histone methylation. Its role in neural stem cells has not been studied. We show here for the first time that LSD1 serves as a key regulator of neural stem cell proliferation. Inhibition of LSD1 activity or knockdown of LSD1 expression led to dramatically reduced neural stem cell proliferation. LSD1 is recruited by nuclear receptor TLX, an essential neural stem cell regulator, to the promoters of TLX target genes to repress the expression of these genes, which are known regulators of cell proliferation. The importance of LSD1 function in neural stem cells was further supported by the observation that intracranial viral transduction of the LSD1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or intraperitoneal injection of the LSD1 inhibitors pargyline and tranylcypromine led to dramatically reduced neural progenitor proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyri of wild-type adult mouse brains. However, knockout of TLX expression abolished the inhibitory effect of pargyline and tranylcypromine on neural progenitor proliferation, suggesting that TLX is critical for the LSD1 inhibitor effect. These findings revealed a novel role for LSD1 in neural stem cell proliferation and uncovered a mechanism for neural stem cell proliferation through recruitment of LSD1 to modulate TLX activity."

BACKGROUND Sotos syndrome is characterised by learning difficulties, overgrowth, and a typical facial appearance. Microdeletions at 5q35.3, encompassing NSD1, are responsible for approximately 10% of non-Japanese cases of Sotos. In contrast, a recurrent approximately 2 Mb microdeletion has been reported as responsible for approximately 50% of Japanese cases of Sotos. METHODS We screened 471 cases for NSD1 mutations and deletions and identified 23 with 5q35 microdeletions. We investigated the deletion size, parent of origin, and mechanism of generation in these and a further 10 cases identified from published reports. We used \"in silico\" analyses to investigate whether repetitive elements that could generate microdeletions flank NSD1. RESULTS Three repetitive elements flanking NSD1, designated REPcen, REPmid, and REPtel, were identified. Up to 18 cases may have the same sized deletion, but at least eight unique deletion sizes were identified, ranging from 0.4 to 5 Mb. In most instances, the microdeletion arose through interchromosomal rearrangements of the paternally inherited chromosome. CONCLUSIONS Frequency, size, and mechanism of generation of 5q35 microdeletions differ between Japanese and non-Japanese cases of Sotos. Our microdeletions were identified from a large case series with a broad range of phenotypes, suggesting that sample selection variability is unlikely as a sole explanation for these differences and that variation in genomic architecture might be a contributory factor. Non-allelic homologous recombination between REPcen and REPtel may have generated up to 18 microdeletion cases in our series. However, at least 15 cannot be mediated by these repeats, including at least seven deletions of different sizes, implicating multiple mechanisms in the generation of 5q35 microdeletions."

BACKGROUND Most cases of Sotos syndrome are caused by intragenic NSD1 mutations or 5q35 microdeletions. It is uncertain whether allelic or genetic heterogeneity underlies the residual cases and it has been proposed that other mechanisms, such as 11p15 defects, might be responsible for Sotos cases without NSD1 mutations or 5q35 microdeletions. OBJECTIVE To develop a multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay to screen NSD1 for exonic deletions/duplications. METHODS Analysis was undertaken of 18 classic Sotos syndrome cases in which NSD1 mutations and 5q35 microdeletions were excluded. Long range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to characterise the mechanism of generation of the partial NSD1 deletions. RESULTS Eight unique partial NSD1 deletions were identified: exons 1-2 (n = 4), exons 3-5, exons 9-13, exons 19-21, and exon 22. Using long range PCR six of the deletions were confirmed and the precise breakpoints in five cases characterised. This showed that three had arisen through Alu-Alu recombination and two from non-homologous end joining. CONCLUSIONS MLPA is a robust, inexpensive, simple technique that reliably detects both 5q35 microdeletions and partial NSD1 deletions that together account for approximately 15% of Sotos syndrome."

Truncating NSD1 mutations occurred throughout the gene, but pathogenic missense mutations occurred only in functional domains (P < 2 x 10(-16)). Sotos syndrome was clinically diagnosed in 99% of NSD1-positive individuals, independent of the molecular analyses, indicating that NSD1 aberrations are essentially specific to this condition. Furthermore, our data suggest that 93% of patients who have been clinically diagnosed with Sotos syndrome have identifiable NSD1 abnormalities, of which 83% are intragenic mutations and 10% are 5q35 microdeletions. We reviewed the clinical phenotypes of 239 NSD1-positive individuals. Facial dysmorphism, learning disability, and childhood overgrowth were present in 90% of the individuals. However, both the height and head circumference of 10% of the individuals were within the normal range, indicating that overgrowth is not obligatory for the diagnosis of Sotos syndrome. A broad spectrum of associated clinical features was also present, the occurrence of which was largely independent of genotype, since individuals with identical mutations had different phenotypes.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine the NSD1 abnormalities in patients diagnosed with Sotos syndrome and its correlation with the presence, severity, and progression of associated scoliosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Scoliosis has been reported in approximately 30% of patients diagnosed with Sotos syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, learning disability, and overgrowth. Sotos syndrome is mainly attributed to NSD1 haploinsufficiency, but with ethnical differences in genetic profile: NSD1 microdeletions are frequently identified in Japanese Sotos patients whereas intragenic mutations are more frequently found in non-Japanese patients. Although possible genotype-phenotype correlations have been proposed, the genotype of Sotos syndrome patients suffering from scoliosis has not been examined. METHODS The medical records and spinal radiographs of 63 consecutive Sotos syndrome patients at a single center were reviewed. Fluorescent in situ hybridization or microarray comparative genomic hybridization and DNA sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were performed to detect 5q35 microdeletion involving the NSD1 gene and intragenic mutations of the NSD1 gene, respectively. The phenotypes of all cases and radiological assessments for the presence and progression of scoliosis were studied. RESULTS NSD1 abnormalities were identified in 55 patients (87%): microdeletion in 34 patients (54%) and intragenic mutation in 22 patients (33%). Scoliosis was observed in 26 patients (41%), with a significantly higher ratio of microdeletions than mutations. The 10 patients with progressive scoliosis all had NSD1 microdeletions. CONCLUSION Scoliosis was a common phenotypical trait in children with Sotos syndrome and its presence as well as progression were higher in cases with NSD1 microdeletions. Although all Sotos syndrome patients should be monitored for scoliosis, clinicians should be made aware that patients with NSD1 microdeletions have a higher probability of scoliosis development and progression that may require early intervention.Level of Evidence: 3."

Insulin resistance is an important correlate of other risk factors. Excess abdominal fat, as often seen in overweight people and commonly observed in obese individuals, is the single most important central feature of the metabolic syndrome. In addition to insulin resistance, an excess amount of abdominal fat is associated with all the features of metabolic clustering.

The metabolic syndrome is a condition characterized by a special constellation of reversible major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The main, diagnostic, components are reduced HDL-cholesterol, raised triglycerides, blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose, all of which are related to weight gain, specifically intra-abdominal/ectopic fat accumulation and a large waist circumference. Using internationally adopted arbitrary cut-off values for waist circumference, having metabolic syndrome doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease, but offers an effective treatment approach through weight management. Metabolic syndrome now affects 30-40% of people by age 65, driven mainly by adult weight gain, and by a genetic or epigenetic predisposition to intra-abdominal/ectopic fat accumulation related to poor intra-uterine growth. Metabolic syndrome is also promoted by a lack of subcutaneous adipose tissue, low skeletal muscle mass and anti-retroviral drugs. Reducing weight by 5-10%, by diet and exercise, with or without, anti-obesity drugs, substantially lowers all metabolic syndrome components, and risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Other cardiovascular disease risk factors such as smoking should be corrected as a priority. Anti-diabetic agents which improve insulin resistance and reduce blood pressure, lipids and weight should be preferred for diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome. Bariatric surgery offers an alternative treatment for those with BMI \u2265 40 or 35-40 kg/m(2) with other significant co-morbidity. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease is expected to rise along with the global obesity epidemic: greater emphasis should be given to effective early weight-management to reduce risk in pre-symptomatic individuals with large waists."

BACKGROUND Metabolic Syndrome is strongly associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, which significantly increases cardiovascular complications and hence morbidity and mortality. Treating Metabolic Syndrome decreases cardiovascular related disease flares and deaths. This study evaluates prevalence of metabolic syndrome in young Rheumatoid Arthritis patients. METHODS This Cross-sectional study was conducted in rheumatology department of a tertiary care hospital in Karachi. All diagnosed cases of rheumatoid arthritis from April to August 2018 were consecutively included. Disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis assessed by Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Associate determinants of rheumatoid arthritis were measured along with outcome variables. RESULTS Out of 104 rheumatoid arthritis patients, 34 (32.7%) found to have metabolic syndrome in whom 20 (58.8%) of patients were seropositive. A significant association of metabolic syndrome was found with age (p-value 0.023), BMI (p-value 0.006), waist circumference (p-value 0.002), FBS (p-value <0.001), SBP (p-value <0.001), DBP (p-value <0.001), TG (p-value <0.001), HDL (p-value 0.022), and Methotrexate drug history (p-value 0.030).

It also refers to a clustering of specific cardiovascular disease risk factors whose underlying pathophysiology is thought to be related to insulin resistance with an excessive flux of fatty acids implicated. Opinions have varied as to whether the metabolic syndrome should be defined to indicate mainly insulin resistance, the metabolic consequences of obesity, risk of cardiovascular disease, or simply a collection of statistically related factors. Based on these different viewpoints 4 definition sets of the metabolic syndrome are formulated. The pros and cons of each of them are extensively discussed. A major role in the etiology of the metabolic syndrome is ascribed to the occurrence of insulin resistance. Data are provided that insulin resistance can worsen the expression of this syndrome, but cannot have a primary role. Therefore, insulin resistance is not the main player of the metabolic syndrome, but central obesity is. Free fatty acid induced insulin resistance is found and induced by central obesity. The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of abnormalities in which each of them deserves its own (maximal) treatment to diminish the risk for cardiovascular disease."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW The metabolic syndrome is defined by the clustering of a number of cardiovascular risk factors and entails an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality from both cardiovascular disease and all causes. In the present paper, we review the most recent evidence on the association between hyperuricemia, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. RECENT FINDINGS Serum urate is frequently elevated in patients with the metabolic syndrome and increases with the number of components of this condition. Hyperuricemia has been related to decreased renal uric acid excretion, which may be mediated by enhanced proximal tubular sodium reabsorption and hyperinsulinemia. Recent epidemiologic studies have shed some light on the prognosis of hyperuricemia. While hyperuricemia appears to show a benign significance in low cardiovascular risk individuals, it clearly increases cardiovascular mortality in patients at high cardiovascular disease risk. SUMMARY Clinicians should be aware of the presence of metabolic syndrome in patients with hyperuricemia or gout in order to control its components (high blood pressure, obesity, etc.) and hence reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. Long-term, randomized interventional clinical trials are needed to test the hypothesis that urate-lowering therapy can reduce cardiovascular risk in these patients."

BACKGROUND Clinical use of criteria for metabolic syndrome to simultaneously predict risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes remains uncertain. We investigated to what extent metabolic syndrome and its individual components were related to risk for these two diseases in elderly populations. METHODS We related metabolic syndrome (defined on the basis of criteria from the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program) and its five individual components to the risk of events of incident cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in 4812 non-diabetic individuals aged 70-82 years from the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER). We corroborated these data in a second prospective study (the British Regional Heart Study [BRHS]) of 2737 non-diabetic men aged 60-79 years. FINDINGS In PROSPER, 772 cases of incident cardiovascular disease and 287 of diabetes occurred over 3.2 years. Metabolic syndrome was not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in those without baseline disease (hazard ratio 1.07 [95% CI 0.86-1.32]) but was associated with increased risk of diabetes (4.41 [3.33-5.84]) as was each of its components, particularly fasting glucose (18.4 [13.9-24.5]). Results were similar in participants with existing cardiovascular disease. In BRHS, 440 cases of incident cardiovascular disease and 105 of diabetes occurred over 7 years. Metabolic syndrome was modestly associated with incident cardiovascular disease (relative risk 1.27 [1.04-1.56]) despite strong association with diabetes (7.47 [4.90-11.46]). In both studies, body-mass index or waist circumference, triglyceride, and glucose cutoff points were not associated with risk of cardiovascular disease, but all five components were associated with risk of new-onset diabetes. INTERPRETATION Metabolic syndrome and its components are associated with type 2 diabetes but have weak or no association with vascular risk in elderly populations, suggesting that attempts to define criteria that simultaneously predict risk for both cardiovascular disease and diabetes are unhelpful. Clinical focus should remain on establishing optimum risk algorithms for each disease."

MCM interacted with the PA subunit of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is found to be involved in the replication genetically. The virus genome replication was decreased in MCM2 knockdown cells. The viral polymerase appeared to be a nonproductive complex, that is, it was capable of initiating replication but produced only abortive short RNA chains. MCM stimulated de novo-initiated replication reaction by stabilizing a replication complex during its transition from initiation to elongation. Based on the findings, including the result that the MCM-mediated RNA replication reaction was competed with exogenously added RNA, we propose that MCM functions as a scaffold between the nascent RNA chains and the viral polymerase."

UNLABELLED To date, the majority of work on RNA virus replication fidelity has focused on the viral RNA polymerase, while the potential role of other viral replicase proteins in this process is poorly understood. Previous studies used resistance to broad-spectrum RNA mutagens, such as ribavirin, to identify polymerases with increased fidelity that avoid misincorporation of such base analogues. We identified a novel variant in the alphavirus viral helicase/protease, nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) that operates in concert with the viral polymerase nsP4 to further alter replication complex fidelity, a functional linkage that was conserved among the alphavirus genus. Purified chikungunya virus nsP2 presented delayed helicase activity of the high-fidelity enzyme, and yet purified replication complexes manifested stronger RNA polymerization kinetics. Because mutagenic nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin also affect intracellular nucleotide pools, we addressed the link between nucleotide depletion and replication fidelity by using purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. High-fidelity viruses were more resistant to these conditions, and viral growth could be rescued by the addition of exogenous nucleosides, suggesting that mutagenesis by base analogues requires nucleotide pool depletion. This study describes a novel function for nsP2, highlighting the role of other components of the replication complex in regulating viral replication fidelity, and suggests that viruses can alter their replication complex fidelity to overcome intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions. IMPORTANCE Previous studies using the RNA mutagen ribavirin to select for drug-resistant variants have highlighted the essential role of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in regulating replication fidelity. However, the role of other viral replicase components in replication fidelity has not been studied in detail. We identified here an RNA mutagen-resistant variant of the nsP2 helicase/protease that conferred increased fidelity and yet could not operate in the same manner as high-fidelity polymerases. We show that the alphavirus helicase is a key component of the fidelity-regulating machinery. Our data show that the RNA mutagenic activity of compounds such as ribavirin is coupled to and potentiated by nucleotide depletion and that RNA viruses can fine-tune their replication fidelity when faced with an intracellular environment depleted of nucleotides."

The knockdown of DDX5 was able to decrease JEV replication, and overexpression of DDX5 mutants lacking the helicase activity also reduced JEV replication, suggesting the helicase activity is essential for JEV replication.

Meanwhile, we also confirmed that DDX5 interacts with these viral proteins during JEV infection. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that endogenous DDX5 is recruited to the cytoplasm and colocalizes with these viral proteins and viral RNA. RNA-pulldown experiment showed that DDX5 only binds to the JEV 3' untranslated region (UTR). Finally, we confirmed the role of DDX5 in JEV RNA replication using JEV-replicon system.

Positive-stranded (+)RNA viruses greatly exploit host cells to support viral replication. However, unlike many other pathogens, (+)RNA viruses code for only a limited number of genes, making them highly dependent on numerous co-opted host factors for supporting viral replication and other viral processes during their infections. This excessive dependence on subverted host factors, however, renders (+)RNA viruses vulnerable to host restriction factors that could block virus replication. Interestingly, cellular ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicases could promote or inhibit the replication of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) replication. However, it is currently unknown what features make a particular DEAD-box helicase either pro-viral or antiviral. In this work, we succeeded in reversing the viral function of the antiviral DDX17-like RH30 DEAD-box helicase by converting it to a pro-viral helicase. We also turned the pro-viral DDX3-like RH20 helicase into an antiviral helicase through deletion of a unique N-terminal domain. We demonstrate that in the absence of the N-terminal domain, the core helicase domain becomes unhinged, showing altered specificity in unwinding viral RNA duplexes containing cis-acting replication elements.

To determine the role of the NS3 helicase/NTPase in the viral life cycle, deletion and point mutations in the helicase/NTPase motifs of the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) (NADL strain) NS3 protein designed to abolish either helicase activity alone (motif II, DEYH to DEYA) or both NTPase and helicase activity (motif I, GKT to GAT and deletion of motif VI) were generated.

These mutations behaved as predicted with respect to RNA helicase and NTPase activities in vitro. When engineered back into an infectious cDNA for BVDV (NADL strain), point mutations in either the GKT or DEYH motif or deletion of motif VI yielded RNA transcripts that no longer produced infectious virus upon transfection of EBTr cells.

Patients were experimentally studied in an early phase after the event of brain injury (3\u00b11 months after the event) and subsequently in a second session 4\u00b11 months after the first session. The results showed that the concerted modulation of the default mode network (DMN) and attentional network (AN) in response to the active involvement in the task improved with the level of consciousness, reflecting an integral recovery of the brain in its ability to be engaged in cognitive processes. In addition, functional connectivity decreased between the DMN and AN with recovery. Our results help to further understand the neural underpins of the disorders of consciousness."

The intrinsic connectivity of the default mode network has been associated with the level of consciousness in patients with severe brain injury. Especially medial parietal regions are considered to be highly involved in impaired consciousness. To better understand what aspect of this intrinsic architecture is linked to consciousness, we applied spectral dynamic causal modeling to assess effective connectivity within the default mode network in patients with disorders of consciousness. We included 12 controls, 12 patients in minimally conscious state and 13 in vegetative state in this study. For each subject, we first defined the four key regions of the default mode network employing a subject-specific independent component analysis approach. The resulting regions were then included as nodes in a spectral dynamic causal modeling analysis in order to assess how the causal interactions across these regions as well as the characteristics of neuronal fluctuations change with the level of consciousness. The resulting pattern of interaction in controls identified the posterior cingulate cortex as the main driven hub with positive afferent but negative efferent connections. In patients, this pattern appears to be disrupted. Moreover, the vegetative state patients exhibit significantly reduced self-inhibition and increased oscillations in the posterior cingulate cortex compared to minimally conscious state and controls. Finally, the degree of self-inhibition and strength of oscillation in this region is correlated with the level of consciousness. These findings indicate that the equilibrium between excitatory connectivity towards posterior cingulate cortex and its feedback projections is a key aspect of the relationship between alterations in consciousness after severe brain injury and the intrinsic functional architecture of the default mode network. This impairment might be principally due to the disruption of the mechanisms underlying self-inhibition and neuronal oscillations in the posterior cingulate cortex."

BACKGROUND Between pathologically impaired consciousness and normal consciousness exists a scarcely researched transition zone, referred to as emergence from minimally conscious state, in which patients regain the capacity for functional communication, object use, or both. We investigated neural correlates of consciousness in these patients compared with patients with disorders of consciousness and healthy controls, by multimodal imaging. METHODS In this cross-sectional, multimodal imaging study, patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, patients in a minimally conscious state, and patients who had emerged from a minimally conscious state, diagnosed with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, were recruited from the neurology department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. Key exclusion criteria were neuroimaging examination in an acute state, sedation or anaesthesia during scanning, large focal brain damage, motion parameters of more than 3 mm in translation and 3\u00b0 in rotation, and suboptimal segmentation and normalisation. We acquired resting state functional and structural MRI data and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET data; we used seed-based functional MRI (fMRI) analysis to investigate positive default mode network connectivity (within-network correlations) and negative default mode network connectivity (between-network anticorrelations). We correlated FDG-PET brain metabolism with fMRI connectivity. We used voxel-based morphometry to test the effect of anatomical deformations on functional connectivity. FINDINGS We recruited a convenience sample of 58 patients (21 [36%] with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, 24 [41%] in a minimally conscious state, and 13 [22%] who had emerged from a minimally conscious state) and 35 healthy controls between Oct 1, 2009, and Oct 31, 2014. We detected consciousness-level-dependent increases (from unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, minimally conscious state, emergence from minimally conscious state, to healthy controls) for positive and negative default mode network connectivity, brain metabolism, and grey matter volume (p<0\u00b705 false discovery rate corrected for multiple comparisons). Positive default mode network connectivity differed between patients and controls but not among patient groups (F test p<0\u00b70001). Negative default mode network connectivity was only detected in healthy controls and in those who had emerged from a minimally conscious state; patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or in a minimally conscious state showed pathological between-network positive connectivity (hyperconnectivity; F test p<0\u00b70001). Brain metabolism correlated with positive default mode network connectivity (Spearman's r=0\u00b750 [95% CI 0\u00b726 to 0\u00b761]; p<0\u00b70001) and negative default mode network connectivity (Spearman's r=-0\u00b752 [-0\u00b735 to -0\u00b767); p<0\u00b70001). Grey matter volume did not differ between the studied groups (F test p=0\u00b706). INTERPRETATION Partial preservation of between-network anticorrelations, which are seemingly of neuronal origin and cannot be solely explained by morphological deformations, characterise patients who have emerged from a minimally conscious state. Conversely, patients with disorders of consciousness show pathological between-network correlations. Apart from a deeper understanding of the neural correlates of consciousness, these findings have clinical implications and might be particularly relevant for outcome prediction and could inspire new therapeutic options.

BACKGROUND Interactions between the thalamus and the cortex play an important role in consciousness. The thalamus as a homogenous structure is less strongly connected with the default mode network (DMN) in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC), but the roles of specific thalamic nuclei are not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional connectivity between individual thalamic nuclei and the DMN in DOC patients. METHODS Nine DOC patients and nine age-matched healthy controls were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at resting state. Data-driven independent component analysis and hypothesis-driven region of interest-based correlation analysis were performed. RESULTS In comparison with healthy controls, DOC patients had significantly decreased functional connectivity between the mediodorsal thalamus and brain areas within the DMN, including the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. Patients and controls did not show significant differences in functional connectivity in other thalamic nuclei. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that functional connections between the mediodorsal thalamus and the DMN may play important roles in the pathogenesis of DOC."

Disorders of consciousness are impaired states of consciousness caused by severe brain injuries. Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported abnormal brain network properties at different topological scales in patients with disorders of consciousness by using graph theoretical analysis. However, it is still unclear how inter-regional directed propagation activities affect the topological organization of functional brain networks in patients with disorders of consciousness. To reveal the altered topological organization in patients with disorders of consciousness, we constructed whole-brain directed functional networks by combining functional connectivity analysis and time delay estimation. Then we performed graph theoretical analysis based on the directed functional brain networks at three topological scales, from the nodal scale, the resting-state network scale to the global scale. Finally, the canonical correlation analysis was used to determine the correlations between altered topological properties and clinical scores in patients with disorders of consciousness. At the nodal scale, we observed decreased in-degree and increased out-degree in the precuneus in patients with disorders of consciousness. At the resting-state network scale, the patients with disorders of consciousness showed reorganized motif patterns within the default mode network and between the default mode network and other resting-state networks. At the global scale, we found a lower global clustering coefficient in the patients with disorders of consciousness than in the controls. The results of the canonical correlation analysis showed that the abnormal degree and the disrupted motif were significantly correlated with the clinical scores of the patients with disorders of consciousness. Our findings showed that consciousness impairment can be revealed by abnormal directed connection patterns at multiple topological scales in the whole brain, and the disrupted directed connection patterns may serve as clinical biomarkers to assess the dysfunction of patients with disorders of consciousness."

Severe brain injury may cause disruption of neural networks that sustain arousal and awareness, the two essential components of consciousness. Despite the potentially devastating immediate and long-term consequences, disorders of consciousness (DoC) are poorly understood in terms of their underlying neurobiology, the relationship between pathophysiology and recovery, and the predictors of treatment efficacy. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques have enabled the study of network connectivity, providing great potential to improve the clinical care of patients with DoC. Initial discoveries in this field were made using positron emission tomography (PET). More recently, functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) techniques have added to our understanding of functional network dynamics in this population. Both methods have shown that whether at rest or performing a goal-oriented task, functional networks essential for processing intrinsic thoughts and extrinsic stimuli are disrupted in patients with DoC compared with healthy subjects. Atypical connectivity has been well established in the default mode network as well as in other cortical and subcortical networks that may be required for consciousness. Moreover, the degree of altered connectivity may be related to the severity of impaired consciousness, and recovery of consciousness has been shown to be associated with restoration of connectivity. In this review, we discuss PET and fMRI studies of functional and effective connectivity in patients with DoC and suggest how this field can move toward clinical application of functional network mapping in the future."

Functional connectivity has been correlated with a patient's level of consciousness and has been found to be altered in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Absence epilepsy patients, who experience a loss of consciousness, are assumed to suffer from alterations in thalamocortical networks; however, previous studies have not explored the changes at a functional module level. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the alteration in functional connectivity that occurs in absence epilepsy patients. By parcellating the brain into 90 brain regions/nodes, we uncovered an altered functional connectivity within and between functional modules. Some brain regions had a greater number of altered connections and therefore behaved as key nodes in the changed network pattern; these regions included the superior frontal gyrus, the amygdala, and the putamen. In particular, the superior frontal gyrus demonstrated both an increased value of connections with other nodes of the frontal default mode network and a decreased value of connections with the limbic system. This divergence is positively correlated with epilepsy duration. These findings provide a new perspective and shed light on how functional connectivity and the balance of within/between module connections may contribute to both the state of consciousness and the development of absence epilepsy."

The aim of the study is to characterize such connectivity patterns and relate the observed changes to clinical and neuropsychological outcomes of these patients after a period of intensive neurorehabilitation. Our findings show within the default mode network a disruption of connectivity of medial pre-frontal regions and a significant change of amplitude of internal connections. Notably, strongest changes in functional connectivity significantly correlated to consistent clinical and cognitive recovery.

Rs-fMRI was performed using a 3.0T MR-scanner on patients (N = 46, women) with neurological disorders (chronic pain, dizziness, headaches, and/or tinnitus) in the late postoperative period (>12 months) after Patey radical mastectomy for breast cancer. According to the intergroup statistical analysis, there were differences in the functional connectivity of the default mode network in all 46 patients after breast cancer treatment compared to the control group (p < 0.01). The use of rs-fMRI in in breast cancer survivors allowed us to identify changes in the functional connectivity in the brain caused by neurological disorders, which correlated with a decreased quality of life in these patients.

Macrophages are critical sentinel cells armed with multiple regulated necrosis pathways, including pyroptosis, apoptosis followed by secondary necrosis, and necroptosis, and are poised to undergo distinct form(s) of necrosis for tackling dangers of pathogenic infection or toxic exposure. The natural BH3-mimetic gossypol is a toxic phytochemical that can induce apoptosis and/or pyroptotic-like cell death, but what exact forms of regulated necrosis are induced remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrated that gossypol induces pyroptotic-like cell death in both unprimed and lipopolysaccharide-primed mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), as evidenced by membrane swelling and ballooning accompanied by propidium iodide incorporation and lactic acid dehydrogenase release. Notably, gossypol simultaneously induces the activation of both pyroptotic and apoptotic (followed by secondary necrosis) pathways but only weakly activates the necroptosis pathway. Unexpectedly, gossypol-induced necrosis is independent of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, as neither inhibitor for the NLRP3 pathway nor NLRP3 deficiency protects the macrophages from the necrosis. Furthermore, necrotic inhibitors or even pan-caspase inhibitor alone does not or only partly inhibit such necrosis. Instead, a combination of inhibitors composed of pan-caspase inhibitor IDN-6556, RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872 and NADPH oxidase inhibitor GKT137831 not only markedly inhibits the necrosis, with all apoptotic and pyroptotic pathways being blocked, but also attenuates gossypol-induced peritonitis in mice. Lastly, the activation of the NLRP3 pathway and apoptotic caspase-3 appears to be independent of each other. Collectively, gossypol simultaneously induces the activation of multiple subroutines of regulated necrosis in macrophages depending on both apoptotic and inflammatory caspases."

Here, our clinical data showed that SP and its receptor Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) were significantly elevated in the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collected from patients with bronchial asthma, and further pre-clinical experiments evidenced that SP suppressed cell viability, accelerated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and upregulated ASC, Caspase-1, NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 to promote pyroptotic cell death and cellular inflammation in the human bronchial epithelial cells and asthmatic mice models in vitro and in vivo.

Pyroptosis is a caspase-1/3/4/5/8/11-mediated form of programmed cell death. It is primarily induced through two pathways - the canonical and noncanonical pathways. Following enzymatic cleavage, gasdermin D, a key substrate for pyroptosis, releases N-terminal fragments that form pores on the plasma membrane, triggering osmotic lysis, and eventually releases cytosolic material to trigger inflammatory responses. Various pyroptotic pathway mediators are involved in lung cancer initiation, proliferation, migration, and invasion, and an increasing number of anticancer compounds have been developed by regulating the pyroptotic pathway.

Sevoflurane, a common clinical anesthetic, has been reported as therapeutic drug for ALI. However, the detailed mechanisms by which sevoflurane ameliorates ALI have not been fully delineated.

Specifically, in the LPS-induced ALI mice models, sevoflurane attenuated lung damages and fibrosis, and restrained the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Acrylamide (ACR), a soft electrophile, is a typical environmental and food contaminant that presents potential health hazards and, consequently, is attracting increasing attention in the quest for its control. ACR neurotoxicity has been widely reported in experimental animals and attributed to neuroinflammation; however, the mechanisms involved therein require clarification. In this study, we used a neuron cell model to investigate the mechanisms of ACR-induced neuroinflammation and pyroptosis. The results showed that ACR treatment induced lytic cell death morphologically under both the canonical pyroptotic pathway (NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC)-cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 1 (caspase-1)-gasdermin D (GSDMD)-interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2)/interleukin-18 (IL-18)) and an alternative pyroptotic pathway (cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (caspase-3)-gasdermin E (GSDME)-IL-1\u03b2/IL-18) in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) production, cytokines release, and lytic cell death induced by ACR were diminished by caspase-1 and -3 inhibitors. Furthermore, the knockdown of caspase-1 by small interfering RNA attenuated ACR-induced lytic cell death, suggesting that canonical pyroptosis (the NLRP3-caspase 1-GSDMD-IL-1\u03b2 signaling axis) played a primary role in the ACR-induced pyroptosis. Of the two pyroptotic-related pathways, the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade was activated first within the 6-h period of ACR exposure, while the activation of the alternative pyroptotic pathway was delayed. Collectively, these results indicate that ACR mainly induces NLRP3-related neuroinflammation and pyroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, which is, thus, suggestive of an alternative mechanism for ACR-induced neurotoxicity."

Our previous study found that BaP induced pyroptotic and autophagic death in HL-7702 human liver cells; the relevant mechanisms, however, remain unknown. This work was therefore to unravel the effects of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway on pyroptotic and autophagic death triggered by BaP. Cells were treated with or without LY294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor) and IGF-1 (PI3K/Akt activator) before BaP exposure, and the results showed that compared with the control, the protein expression of p-Akt was markedly decreased by BaP (p < 0.05). IGF-1 did not subvert this inhibitive effect of BaP, while LY294002 enhanced it. Furthermore, the protein expression of pyroptosis (Cleaved Caspase-1, NO, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18), as well as LDH and the relative electrical conductivity were significantly augmented by BaP. The levels of these indices were increased by LY294002 pretreatment, and decreased by IGF-1. Similarly, LY294002 enhanced BaP-induced increase in the key protein expression of autophagy (Beclin-1 and LC3II), while IGF-1 weakened it. Finally, the phosphorylation of FOXO4 was clearly (p < 0.01) inhibited by BaP, and LY294002 suppressed this inhibitive effect of BaP, while IGF-1 strengthened it.

BACKGROUND Glycosides are the pharmacodynamic substances of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD) and they exert a protective effect in the brain by inhibiting neuronal pyroptosis of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR). However, the mechanism by which glycosides regulate neuronal pyroptosis of CIR is still unclear. PURPOSE A significant part of this study aimed to demonstrate whether glycosides have an anti-pyroptotic effect on CIR by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidative mechanism. METHODS Rats were used in vivo models of middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R). Neuroprotective effect of glycosides after Nrf2 inhibiting was observed by nerve function score, Nissl staining, Nrf2 fluorescence staining and pyroptotic proteins detection. SH-SY5Y cells were used in vitro models of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Glycosides was evaluated for their effects by measuring cell morphology, survival rate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) rate and expression of pyroptotic proteins. Nrf2 si-RNA 54-1 interference with lentivirus was used to create silenced Nrf2 SH-SY5Y cells (si-Nrf2-SH-SY5Y). Glycosides were evaluated on si-Con-SH-SY5Y and si-Nrf2-SH-SY5Y cells based on the expression of Nrf2 signaling pathway, pyroptotic proteins and cell damage manifestation. RESULTS In vivo, glycosides significantly promoted the fluorescence level of nuclear Nrf2, added more Nissl bodies, reduced neurological function scores and inhibited the pyroptotic proteins level. In vitro, glycosides significantly repaired the morphological damage of cells, promoted the survival rate, reduced the LDH rate, inhibited the pyroptosis. Moreover, antioxidant activity of glycosides was enhanced via Nrf2 activation. Both Nrf2 blocking in vivo and Nrf2 silencing in vitro significantly weakened the pyroptosis inhibitory and neuroprotective effects of glycosides. CONCLUSION These results suggested for the first time that glycosides inhibited neuronal pyroptosis by regulating the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant stress pathway, thereby exerting brain protection of CIR. As a result of this study, This study improved understanding of the pharmacodynamics and mechanism of BYHWD, as well as providing a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment strategy for CIR ."

OBJECTIVE Prior epidemiological studies suggest a possible association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumors. A meta-analysis was performed statistically pooling all available observational studies on this topic in order to evaluate this suspected association. METHODS Using previously described methods, a protocol was developed for a meta-analysis examining the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and subsequent development of primary brain tumors in their offspring. Literature search techniques, study inclusion criteria and statistical procedures were prospectively defined. Data from epidemiological studies were pooled using a general variance-based meta-analytic method employing confidence intervals previously described by Greenland. The outcome of interest was a summary relative risk (RRs) reflecting the risk of childhood brain tumor development associated with mother's smoking during the index pregnancy. Sensitivity analyses were performed when necessary to explain any observed statistical heterogeneity and/or to evaluate the impact of demographic or study characteristics on the summary estimate of effect. RESULTS Twelve observational studies meeting protocol specified inclusion criteria were obtained via a comprehensive literature search. These studies enrolled a total of 6566 patients. Analysis for homogeneity demonstrated that the data were homogeneous (P > 0.50) and could be statistically combined. Pooling all twelve reports yielded an RRs of 1.05 (0.90-1.21), a non-statistically significant result suggesting no clear association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumor development. Numerous sensitivity analyses examining the possible effect of study design and various patient characteristics failed to show any influence on the RRs further supporting the observed lack of association. CONCLUSION The available epidemiological data do not support a clear association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and pediatric brain tumor development. Although it appears likely that no association exists, limitations in study designs limit definitive conclusions based on available data."

However, its impact on the brain, whether it be from prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease, is still not very clear. Neuroimaging and neuropathological investigations suggest that there are heterogeneous effects of cigarette smoking on the brain. On the one hand, it is quite clear that cigarette smoking causes damage to endothelial cells, resulting in increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. On the other hand, it seems to be associated with different Alzheimer's pathologies in post-mortem brains and experimental models, despite the fact that epidemiological studies clearly indicate a positive correlation between cigarette smoking and increased risk for AD. Interestingly, cigarette smoking appears to be associated with reduced Parkinson's pathology in post-mortem brains. However, although nicotine in cigarettes may have some neuroprotective actions, the effects of all the other toxic compounds in cigarettes cannot be ignored. It is, therefore, our aim to summarize what is known about the neuropathology of cigarette smoking and, in particular, its implications for neurodegenerative diseases."

Maternal first- or second-hand tobacco smoking during pregnancy is still common albeit that the detrimental effects to the unborn child are well known. Maternal tobacco cigarette smoking can affect multiple organ systems in the offspring, rendering them at increased risk of various conditions throughout life (eg. intrauterine underdevelopment, asthma, substance abuse, diabetes). However, this review will only focus on its impact on the brain and the related molecular changes in the offspring based on evidence from animal studies. Although epidemiological studies have identified the associations between maternal cigarette smoke exposure (SE) and brain disorders, animal models can help identify the underlying mechanisms and test interventions. Human studies have found that maternal SE is closely linked to small brain size and changes in brain structure and associated with a high risk of cognitive defects. Animal models suggest that this may be due to increased brain oxidative stress and inflammation during the neonatal period, leading to increased brain cell apoptosis in adulthood. There is a distinct gender bias of such impacts, where male offspring are more affected than females. Female offspring seem to have developed the adaptation by increasing endogenous antioxidant levels. Indeed, animal studies have shown that using antioxidant supplementation during pregnancy can improve neurological outcomes in male offspring, however, the efficacy in humans is yet to be confirmed. Furthermore, some animal studies suggested nicotine as the key player in intrauterine underdevelopment due to maternal SE, while human clinical trials using nicotine replacement therapy do not support this mechanism. This review will discuss the possible reasons."

While the prevalence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has decreased worldwide, this decline has plateaued recently. Strategies are needed to resume the constant decrease of SIDS in Japan. A prospective electrocardiographic screening program for infants was performed between July 2010 and March 2011. Parents of 4319 infants were asked about environmental factors related to SIDS through questionnaires at a one-month medical checkup and one year. Parental awareness of prone position, smoke exposure, and breast feeding as environmental factors were 81.4 %, 69.0 %, and 47.8 %, respectively. The prevalence of laying infants exclusively in a supine position was 96.7 %. At the one-month medical checkup, smoking prevalence was 41.7 % in fathers and 2.1 % in mothers. Maternal smoking prevalence was significantly increased at one year after (p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that risk factors for new or continued maternal smoking habits were maternal smoking habits at one month (p < 0.001), paternal smoking habits one year later (p < 0.001), and younger maternal age (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION Most parents already avoid laying infants in the prone position, and parental smoking is still a SIDS risk concern in Japan.

BACKGROUND Tobacco metabolites and carcinogens can be found in placental and umbilical cord tissues of fetuses exposed to maternal smoking. However, studies regarding maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood brain tumor (CBT) have shown inconsistent results. METHODS All children born in Sweden between 1983 and 2010 and with information about maternal smoking during pregnancy, obtained from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, were included in this population based cohort study (n=2,577,305). CBT cases were identified from the National Cancer Register. Cox regression models were used to estimate the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on the risk of CBTs. RESULTS We identified 1039 cases of CBT in the cohort. Overall, there was little or no effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on the risk of CBTs. However, in analyses stratified by age at diagnosis and child's sex, positive associations were found among 5-9 years old children. In this age interval, maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of all CBTs combined only among male children (RR=1.50, 95% CI 0.96-2.34), while for astrocytoma there was a positive association in both male (RR=2.00, 95% CI 1.02-3.91) and female children (RR=1.80, 95% CI 0.85-3.82).

UNLABELLED What is already known about this subject There is an association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and higher body mass index (BMI) and overweight in childhood. What this study adds The association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood overweight develops with age, starting with a lower birth weight, followed by weight catch-up in the first year after birth, finally leading to overweight at school age. Children of mothers who had smoked during pregnancy had a higher risk of exceeding the 85th percentile of BMI, waist circumference and total skinfold thickness at school age. BACKGROUND Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with childhood overweight, but the association with fat distribution is not clear. OBJECTIVE To explore the longitudinal association between smoking during pregnancy and childhood overweight and fat distribution. METHODS In the KOALA Birth Cohort Study, repeated questionnaires were administered to 2698 mother-child pairs, including questions on smoking at 14 and 34 weeks of pregnancy. Main outcomes were birth weight, weight gain in the first year, body mass index (BMI) z-scores and overweight (BMI \u226585th percentile) at 1, 2, 4-5 and 6-7 years (n = 1730) and waist circumference and four skinfold thicknesses measured at home visits at age 6-7 years in a subgroup (n = 418). We used multivariable linear and logistic regression, with generalized estimating equations (GEE) for repeated measurements. RESULTS Maternal smoking was associated with lower birth weight, higher weight gain in the first year and increasing overweight after infancy (change with age P = 0.02 in the GEE). Maternal smoking vs. non-smoking during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of the child exceeding the 85th percentile of BMI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.72; 95% CI 1.33-10.4), waist circumference (aOR 2.65; 95% CI 1.06-6.59) and sum of skinfold thicknesses (aOR 4.45; 95% CI 1.63-12.2) at the age of 6-7 years.

Enrichment of modified peptides from global peptides is inevitable in mass spectrometric analysis protein modifications because of their importance in the study of cellular functions and low abundance in the global proteomic analysis. Recent advances in enrichment methods for modified peptides such as phosphopeptides and intact glycopeptides (IGPs) show that the methods for proteomic analyses of both protein modifications are robust. We have recently observed and reported a large number of IGPs from phosphoproteomic analysis using IMAC-based phosphopeptides enrichment procedure. To determine whether phosphorylated peptides could be specifically isolated from coenriched IGPs in IMAC experiments with different pH, IMAC procedures were performed at different pH conditions, and we found that the enrichment of phosphopeptides at pH 2.0 was the optimal condition for having the highest number of phosphopeptide identifications; however, coenrichment of phosphopeptides and glycopeptides was inevitable in the entire pH range. The hydrophilic enrichments of IGPs performed before or after IMAC enrichment were evaluated subsequently to determine the optimal workflow for simultaneous analyses of phosphopeptides and glycopeptides, and IMAC enrichment followed by hydrophilic enrichment was chosen as the optimized workflow. Applying the workflow to the TMT-labeled peptides from luminal and basal-like type of breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models allowed quantitative analyses of phospho- and glycoproteomics with 17582 phosphopeptides and 3468 glycopeptides identified, and 1237 phosphopeptides and 236 glycopeptides showed significant expression differences between luminal and basal-like, respectively.

Many pathological conditions are caused by dysregulation of cell signaling, which can generate a cascade of abnormal responses and completely change the functions of a cell or tissue. A large portion of the regulation of these signals is via protein phosphorylation, in which cell responses can be activated or inhibited. Proteins that are both downstream and upstream of a phosphorylated protein can be modified, altering metabolism and other biological processes. Recently, the number of phosphoproteomic studies based on mass spectrometry has increased, constantly aiming to obtain a higher coverage of proteins and increase the number and location of their phospho-sites, as well as better understand their respective phosphorylation states. In this way, it is possible to better understand biological processes as a whole and their roles in cellular dysfunctions and diseases. To study changes at the phosphoproteome level, the stochiometric imbalance between the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides must be overcome, since higher quantities and comparatively better ionization of non-phosphorylated peptides can suppress the ion signals of the phosphorylated peptides. It is for this reason that phosphophopeptides are rarely found in samples that did not pass through a phospho-enrichment step, highlighting the importance of performing enrichment steps in phosphoproteomic studies. The numbers of identified phosphopeptides and phosphorylation sites are extremely important to the quality of a phosphoproteomic analysis; therefore, the efficiency of the enrichment process is critical. Here, phospho-enrichment techniques are presented to offer insight into the applicability of these methods to different experiment types and consequently support the growth of phosphoproteomic studies overall."

Because protein phosphorylation is a dynamic process, and it is present at low abundance within cells, and the phosphorylated sites on proteins might vary, and mass spectrometry (MS) signals from phosphopeptides are usually suppressed etc., so phosphoprotein analysis have more difficulties than nonphosphoprotein.

Variegated plants are valuable materials for investigating leaf color regulated mechanisms. To unveil the role of posttranslational modification in the variegated phenotype, we conducted global quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis on different leaf color sectors of Maiyuanjinqiu and the corresponding of Catalpa fargesii using Ti4+-IMAC phosphopeptide enrichment. A total of 3778 phosphorylated sites assigned to 1646 phosphoproteins were identified, and 3221 in 1434 proteins were quantified. Differential phosphoproteins (above 1.5 or below 1/1.5) in various leaf color sectors were selected for functional enrichment analyses. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment revealed that processes of photosynthesis, regulation of the generation of precursor metabolites, response to stress, homeostasis, amino acid metabolism, transport-related processes, and most of the energy metabolisms might contribute to leaf color. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed based on differential phosphoproteins (DPs) in different organelles. The result showed that most enriched pathways were located in the chloroplasts and cytosol. The phosphorylation levels of glycometabolism enzymes might greatly affect leaf variegation. Measurements of fluorescence parameters and enzyme activities confirmed that protein phosphorylation could affect plant physiology by regulating enzyme activity. These results provide new clues for further study the formation mechanisms of naturally variegated phenotype."

Tyrosine phosphorylation is an important regulator of signaling in cellular pathways, and dysregulated tyrosine phosphorylation causes several diseases. Mass spectrometry has revealed the importance of global phosphoproteomic characterization. Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation by studying the mass-spectrometry (MS)-determined phosphoproteome remains difficult because of the relatively low abundance of tyrosine phosphoproteins. To effectively evaluate tyrosine-phosphopeptide enrichment and reduce ion suppression from non-phosphorylated peptides in MS analysis, three trypsin-digested BSA peptides and 14 standard phosphopeptides, including six tyrosine phosphopeptides, four serine phosphopeptides, and four threonine phosphopeptides, were subjected to titanium dioxide immunoaffinity-based enrichment and also to combined enrichment using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses. The enrichment factors were evaluated to determine the efficiency of each enrichment procedure. Comparison of five optimized enrichment methods, including TiO2-based immunoaffinity purification in Tris and MOPS buffer systems, TiO2-immunoaffinity enrichment, and immunoaffinity-TiO2 enrichment for total tyrosine, serine and threonine phosphopeptides, revealed that the order of the enrichment factors for total tyrosine phosphopeptides is: (i) immunoaffinity-TiO2 (enrichment factor = 38,244), (ii) TiO2-immunoaffinity (enrichment factor = 24,987), (iii) TiO2 micro-column (enrichment factor = 10,305), (iv) immunoaffinity in Tris buffer system (enrichment factor = 1450), and (v) immunoaffinity in the MOPS buffer system (enrichment factor = 32). These results reveal that an alternative enrichment scheme before use of a TiO2 micro-column, using immunoaffinity 4G10 and PY99 antibody enrichment under optimized conditions, can provide greater selectivity for tyrosine-phosphopeptide enrichment."

Early detection and targeted therapy represent a novel regimen of cancer management. The understanding of receptor tyrosine kinases in tumorigenesis at the molecular level has led to the first generation of kinase inhibitors for anticancer therapy that targets a specific kinase or pathway. While the therapeutic advantage is obvious, targeted therapy often relapses and results in drug resistance for advanced cancers. To achieve feasible early detection and better efficacy of therapeutics targeting multiple pathways, significantly more biomarkers and drug targets are in demand, especially for individualized therapy. Recent advances in phosphoprotein enrichment and MS technologies for quantitative phosphoproteome analysis provide great opportunities in the identification and validation of kinases as drug targets.

INTRODUCTION Naxos disease is a rare entity that manifests with woolly hair, keratosis of extremities, and cardiac manifestations that resemble arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and mutations affecting plakoglobin and desmoplakin have been identified. There is an increased risk of arrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death at a young age. Right ventricular systolic dysfunction often progresses and left ventricular involvement may also occur. AREAS COVERED This article reviews historic background, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, genetics, and pathogenesis as well as therapeutic management and future perspectives. EXPERT OPINION The principles of evaluation and treatment are based on arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and general heart failure guidelines, because specific data on Naxos disease are limited. Therefore, larger registries on Naxos disease are welcome in order to gain more knowledge about clinical course and risk stratification.

BACKGROUND Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart muscle disease of unknown etiology that causes arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden death. Diagnosis can be difficult, and this hampers investigation of its molecular basis. Forms of ARVC in which gene penetrance and disease expression are greater should facilitate genetic study. We undertook a clinical and genetic investigation of Naxos disease, originally described by Protonotarios in 1986. This disease constitutes the triad of ARVC, diffuse nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair. METHODS AND RESULTS We evaluated the population of Naxos, Greece, to identify probands, which was followed by family screening. Twenty-one affected persons from 9 families of 150 persons were identified. Linkage analysis was performed with microsatellite markers. The disease locus mapped to 17q21. A peak 2-point LOD score of 3.62 at theta=0.0 was found with a marker within intron 4 of the keratin 9 gene, a member of the type I (acidic) keratin family. A preserved homozygous disease haplotype was identified. Haplotype analysis delimited the disease interval. CONCLUSIONS Hair and skin abnormalities were found to be reliable markers of subsequent heart disease. This suggests the presence of a single mutant gene with novel cardiac, skin, and hair function or two or more tightly linked disease genes. Recessive inheritance of Naxos disease and a founder effect were demonstrated. Identification of a fully informative genetic marker linked to the disease and uncommon in the background population may be of use as a test to identify disease gene carriers."

OBJECTIVES We tested the hypothesis that defective interactions between adhesion junctions and the cytoskeleton caused by the plakoglobin mutation in Naxos disease lead to remodeling of gap junctions and altered expression of the major gap junction protein, connexin43. BACKGROUND Naxos disease, a recessive form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, is associated with a high incidence of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Naxos disease is caused by a mutation in plakoglobin, a protein that links cell-cell adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton. METHODS Myocardial expression of connexin43 and other intercellular junction proteins was characterized in 4 patients with Naxos disease. Immunohistochemistry was performed in all 4 patients, and immunoblotting and electron microscopy were performed in 1 patient who died in childhood before overt arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy had developed. RESULTS Connexin43 expression at intercellular junctions was reduced significantly in both right and left ventricles in all patients with Naxos disease. Electron microscopy revealed smaller and fewer gap junctions interconnecting ventricular myocytes. Mutant plakoglobin was expressed but failed to localize normally at intercellular junctions. Localization of N-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenins, plakophilin-2, desmoplakin-1, and desmocollin-2 at intercalated disks appeared normal. CONCLUSIONS Remodeling of gap junctions occurs early in Naxos disease, presumably because of abnormal linkage between mechanical junctions and the cytoskeleton. Gap junction remodeling may produce a coupling defect which, combined with the subsequent development of pathologic changes in myocardium, could contribute to a highly arrhythmogenic substrate and enhance the risk of sudden death in Naxos disease."

BACKGROUND Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an autosomal dominant heart muscle disorder that causes arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. Previously we mapped the genetic locus for the triad of autosomal recessive ARVC, palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair (Naxos disease) to chromosome 17q21, in which the gene for plakoglobin is encoded. This protein is a key component of desmosomes and adherens junctions, and is important for the tight adhesion of many cell types, including those in the heart and skin. METHODS We studied 19 individuals with Naxos disease, as well as unaffected family members and unrelated individuals from the neighbouring Greek islands of Naxos and Milos. Gene sequence was determined by reverse transcriptase PCR from RNA isolated from the skin of an affected individual and mutations in other cases were confirmed by restriction-enzyme analysis. FINDINGS A homozygous 2 base pair deletion in the plakoglobin gene was identified only in the 19 affected individuals. This deletion caused a frameshift and premature termination of the protein, which was shown by western blot analysis. 29 clinically unaffected family members were heterozygous for the mutation; 20 unrelated individuals from Naxos and 43 autosomal dominant ARVC probands were homozygous for the normal allele. INTERPRETATION The finding of a deletion in plakoglobin in ARVC suggests that the proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion play an important part in maintaining myocyte integrity, and when junctions are disrupted, cell death, and fibrofatty replacement occur. Therefore, the discovery of a mutation in a protein with functions in maintaining cell junction integrity has important implications for other dominant forms of ARVC, related cardiomyopathies, and other cutaneous diseases."

Selenoproteins contain selenium in the form of selenocysteine and perform a variety of cellular functions, including antioxidant defense. To determine whether the levels of selenoproteins can influence carcinogenesis independent of selenium intake, a unique mouse model was developed by breeding two transgenic animals: mice with reduced selenoprotein levels because of the expression of an altered selenocysteine-tRNA (i6A-) and mice that develop prostate cancer because of the targeted expression of the SV40 large T and small t oncogenes to that organ [C3(1)/Tag].

Two selenium-containing proteins, selenium binding protein 1 and selenoprotein F, affect prostate cancer phenotypes by modulating tumor cell metabolic profiles with significant effects on mitochondrial biology, including oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis.

BACKGROUND Data from human epidemiological studies, cultured mammalian cells, and animal models have supported a potentially beneficial role of selenium (Se) in prostate cancer prevention. In addition, Se-containing proteins including members of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) family and Selenium-Binding Protein 1 (SBP1) have been linked to either cancer risk or development. For example, SBP1 levels are typically reduced in tumors compared to non-cancerous tissue, with the degree of reduction associated with increasingly poor clinical outcome. METHODS In order to investigate inter-relationships between blood and tissue Se levels and GPx activity, tissue SBP1 levels, and disease aggressiveness using the Gleason score, we measured levels of selenium and selected selenoproteins in fasting serum and histologically normal prostate tissues obtained from 24 men undergoing radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. RESULTS GPx enzyme activity was inversely correlated with SBP1 levels in prostate tissue as determined by densitometry of Western blots obtained using anti-SBP1 antibodies [partial Spearman's correlation coefficients and corresponding P-values overall and in African-Americans = -0.42 (0.08) and -0.53 (0.10), respectively], which is consistent with previous observations in cultured cells and mice. Of particular interest was the positive correlation between tissue GPx activity and Gleason score, with this relationship achieving statistical significance among African-Americans (r = 0.67, P = 0.02).

Se is an unusual trace element in having its own codon in mRNA that specifies its insertion into selenoproteins as selenocysteine (SeCys), by means of a mechanism requiring a large SeCys-insertion complex. This exacting insertion machinery for selenoprotein production has implications for the Se requirements for cancer prevention. If Se may protect against cancer, an adequate intake of Se is desirable. However, the level of intake in Europe and some parts of the world is not adequate for full expression of protective selenoproteins. The evidence for Se as a cancer preventive agent includes that from geographic, animal, prospective and intervention studies. Newly-published prospective studies on oesophageal, gastric-cardia and lung cancer have reinforced previous evidence, which is particularly strong for prostate cancer. Interventions with Se have shown benefit in reducing the risk of cancer incidence and mortality in all cancers combined, and specifically in liver, prostate, colo-rectal and lung cancers. The effect seems to be strongest in those individuals with the lowest Se status. As the level of Se that appears to be required for optimal effect is higher than that previously understood to be required to maximise the activity of selenoenzymes, the question has been raised as to whether selenoproteins are involved in the anti-cancer process. However, recent evidence showing an association between Se, reduction of DNA damage and oxidative stress together with data showing an effect of selenoprotein genotype on cancer risk implies that selenoproteins are indeed implicated. The likelihood of simultaneous and consecutive effects at different cancer stages still allows an important role for anti-cancer Se metabolites such as methyl selenol formed from gamma-glutamyl-selenomethyl-SeCys and selenomethyl-SeCys, components identified in certain plants and Se-enriched yeast that have anti-cancer effects. There is some evidence that Se may affect not only cancer risk but also progression and metastasis. Current primary and secondary prevention trials of Se are underway in the USA, including the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) relating to prostate cancer, although a large European trial is still desirable given the likelihood of a stronger effect in populations of lower Se status."

Selenium is an essential mineral element with important biological functions for the whole body through incorporation into selenoproteins. This element is highly concentrated in the thyroid gland. Selenoproteins provide antioxidant protection for this tissue against the oxidative stress caused by free radicals and contribute, via iodothyronine deiodinases, to the metabolism of thyroid hormones. It is known that oxidative stress plays a major role in carcinogenesis and that in recent decades there has been an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer. The anti-carcinogenic action of selenium, although not fully understood, is mainly attributable to selenoproteins antioxidant properties, and to the ability to modulate cell proliferation (cell cycle and apoptosis), energy metabolism, and cellular immune response, significantly altered during tumorigenesis. Researchers have suggested that different forms of selenium supplementation may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of thyroid cancer; however, the studies have several methodological limitations. This review is a summary of the current knowledge on how selenium and selenoproteins related to thyroid cancer."

Atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent the greatest threats to human health worldwide. Selenium, an essential trace element, is incorporated into selenoproteins that play a crucial role in human health and disease. Although findings from a limited number of randomized trials have been inconsistent and cannot support a protective role of Se supplementation in CVDs, prospective observational studies have generally shown a significant inverse association between selenium or selenoprotein status and CVD risk. Furthermore, a benefit of selenium supplementation in the prevention of CVDs has been seen in population with low baseline selenium status. Evidence from animal studies shows consistent results that selenium and selenoproteins might prevent experimental atherosclerosis, which can be explained by the molecular and cellular effects of selenium observed both in animal models and cell cultures. Selenoproteins of particular relevance to atherosclerosis are glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxin reductase 1, selenoprotein P, selenoprotein S. The present review is focusing on the existing evidence that supports the concept that optimal selenium intake can prevent atherosclerosis. Its underlying mechanisms include inhibiting oxidative stress, modulating inflammation, suppressing endothelial dysfunction, and protecting vascular cells against apoptosis and calcification. However, the benefit of selenium supplementation in the prevention of atherosclerosis remains insufficiently documented so far. Future studies with regard to the effects of selenium supplementation on atherosclerosis should consider many factors, especially the baseline selenium status, the dose and forms of selenium supplementation, and the selenoprotein genotype. Additionally, much more studies are needed to confirm the roles of selenoproteins in atherosclerosis prevention and clarify the underlying mechanisms."

The requirement of the trace element selenium for life and its beneficial role in human health has been known for several decades. This is attributed to low molecular weight selenium compounds, as well as to its presence within at least 25 proteins, named selenoproteins, in the form of the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Incorporation of Sec into selenoproteins employs a unique mechanism that involves decoding of the UGA codon. This process requires multiple features such as the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element and several protein factors including a specific elongation factor EFSec and the SECIS binding protein 2, SBP2. The function of most selenoproteins is currently unknown; however, thioredoxin reductases (TrxR), glutathione peroxidases (GPx) and thyroid hormone deiodinases (DIO) are well characterised selenoproteins involved in redox regulation of intracellular signalling, redox homeostasis and thyroid hormone metabolism. Recent evidence points to a role for selenium compounds as well as selenoproteins in the prevention of some forms of cancer. A number of clinical trials are either underway or being planned to examine the effects of selenium on cancer incidence. In this review we describe some of the recent progress in our understanding of the mechanism of selenoprotein synthesis, the role of selenoproteins in human health and disease and the therapeutic potential of some of these proteins."

BACKGROUND Mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RyR2) underlie catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), an inherited arrhythmogenic disease occurring in the structurally intact heart. The proportion of patients with CPVT carrying RyR2 mutations is unknown, and the clinical features of RyR2-CPVT as compared with nongenotyped CPVT are undefined. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with documented polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias occurring during physical or emotional stress with a normal heart entered the study. The clinical phenotype of the 30 probands and of 118 family members was evaluated, and mutation screening on the RyR2 gene was performed. Arrhythmias documented in probands were: 14 of 30 bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, 12 of 30 polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and 4 of 30 catecholaminergic idiopathic ventricular fibrillation; RyR2 mutations were identified in 14 of 30 probands (36% bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, 58% polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, 50% catecholaminergic idiopathic ventricular fibrillation) and in 9 family members (4 silent gene carriers). Genotype-phenotype analysis showed that patients with RyR2 CPVT have events at a younger age than do patients with nongenotyped CPVT and that male sex is a risk factor for syncope in RyR2-CPVT (relative risk=4.2). CONCLUSIONS CPVT is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease manifesting beyond pediatric age with a spectrum of polymorphic arrhythmias. beta-Blockers reduce arrhythmias, but in 30% of patients an implantable defibrillator may be required. Genetic analysis identifies two groups of patients: Patients with nongenotyped CPVT are predominantly women and become symptomatic later in life; patients with RyR2 CPVT become symptomatic earlier, and men are at higher risk of cardiac events. These data provide a rationale for prompt evaluation and treatment of young men with RyR2 mutations."

Although rare, CPVT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of young individuals with exercise-induced syncope. Mutations in five different genes (RYR2, CASQ2, CALM1, TRDN, and TECRL) are associated with the CPVT phenotype, although RYR2 missense mutations are implicated in up to 60 % of all CPVT cases.

SeP are also involved in apoptosis, cell growth and modification of the action of cell signalling systems and transcription factors. Some intestinal GPx modulate apoptosis by removing the cells affected by oxidative damage preserving tissue integrity. The malfunctioning of the GPx antioxidant system in intestinal mucosa can trigger a continuous cycle of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Selenium deficiency is a risk factor, due to the malabsorption, in celiac disease (CD) because the inflammatory damage affects the small intestine; this deficiency can modulate SeP genes expression, with consequent reiteration of inflammation and increase of mucosal damage. In active CD, overexpression of interleukin-15 (IL-15) may increase activation of effector mechanisms of epithelial damage by stimulating T helper 1 cytokine proliferation and production and intraepithelial lymphocytes cytotoxicity by protecting these lymphocytes from apoptosis. Blocking IL-15 has the potential to provide new therapeutic tools to prevent both tissue damage and complication of CD such as autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) where IL-15 expression is also increases.

INTRODUCTION In areas with severe selenium deficiency higher incidence of thyroiditis has been reported due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE To study the effect of selenium supplementation in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a blinded placebo-controlled prospective study done in 60 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (as defined by an anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) level more than 150 IU/ml) irrespective of the baseline thyroid status. Patients with overt hyperthyroidism who are on antithyroid drugs, patients on any other medication, which may alter the immunity status of the patients, and pregnant patients were excluded from the study. Patients were randomized into two age and TPOAb-matched groups; 30 patients received 200 \u03bcg of sodium selenite/day, orally, for 3 months, and 30 patients received placebo. All hypothyroid patients were given l-thyroxine replacement. RESULTS Of 30 patients in the selenium treated group, 6 patients were overtly hypothyroid, 15 were subclinical hypothyroid, 6 were euthyroid, and 3 were subclinical hyperthyroid. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly by 49.5% (P < 0.013) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% (P < 0.95) in the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSION Selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review provides an appraisal of recent evidence for or against selenium supplementation in patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases, and discusses possible effect mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS Epidemiological data suggest an increased prevalence of autoimmune thyroid diseases under conditions of low dietary selenium intake. Two systematic reviews have evaluated controlled trials among patients with autoimmune thyroiditis and report that selenium supplementation decreases circulating thyroid autoantibodies. The immunomodulatory effects of selenium might involve reducing proinflammatory cytokine release. However, clinically relevant effects of selenium supplementation, including improvement in quality of life, are more elusive. In Graves' disease, some, but not all, trials indicate that adjuvant selenium supplementation enhances the restoration of biochemical euthyroidism, and might benefit patients with mild Graves' orbitopathy. SUMMARY The use of selenium supplementation as adjuvant therapy to standard thyroid medication may be widespread, but a growing body of evidence yields equivocal results. The available evidence from trials does not support routine selenium supplementation in the standard treatment of patients with autoimmune thyroiditis or Graves' disease. However, correction of moderate to severe selenium deficiency may offer benefits in preventing, as well as treating, these disorders. Molecular mechanisms have been proposed, but further studies are needed."

It is capable of exerting an influence on immunological responses, cell growth and viral defence. Nevertheless, it is mostly required for the proper thyroid function. There were described 25 selenoproteins, which play various roles in human body. Selenium is an essential particle in the active site of enzymes such as GPXs (glutathione peroxidases), Ds (deiodinases) and TRs (thioredoxin reductases). Owing to this, it has a fundamental importance in the synthesis and function of thyroid hormones, and protects cells against free radicals and oxidative damage. Intake of selenium necessary to maintain suitable selenoenzyme activity ranges from 60 \u03bcg to 75 \u03bcg per day. Selenium deficiency contributes to decreased activity of GPXs, which can lead to oxidative damage, or Ds, which is connected with impaired thyroid activity. Moreover, a low selenium concentration causes autoimmune processes in the thyroid gland, thus selenium deficiency is essential in pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroiditis or Graves' disease. Because of regulation of the cell cycle, a decreased concentration of selenium impacts on the development of thyroid cancer."

CONTEXT The recent recognition that the essential trace element selenium is incorporated as selenocysteine in all three deiodinases has decisively confirmed the clear-cut link between selenium and thyroid function. It has additionally been established that the thyroid contains more selenium than any other tissue and that selenium deficiency aggravates the manifestation of endemic myxedematous cretinism and autoimmune thyroid disease. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Clinical reports as well as a large number of biochemical articles linking selenium to thyroid have been considered. Interventional, prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However, considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise impact of the basal antithyroid peroxidase level, and the effect of disease duration on the treatment outcome. Clearly, further in-depth studies and evaluation are required concerning the mechanism of action of selenium as well as the choice of supplements or dietary intake.

The trace element selenium is an essential micronutrient that is required for the biosynthesis of selenocysteine-containing selenoproteins. Most of the known selenoproteins are expressed in the thyroid gland, including some with still unknown functions. Among the well-characterized selenoproteins are the iodothyronine deiodinases, glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases, enzymes involved in thyroid hormone metabolism, regulation of redox state and protection from oxidative damage. Selenium content in selenium-sensitive tissues such as the liver, kidney or muscle and expression of nonessential selenoproteins, such as the glutathione peroxidases GPx1 and GPx3, is controlled by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed. As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction."

The type 2 and type 3 deiodinases make vital contributions to this process by controlling levels of the thyroid hormones T(4) and T(3) available to different tissues. Because the tadpole thyroid gland is not functional until stage NF44, it has been widely assumed that thyroid signaling is absent during amphibian early development, thyroid hormone only becoming a major regulator during premetamorphic stages. Similarly, in mammals, thyroid function is known to be essential to neuronal development, especially during the perinatal stages, but again little is known about early stages of development. Here we demonstrate that key elements of thyroid hormone signaling are present during early development of Xenopus. In particular, we find functional thyroid hormone-activating deiodinases and significant levels of their substrates, T(4) and T(3), during early embryogenesis. Furthermore, we have further characterized a recently identified deiodinase in amphibians, homologous to mammalian type 1 deiodinase (D1). This enzyme is expressed in marked, spatially defined patterns during embryogenesis. The patterns of expression of type 1 deiodinase are distinct from those of type 2 and type 3 deiodinases. Deiodinase expression is found in neurogenic areas from stage NF30 onward, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems. We conclude that both activating and inactivating deiodinases show dynamic patterns of expression during early embryogenesis in amphibians, particularly in neurogenic areas. These findings suggest that thyroid hormone signaling is a key component of early neuronal development in vertebrates."

Most brain T(3) is indeed locally formed by deiodination of thyroxine (T(4)). This reaction is catalyzed by D2 expressed in astrocytes throughout the brain and in tanycytes in the mediobasal hypothalamus. D3, which inactivates both T(4) and T(3), is mainly expressed in neurons also throughout the brain, with high expression in hippocampus and pyriform cortex. The regulation of deiodinases by many factors in addition to the thyroid hormones indicate that their role is not limited to mitigate the fluctuations in plasma T(4) and T(3).

Nerve lesions induce D2 in peripheral nerve sheaths and D3 in the endoneurial compartment containing Schwann cells.

High-Km rT3 outer ring deiodination (ORD) was observed in tilapia kidney, low-Km T4 ORD in liver, and low-Km T3 inner ring deiodination (IRD) in brain and gill. The rT3 ORD activity in tilapia kidney has a very similar substrate specificity as rat liver type I iodothyronine deiodinase but is much less sensitive to inhibition by propylthiouracil, iodoacetic acid, and aurothioglucose. Tilapia liver T4 ORD activity and tilapia brain and gill T3 IRD activities show very similar substrate specificities as well as similar inhibitor sensitivities as rat type II and type III iodothyronine deiodinase, respectively. The optimal pH of the tilapian enzymes is 6-7, and the optimal incubation temperature is approximately 37 C.

Thyroid hormones (THs) are key regulators in the development of the vertebrate brain. Therefore, TH access to the developing brain needs to be strictly regulated. The brain barriers separate the central nervous system from the rest of the body and impose specific transport mechanisms on the exchange of molecules between the general circulation and the nervous system. As such they form ideal structures for regulating TH exchange between the blood and the brain. To investigate the mechanism by which the developing brain regulates TH availability, we investigated the ontogenetic expression profiles of TH transporters, deiodinases and the TH distributor protein transthyretin (TTR) at the brain barriers during embryonic and early postnatal development using the chicken as a model. In situ hybridisation revealed expression of the TH transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and 10 (MCT10), organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1) and L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) and the inactivating type 3 deiodinase (D3) in the choroid plexus which forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. This was confirmed by quantitative PCR which additionally indicated strongly increasing expression of TTR as well as detectable expression of the activating type 2 deiodinase (D2) and the (in)activating type 1 deiodinase (D1). In the brain capillaries forming the blood-brain barrier in situ hybridisation showed exclusive expression of LAT1 and D2. The combined presence of LAT1 and D2 in brain capillaries suggests that the blood-brain barrier forms the main route for receptor-active T3 uptake into the embryonic chicken brain. Expression of multiple transporters, deiodinases and TTR in the choroid plexus indicates that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier is also important in regulating early TH availability. The impact of these barrier systems can be deduced from the clear difference in T3 and T4 levels as well as the T3/T4 ratio between the developing brain and the general circulation. We conclude that the tight regulation of TH exchange at the brain barriers from early embryonic stages is one of the factors needed to allow the brain to develop within a relative microenvironment."

Many xenobiotic compounds with endocrine disrupting activity have been described since the late eighties. These compounds are able to interact with natural hormone systems and potentially induce deleterious effects in wildlife, notably piscine species. However, while the characterization of endocrine disruptors with \"dioxin-like\", estrogenic or androgenic activities is relatively well established, little is known about environmentally relevant pollutants that may act at thyroid system level. Iodothyronine deiodinases, the key enzymes in the activation and inactivation of thyroid hormones, have been suggested as suitable biomarkers for thyroid metabolism disruption. The present article reviews the biotic and abiotic factors that are able to modulate deiodinases in teleosts, a representative model organism for vertebrates. Data show that deiodinases are highly sensitive to several physiological and physical variables, so they should be taken into account to establish natural basal deiodination patterns to further understand responses under chemical exposure. Among xenobiotic compounds, brominated flame retardants are postulated as chemicals of major concern because of their similar structure shared with thyroid hormones. More ambiguous results are shown for the rest of compounds, i.e. polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluorinated chemicals, pesticides, metals and synthetic drugs, in part due to the limited information available. The different mechanisms of action still remain unknown for most of those compounds, although several hypothesis based on observed effects are discussed. Future tasks are also suggested with the aim of moving forward in the full characterization of chemical compounds with thyroid disrupting activity."

However, in human infants neuromotor development correlates best with maternal TH levels in the first trimester of pregnancy, suggesting that TH signaling could affect early brain development. Studying TH signaling in early embryogenesis in mammals is experimentally challenging. In contrast, free-living embryos, such as Xenopus laevis, permit physiological experimentation independent of maternal factors. We detailed key elements of TH signaling: ligands, receptors (TR), and deiodinases during early X. laevis development, before embryonic thyroid gland formation. Dynamic profiles for all components were found. Between developmental stages 37 and 41 (~48 h after hatching, coincident with a phase of continuing neurogenesis) significant increases in T(3) levels as well as in mRNA encoding deiodinases and TR occurred. Exposure of embryos at this developmental stage for 24 h to either a TH antagonist, NH-3, or to tetrabromobisphenol A, a flame retardant and known TH disruptor, differentially modulated the expression of a number of TH target genes implicated in neural stem cell function or neural differentiation. Moreover, 24-h exposure to either NH-3 or tetrabromobisphenol A diminished cell proliferation in the brain. Thus, these data show first, that TH signaling exerts regulatory roles in early X. laevis neurogenesis and second, that this period represents a potential window for endocrine disruption."

By plotting these repair rates in relation to genes and their associated flanking sequences, we reveal that, in normal cells, genomic repair rates display a distinctive pattern, suggesting that DNA repair is highly organized within the genome. Furthermore, by comparing genome-wide DNA repair rates in wild-type cells and cells defective in the global genome-NER (GG-NER) subpathway, we establish how this alters the distribution of NER rates throughout the genome. We also examined the genomic locations of GG-NER factor binding to chromatin before and after UV irradiation, revealing that GG-NER is organized and initiated from specific genomic locations. At these sites, chromatin occupancy of the histone acetyl-transferase Gcn5 is controlled by the GG-NER complex, which regulates histone H3 acetylation and chromatin structure, thereby promoting efficient DNA repair of UV-induced lesions. Chromatin remodeling during the GG-NER process is therefore organized into these genomic domains.

To date, however, the precise roles of UPS in GG-NER remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that the proteasome subunit PSMD14 and the UPS shuttle factor RAD23B can be recruited to sites with UV-induced photolesions even in the absence of XPC, suggesting that proteolysis occurs at DNA damage sites. Unexpectedly, sustained inhibition of proteasome activity results in aggregation of PSMD14 (presumably with other proteasome components) at the periphery of nucleoli, by which DDB2 is immobilized and sequestered from its lesion recognition functions. Although depletion of PSMD14 alleviates such DDB2 immobilization induced by proteasome inhibitors, recruitment of DDB2 to DNA damage sites is then severely compromised in the absence of PSMD14. Because all of these proteasome dysfunctions selectively impair removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, but not (6-4) photoproducts, our results indicate that the functional integrity of the proteasome is essential for the DDB2-mediated lesion recognition sub-pathway, but not for GG-NER initiated through direct lesion recognition by XPC."

BACKGROUND Monopterus albus is a hermaphroditic and economically farmed fish that undergoes sex reversal from ovary to testis via ovotestis during gonadal development. The epigenetic changes that are associated with gonadal development in this species remain unclear. METHODS We produced DNA methylome, transcriptome, and chromatin accessibility maps of the key stages of gonad development: ovary, ovotestis, and testis. The expression of the key candidate genes was detected using qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization and the methylation levels were analysed using bisulphite sequencing PCR. Promoter activity and regulation were assessed using dual-luciferase reporter assays. RESULTS Gonadal development exhibits highly dynamic transcriptomic, DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility changes. We found that DNA methylation status, especially of the transcription start site, was significantly negatively correlated with gene expression while chromatin accessibility exhibited no correlation with gene expression during gonadal development. The epigenetic signatures revealed many novel regulatory elements and genes involved in sex reversal, which were validated. DNA methylation detection and site mutation of plastin-2 promoter, as a candidate gene, revealed that DNA methylation could impact the binding of transcription factor dmrt1 and foxl2 through methylation and demethylation to regulate plastin-2 expression during gonadal development. CONCLUSIONS These data provide novel insights into epigenetic modification and help elucidate the potential molecular mechanism by which dynamic modification of DNA methylation plays a crucial role in gonadal development."

Epigenetics deals with changes in gene expression that are not determined by changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic changes refer to changes in the structure of DNA, which are the result of DNA modification after replication and/or post-translational modification of proteins associated with DNA. In contrast to mutations, epigenetic changes are reversible and occur very rapidly.

BACKGROUND Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common chronic metabolic diseases characterized by insulin resistance and the decrease of insulin secretion. Genetic variation can only explain part of the heritability of T2D, so there need new methods to detect the susceptibility genes of the disease. Epigenetics could establish the interface between the environmental factor and the T2D Pathological mechanism. RESULTS Based on the network theory and by combining epigenetic characteristics with human interactome, the weighted human DNA methylation network (WMPN) was constructed, and a T2D-related subnetwork (TMSN) was obtained through T2D-related differentially methylated genes. It is found that TMSN had a T2D specific network structure that non-fatal metabolic disease causing genes were often located in the topological and functional periphery of network. Combined with chromatin modifications, the weighted chromatin modification network (WCPN) was built, and a T2D-related chromatin modification pattern subnetwork was obtained by the TMSN gene set. TCSN had a densely connected network community, indicating that TMSN and TCSN could represent a collection of T2D-related epigenetic dysregulated sub-pathways. Using the cumulative hypergeometric test, 24 interplay modules of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications were identified. By the analysis of gene expression in human T2D islet tissue, it is found that there existed genes with the variant expression level caused by the aberrant DNA methylation and (or) chromatin modifications, which might affect and promote the development of T2D.

Over the last few years, epigenetic research has undergone a gradual shift and recent studies have been directed toward a genome-wide assessment. DNA methylation and chromatin modifications are essential components of the regulation of gene activity. DNA methylation effectively down-regulates gene activity by addition of a methyl group to the five-carbon of a cytosine base. Less specifically, modification of the chromatin structure can be carried out by multiple mechanisms leading to either the upregulation or down-regulation of the associated gene. Of the many assays used to assess the effects of epigenetic modifications, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which serves to monitor changes in chromatin structure, and bisulfite modification, which tracks changes in DNA methylation, are the two most commonly used techniques."

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is widely used to detect genome-wide interactions between a protein of interest and DNA in vivo. Loci showing strong enrichment over adjacent background regions are typically considered to be sites of binding. Insufficient attention has been given to systematic artifacts inherent to the ChIP-seq procedure that might generate a misleading picture of protein binding to certain loci. We show here that unrelated transcription factors appear to consistently bind to the gene bodies of highly transcribed genes in yeast. Strikingly, several types of negative control experiments, including a protein that is not expected to bind chromatin, also showed similar patterns of strong binding within gene bodies. These false positive signals were evident across sequencing platforms and immunoprecipitation protocols, as well as in previously published datasets from other labs. We show that these false positive signals derive from high rates of transcription, and are inherent to the ChIP procedure, although they are exacerbated by sequencing library construction procedures. This expression bias is strong enough that a known transcriptional repressor like Tup1 can erroneously appear to be an activator. Another type of background bias stems from the inherent nucleosomal structure of chromatin, and can potentially make it seem like certain factors bind nucleosomes even when they don't. Our analysis suggests that a mock ChIP sample offers a better normalization control for the expression bias, whereas the ChIP input is more appropriate for the nucleosomal periodicity bias. While these controls alleviate the effect of the biases to some extent, they are unable to eliminate it completely.

We analyzed ChIP-Seq peaks of the Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 silencing proteins and discovered 238 unexpected euchromatic loci that exhibited enrichment of all three. Surprisingly, published ChIP-Seq datasets for the Ste12 transcription factor and the centromeric Cse4 protein indicated that these proteins were also enriched in the same euchromatic regions with the high Sir protein levels. The 238 loci, termed \"hyper-ChIPable\", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase II and polymerase III enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and ChIP enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide. The apparent enrichment of various proteins at hyper-ChIPable loci was not a consequence of artifacts associated with deep sequencing methods, as confirmed by ChIP-quantitative PCR. The localization of unrelated proteins, including the entire silencing complex, to the most highly transcribed genes was highly suggestive of a technical issue with the immunoprecipitations. ChIP-Seq on chromatin immunoprecipitated with a nuclear-localized GFP reproduced the above enrichment in an expression-dependent manner: induction of the GAL genes resulted in an increased ChIP signal of the GFP protein at these loci, with presumably no biological relevance.

Using input samples from ChIP-Seq studies, we detected a similar bias throughout the heterochromatic portions of the yeast genome. We also observed significant chromatin-related effects at telomeres, protein binding sites, and genes, reflected in the variation of input-Seq coverage. Experimental tests of candidate regions showed that chromatin influenced shearing at some loci, and that chromatin could also lead to enriched or depleted DNA levels in prepared samples, independently of shearing effects. Our results suggested that assays relying on immunoprecipitation of chromatin will be biased by intrinsic differences between regions packaged into different chromatin structures - biases which have been largely ignored to date.

BACKGROUND Somatic hypermutation introduces base substitutions into the rearranged and expressed immunoglobulin (Ig) variable regions to promote immunity. This pathway requires and is initiated by the Activation Induced Deaminase (AID) protein, which deaminates cytidine to produce uracils and UG mismatches at the Ig genes. Subsequent processing of uracil by mismatch repair and base excision repair factors contributes to mutagenesis. While selective for certain genomic targets, the chromatin modifications which distinguish hypermutating from non-hypermutating loci are not defined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here, we show that AID-targeted loci in mammalian B cells contain ubiquitinated chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of a constitutively hypermutating Burkitt's B cell line, Ramos, revealed the presence of monoubiquitinated forms of both histone H2A and H2B at two AID-associated loci, but not at control loci which are expressed but not hypermutated. Similar analysis using LPS activated primary murine splenocytes showed enrichment of the expressed V(H) and Sgamma3 switch regions upon ChIP with antibody specific to AID and to monoubiquitinated H2A and H2B. In the mechanism of mammalian hypermutation, AID may interact with ubiquitinated chromatin because confocal immunofluorescence microscopy visualized AID colocalized with monoubiquitinated H2B within discrete nuclear foci. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Our results indicate that monoubiquitinated histones accompany active somatic hypermutation, revealing part of the histone code marking AID-targeted loci. This expands the current view of the chromatin state during hypermutation by identifying a specific nucleosome architecture associated with somatic hypermutation."

RG7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of MDM2 antagonists currently in phase I clinical studies.

RG7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell lines.

IC50 of 0.52 \u03bcmol/L vs. 21.9 \u03bcmol/L). MDM4-amplified PDCLs were highly sensitive but showed intermediate response (avg. IC50 of 1.2 \u03bcmol/L), whereas response was heterogeneous in TP53 wild-type PDCLs with normal MDM2/4 levels (avg. IC50 of 7.7 \u03bcmol/L). In MDM2-amplified lines, RG7112 restored p53 activity inducing robust p21 expression and apoptosis. PK profiling of RG7112-treated PDCL intracranial xenografts demonstrated that the compound significantly crosses the blood-brain and the blood-tumor barriers. Most importantly, treatment of MDM2-amplified/TP53 wild-type PDCL-derived model (subcutaneous and orthotopic) reduced tumor growth, was cytotoxic, and significantly increased survival. CONCLUSIONS These data strongly support development of MDM2 inhibitors for clinical testing in MDM2-amplified GBM patients. Moreover, significant efficacy in a subset of non-MDM2-amplified models suggests that additional markers of response to MDM2 inhibitors must be identified."

Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most aggressive and common solid tumors in pediatrics. Development of effective new therapeutics for NB is in progress to help reduce mortality and morbidity of the disease, particularly in relapsed patients. The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a critical role in multiple signaling pathways to maintain cellular hemostasis. Dysregulation of p53 protein and/or molecular aberrations have been associated with multiple human malignancies. p53 stability and protein activity is negatively regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase (MDM2). Thus, targeting p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction is a feasible and promising therapeutic strategy to restore the physiological function of p53 in cancer cells. RG7112 is a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, which target a unique structure located within p53 binding motif of MDM2. The efficacy of RG7112 in vitro using NB cell lines was examined. Two wild-type (WT)-p53 NB cell lines IMR5 and LAN-5, a mutant p53 cell line SK-N-BE(2), and a WT-p53/p14 deleted cell line SH-EP were employed. Data showed that RG7112 significantly reduced cellular viability of IMR5 (IC50, 562 nM) and LAN-5 (IC50, 430 nM), but not SK-N-BE(2) and SH-EP cells. Further, RG7112 restores p53 and p21 protein levels in IMR5 and LAN-5 in a dose-dependent manner. RG7112 induces cell cycle arresting (60% G1 arresting) in WT-p53 cells (IMR5), but no pronounced effect observed in SK-N-BE(2). In this study, 15 different drugs in combination with RG7112 in IMR5 cell line and identified venetoclax (Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor) as a promising candidate were evaluated. Taken together, these findings provide initial proof-of-concept data for further investigations of RG7112 in selected subgroups of NB patients."

MDM2 expression in ovarian cancer tissues was analyzed by microarray and real-time PCR, and its relationship with prognosis was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The anti-tumor activities of MDM2 siRNA and the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 were assessed by cell viability assay, western blotting, and flow cytometry.

MDM2 expression was significantly higher in clear cell carcinoma than in ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (P = 0.0092) and normal tissues (P = 0.035). High MDM2 expression determined by microarray was significantly associated with poor progression-free survival and poor overall survival (P = 0.0002, and P = 0.0008, respectively).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Primary study objectives included determination of the dose and safety profile of RG7112. Secondary objectives included evaluation of pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics, such as TP53-mutation status and MDM2 expression; and preliminary clinical activity. Patients were divided into two cohorts: Stratum A [relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML; except acute promyelocytic leukemia), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia] and Stratum B (relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphocytic leukemia; CLL/sCLL). Some Stratum A patients were treated at the MTD to assess clinical activity. RESULTS RG7112 was administered to 116 patients (96 patients in Stratum A and 20 patients in Stratum B). All patients experienced at least 1 adverse event, and 3 dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that twice-daily dosing enhanced daily exposure. Antileukemia activity was observed in the 30 patients with AML assessed at the MTD, including 5 patients who met International Working Group (IWG) criteria for response. Exploratory analysis revealed TP53 mutations in 14% of Stratum A patients and in 40% of Stratum B patients. Two patients with TP53 mutations exhibited clinical activity. p53 target genes were induced only in TP53 wild-type leukemic cells. Baseline expression levels of MDM2 correlated positively with clinical response. CONCLUSIONS RG7112 demonstrated clinical activity against relapsed/refractory AML and CLL/sCLL.

The development of MDM4 inhibitors as an approach to reactivating p53 in human cancer is attracting increasing attention; however, whether they affect the function of MDM2 and how they interact with MDM2 inhibitors remain unknown. We addressed this question in the present study using CEP-1347, an inhibitor of MDM4 protein expression. The effects of CEP-1347, the genetic and/or pharmacological inhibition of MDM2, and their combination on the p53 pathway in malignant brain tumor cell lines expressing wild-type p53 were investigated by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. The growth inhibitory effects of CEP-1347 alone or in combination with MDM2 on inhibition were examined by dye exclusion and/or colony formation assays. The treatment of malignant brain tumor cell lines with CEP-1347 markedly increased MDM2 protein expression, while blocking CEP-1347-induced MDM2 overexpression by genetic knockdown augmented the effects of CEP-1347 on the p53 pathway and cell growth. Blocking the MDM2-p53 interaction using the small molecule MDM2 inhibitor RG7112, but not MDM2 knockdown, reduced MDM4 expression. Consequently, RG7112 effectively cooperated with CEP-1347 to reduce MDM4 expression, activate the p53 pathway, and inhibit cell growth.

Cytosol-side-out vacuolar membrane vesicles loaded with 45Ca2+ showed voltage- and Ca(2+)-dependent Ca2+ release, which was sensitive to the SV channel modulators DIDS, protein phosphatase 2B and calmodulin.

Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is a syndrome of blunted cardiac systolic and diastolic function in patients with cirrhosis. However, the mechanisms remain incompletely known. Since contractility and relaxation depend on cardiomyocyte calcium transients, any factors that impact cardiac contractile and relaxation functions act eventually through calcium transients. In addition, calcium transients play an important role in cardiac arrhythmias. The present review summarizes the calcium handling system and its role in cardiac function in cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and its mechanisms. The calcium handling system includes calcium channels on the sarcolemmal plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes, the intracellular calcium-regulatory apparatus, and pertinent proteins in the cytosol. L-type calcium channels, the main calcium channel in the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes, are decreased in the cirrhotic heart, and the calcium current is decreased during the action potential both at baseline and under stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, which reduces the signal to calcium-induced calcium release. The study of sarcomere length fluctuations and calcium transients demonstrated that calcium leakage exists in cirrhotic cardiomyocytes, which decreases the amount of calcium storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The decreased storage of calcium in the SR underlies the reduced calcium released from the SR, which results in decreased cardiac contractility. Based on studies of heart failure with non-cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, it is believed that the calcium leakage is due to the destabilization of interdomain interactions (dispersion) of ryanodine receptors (RyRs). A similar dispersion of RyRs may also play an important role in reduced contractility. Multiple defects in calcium handling thus contribute to the pathogenesis of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy."

The properties of depolarization-evoked calcium transients are known to change during the maturation of dissociated cerebellar granule neuron cultures.

Both depletion of intracellular calcium stores and the pharmacological blockade of CICR significantly reduced depolarization stimulated calcium transients in young but not older (>/=1 week) cultures. This functional decrease in the CICR signaling component was associated with the reduction of ryanodine receptor (RyR) immunoreactivity during granule neuron maturation both in culture and in the intact cerebellum. These observations are consistent with the idea that changes in RyR expression result in functional changes in calcium signaling transients during normal neuronal development in the intact mammalian cerebellum as well as in reduced neuronal cultures. Pharmacological disruption of CICR during neuron differentiation in vitro resulted in dose-dependent changes in survival, GAP-43 expression, and the acquisition of the glutamatergic neurotransmitter phenotype. Together, these results indicate that CICR function plays a physiologically relevant role in regulating early granule neuron differentiation in vitro and is likely to play a role in cerebellar maturation."

In the mature auditory system, inner hair cells (IHCs) convert sound-induced vibrations into electrical signals that are relayed to the central nervous system via auditory afferents. Before the cochlea can respond to normal sound levels, developing IHCs fire calcium-based action potentials that disappear close to the onset of hearing. Action potential firing triggers transmitter release from the immature IHC that in turn generates experience-independent firing in auditory neurons. These early signaling events are thought to be essential for the organization and development of the auditory system and hair cells. A critical component of the action potential is the rise in intracellular calcium that activates both small conductance potassium channels essential during membrane repolarization, and triggers transmitter release from the cell. Whether this calcium signal is generated by calcium influx or requires calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) is not yet known. IHCs can generate CICR, but to date its physiological role has remained unclear. Here, we used high and low concentrations of ryanodine to block or enhance CICR to determine whether calcium release from intracellular stores affected action potential waveform, interspike interval, or changes in membrane capacitance during development of mouse IHCs. Blocking CICR resulted in mixed action potential waveforms with both brief and prolonged oscillations in membrane potential and intracellular calcium. This mixed behavior is captured well by our mathematical model of IHC electrical activity. We perform two-parameter bifurcation analysis of the model that predicts the dependence of IHCs firing patterns on the level of activation of two parameters, the SK2 channels activation and CICR rate. Our data show that CICR forms an important component of the calcium signal that shapes action potentials and regulates firing patterns, but is not involved directly in triggering exocytosis. These data provide important insights into the calcium signaling mechanisms involved in early developmental processes."

Depletion of internal calcium stores with thapsigargin and prevention of CICR with ryanodine have no effect on paired-pulse facilitation, delayed release of neurotransmitter, or calcium-dependent recovery from depression. Fluorometric calcium measurements also show that these drugs have no effect on the residual calcium signal that underlies these forms of short-term presynaptic plasticity. Finally, although caffeine causes CICR in Purkinje cell bodies and dendrites, it does not elicit CICR in parallel fiber inputs to these cells. Taken together, these results indicate that for the excitatory synapses studied here, internal calcium stores and CICR do not contribute to short-term presynaptic plasticity on the milliseconds-to-seconds time scale. Instead, this plasticity is driven by the residual calcium signal arising from calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels."

PURPOSE It is uncertain why retinal capillaries are particularly vulnerable to hypoxia. In this study, it was hypothesized that their specialized physiology, which includes being the predominant microvascular location of functional adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels, boosts their susceptibility to hypoxia-induced cell death. METHODS Cell viability, ionic currents, intracellular calcium, and pericyte contractility in microvascular complexes freshly isolated from the rat retina were assessed using trypan blue dye exclusion, perforated-patch recordings, fura-2 fluorescence, and time-lapse videos. Chemical hypoxia was induced by antimycin, an oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor. RESULTS In freshly isolated retinal microvascular complexes, chemical hypoxia caused more cell death in capillaries than in arterioles. Indicative of the role of polyamine-dependent K(ATP) channels, antimycin-induced capillary cell death was markedly decreased in microvessels treated with the polyamine synthesis inhibitor, difluoromethylornithine, or the K(ATP) channel inhibitor, glibenclamide. These inhibitors also diminished the antimycin-induced hyperpolarization, as well as the antimycin-induced intracellular calcium increase, which was significantly dependent on extracellular calcium and was diminished by the inhibitor of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), dantrolene. Consistent with the importance of the CICR-dependent increase in capillary cell calcium, dantrolene significantly decreased hypoxia-induced capillary cell death. We also found that activation of the polyamine/K(ATP) channel/Ca(2+) influx/CICR pathway not only boosted the vulnerability of retinal capillaries to hypoxia, but also caused the contraction of capillary pericytes, whose vasoconstrictive effect may exacerbate hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS The vulnerability of retinal capillaries to hypoxia is boosted by a mechanism involving the polyamine/K(ATP) channel/Ca(2+) influx/CICR pathway. Discovery of this pathway should provide new targets for pharmacological interventions to minimize hypoxia-induced damage in retinal capillaries."

The mechanism for calcium (Ca2+) release in heart and skeletal muscle during excitation-contraction coupling is currently unknown. A widely held hypothesis is that a small amount of Ca2+ enters the cell and elicits a larger intracellular release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), termed \"Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release\" (CICR). In addition to its role in excitation-contraction coupling, Ca2+ is also known to activate the cysteine protease calpain, which has been recently found to specifically cleave the ryanodine receptor in vitro. The authors investigated the question of whether Ca2+ sensitive protease activation could account for an apparent CICR. The authors first reproduced the phenomenon of CICR using detergent treated L6 myotubes (\"skinned cells\"). Leupeptin, a cysteine protease inhibitor, reduced the initial velocity and extent of Ca2+ release from the SR; a similar result was obtained when skinned cells were treated with iodoacetate, a sulfhydryl alkylating agent. Dithiothreitol enhanced both the rate and extent of Ca2+ release. Caffeine-induced Ca2+-release was unaffected by the thiol protease inhibitors or activators. This suggests that a cysteine protease may be responsible, in part, for CICR in vitro. The authors also found that vesicles exposed to Ca2+ to induce CICR were unable to fully reaccumulate Ca2+ a second time. Yet, when caffeine released comparable amounts of Ca2+, the initial Ca2+ level was fully restored. Similarly, leupeptin protected the vesicles from the reaccumulation deficit induced by Ca2+. The authors' findings suggest that proteolysis activated by a Ca2+-sensitive protease may account for the direct in vitro demonstration of CICR; such an effect may more likely reflect a role in apoptosis than excitation-contraction coupling."

We studied the properties of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) and its regulation by inhibitors (caffeine, ryanodine, ruthenium red and procaine) in a multicellular atrial preparation that lacks T-tubules. CICR was elicited by application of brief (2-3 sec) calcium pulses (pCa 6.0-6.5). The transient contractions induced by these brief pulses were used to monitor the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in saponin-permeabilized chick atrial fibers. Prolonged (3-10 sec) calcium pulses produced contractions with a phasic CICR-mediated component followed by a tonic component due to direct activation of the myofilaments by calcium. Ryanodine (1 microM) suppressed the phasic but not the tonic contraction. CICR-mediated contractions are suppressed not only by ryanodine (IC50 = 23 nM), but also by ruthenium red (270 nM), procaine (8.1 mM) and millimolar caffeine. Ryanodine inhibits contractions mediated by CICR in a use-dependent manner, due to a strong requirement to act on the activated state of the calcium release channels. However, the blocking action of ryanodine does not require the presence of elevated myoplasmic calcium. A transient contraction occurs upon removal of procaine, which we attribute to unblocking of calcium release channels. Our previous studies of Ins(1,4,5)P3- and caffeine-induced calcium release together with the present work with CICR allow us to propose a model of SR calcium release mechanisms in avian atrial muscle in which corbular sarcoplasmic reticulum may participate."

CICR is defined as Ca2+ release by the action of Ca2+ alone without the simultaneous action of other activating processes. CICR is biphasically dependent on Ca2+ concentration; is inhibited by Mg2+, procaine, and tetracaine; and is potentiated by ATP, other adenine compounds, and caffeine. With depolarization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a potential change of the SR membrane in which the luminal side becomes more negative, CICR is activated for several seconds and is then inactivated. All three types of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) show CICR activity. At least one RyR, RyR1, also shows non-CICR Ca2+ release, such as that triggered by the t-tubule voltage sensor, by clofibric acid, and by SR depolarization. Maximum rates of CICR, at the optimal Ca2+ concentration in the presence of physiological levels of ATP and Mg2+ determined in skinned fibers and fragmented SR, are much lower than the rate of physiological Ca2+ release. The primary event of physiological Ca2+ release, the Ca2+ spark, is the simultaneous opening of multiple channels, the coordinating mechanism of which does not appear to be CICR because of the low probability of CICR opening under physiological conditions. The coordination may require Ca2+, but in that case, some other stimulus or stimuli must be provided simultaneously, which is not CICR by definition. Thus CICR does not appear to contribute significantly to physiological Ca2+ release. On the other hand, CICR appears to play a key role in caffeine contracture and malignant hyperthermia. The potentiation of voltage-activated Ca2+ release by caffeine, however, does not seem to occur through secondary CICR, although the site where caffeine potentiates voltage-activated Ca2+ release might be the same site where caffeine potentiates CICR."

Mutations in CHCHD10, a gene coding for a mitochondrial protein, are implicated in ALS-FTD spectrum disorders, which are pathologically characterized by transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) accumulation. While both TDP-43 and CHCHD10 mutations drive mitochondrial pathogenesis, mechanisms underlying such phenotypes are unclear. Moreover, despite the disruption of the mitochondrial mitofilin protein complex at cristae junctions in patient fibroblasts bearing the CHCHD10S59L mutation, the role of CHCHD10 variants in mitofilin-associated protein complexes in brain has not been examined. Here, we utilized novel CHCHD10 transgenic mouse variants (WT, R15L, & S59L), TDP-43 transgenic mice, FTLD-TDP patient brains, and transfected cells to assess the interplay between CHCHD10 and TDP-43 on mitochondrial phenotypes. We show that CHCHD10 mutations disrupt mitochondrial OPA1-mitofilin complexes in brain, associated with impaired mitochondrial fusion and respiration. Likewise, CHCHD10 levels and OPA1-mitofilin complexes are significantly reduced in brains of FTLD-TDP patients and TDP-43 transgenic mice. In cultured cells, CHCHD10 knockdown results in OPA1-mitofilin complex disassembly, while TDP-43 overexpression also reduces CHCHD10, promotes OPA1-mitofilin complex disassembly via CHCHD10, and impairs mitochondrial fusion and respiration, phenotypes that are rescued by wild type (WT) CHCHD10. These results indicate that disruption of CHCHD10-regulated OPA1-mitofilin complex contributes to mitochondrial abnormalities in FTLD-TDP and suggest that CHCHD10 restoration could ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction in FTLD-TDP."

We show that APOOL is a mitochondrial membrane protein facing the intermembrane space. It specifically binds to cardiolipin in vitro but not to the precursor lipid phosphatidylglycerol. Overexpression of APOOL led to fragmentation of mitochondria, a reduced basal oxygen consumption rate, and altered cristae morphology. Downregulation of APOOL impaired mitochondrial respiration and caused major alterations in cristae morphology. We further show that APOOL physically interacts with several subunits of the MINOS complex, namely Mitofilin, MINOS1, and SAMM50. We conclude that APOOL is a cardiolipin-binding component of the Mitofilin/MINOS protein complex determining cristae morphology in mammalian mitochondria.

The mitochondrial inner membrane contains a large protein complex crucial for membrane architecture, the mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS). MINOS is required for keeping cristae membranes attached to the inner boundary membrane via crista junctions and interacts with protein complexes of the mitochondrial outer membrane. To study if outer membrane interactions and maintenance of cristae morphology are directly coupled, we generated mutant forms of mitofilin/Fcj1 (formation of crista junction protein 1), a core component of MINOS. Mitofilin consists of a transmembrane anchor in the inner membrane and intermembrane space domains, including a coiled-coil domain and a conserved C-terminal domain. Deletion of the C-terminal domain disrupted the MINOS complex and led to release of cristae membranes from the inner boundary membrane, whereas the interaction of mitofilin with the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) were enhanced. Deletion of the coiled-coil domain also disturbed the MINOS complex and cristae morphology; however, the interactions of mitofilin with TOM and SAM were differentially affected. Finally, deletion of both intermembrane space domains disturbed MINOS integrity as well as interactions with TOM and SAM. Thus, the intermembrane space domains of mitofilin play distinct roles in interactions with outer membrane complexes and maintenance of MINOS and cristae morphology, demonstrating that MINOS contacts to TOM and SAM are not sufficient for the maintenance of inner membrane architecture."

Its components include inner mitochondrial membrane protein mitofilin and outer membrane protein Sam50. We identified a conserved, uncharacterized protein, C1orf163 [SEL1 repeat containing 1 protein (SELRC1)], as one of the proteins significantly reduced after the knockdown of Sam50 and mitofilin.

Sam50 depletion affects moderately the import and assembly of C1orf163 into two protein complexes of approximately 60kDa and 150kDa. We observe that the knockdown of C1orf163 leads to reduction of levels of proteins belonging to the OXPHOS complexes. The activity of complexes I and IV is reduced in C1orf163-depleted cells, and we observe the strongest defects in the assembly of complex IV.

Mutation of either immt-1 or immt-2 produced defects in germline development and egg-laying. These defects were exacerbated by the double mutation, which greatly reduced motility, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, decreased mitochondrial mass, and imparted resistance to oxidative stress. Cryo-electron microscopy and electron tomography revealed that each of the single mutations resulted in curved and stacked mitochondrial crista tubules as well as a reduced number of crista junctions. The immt-2 mutation was also associated with the presence of outer mitochondrial membrane pores, which were larger in the double mutant. IMMT-1 and IMMT-2 proteins were localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, as seen by immunoelectron microscopy, and they behaved as oligomers or large complexes with F(1)F(0) ATP synthase in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a predominantly nuclear enzyme that exerts numerous functions in cellular physiology and pathology, from maintenance of DNA stability to transcriptional regulation. Through a proteomic analysis of PARP-1 co-immunoprecipitation complexes, we identified Mitofilin, a mitochondrial protein, as a new PARP-1 interactor. This result prompted us to further investigate the presence and the role of the enzyme in mitochondria. Using laser confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis of purified mitochondria, we demonstrated the mitochondrial localization of a fraction of PARP-1. Further, the effects of overexpressing or down-regulating Mitofilin showed that this protein promotes and is required for PARP-1 mitochondrial localization. We also report several lines of evidence suggesting that intramitochondrial PARP-1 plays a role in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage signaling and/or repair. First, we show that PARP-1 binds to different regions throughout the mtDNA. Moreover, we demonstrated that the depletion of either PARP-1 or Mitofilin, which abrogates the mitochondrial localization of the enzyme, leads to the accumulation of mtDNA damage. Finally, we show that DNA ligase III, known to be required for mtDNA repair, participates in a PARP-1-containing complex bound to mtDNA.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS The multiple risk model postulates that accumulating risk factors increase adolescent drunkenness and smoking. The normalisation theory adds to this by arguing that the relation between accumulative risk and drunkenness and smoking is dependent on the distribution of these behaviours in the larger population. More concretely, normalisation theory predicts that: (i) when population level use increases, low risk adolescents will be more likely to use alcohol and cigarettes; and (ii) adolescents facing multiple risk factors will be equally likely to use alcohol and cigarettes, regardless of trends in population level use. The current study empirically tests these assumptions on five waves of nationally representative samples of Israeli Jewish youth. DESIGN AND METHODS Five cross-sectional waves of data from the Israeli Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey for Jewish 10th graders were used. Logistic regression models measured the impact of changes in population level use across waves on drunkenness and smoking, and their association with differing levels of risk factors. RESULTS Between zero and two risk factors, the risk of drunkenness and smoking increases for each additional risk factor. When reaching two risk factors, added risk does not significantly increase the likelihood of smoking and drunkenness. Changes in population level drunkenness and smoking did not systematically relate to changes in the individual level relationship between risk factors and smoking and drunkenness. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The pattern of results in this study provides strong evidence for the multiple risk factor model and inconsistent evidence for the normalisation theory.

For decades it has been assumed, that smoking within 6 hours of anesthesia and surgery raises the incidence of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications (PPC) including aspiration. Therefore, every patient is advised to stop smoking at the day before surgery, and not to smoke at all at the day of surgery. If the patient does not follow this advice, this will result in a postponement of anesthesia and surgery. The present article aims at re-investigating the scientific basis of this dogma in anesthesia, which virtually forbids smoking at short-term prior to surgery. The influence of short-term (6 h) abstinence from smoking on the perioperative pulmonary morbidity has not been systematically investigated. Interestingly, giving up smoking less than two months prior to surgery does not significantly decrease, but rather may increase the incidence of PPC. With respect to the risk of aspiration, smoking does not increase either the volume or the acidity of gastric juices. A short-lived reduction in the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter is reversible within minutes after termination of smoking. While the emptying of liquid gastric juices is not influenced by smoking, there is a certain delay in the propulgation of solid food. This effect, however, is probably of no clinical relevance in patients, who had their last solid meal the evening before surgery. Hence, we conclude that the anesthesia dogma, which rules out smoking shortly prior to anesthesia, cannot be based on an otherwise increased incidence of pulmonary aspiration or other pulmonary morbidity. However, acute smoking (probably by an increase in COHb) may increase the incidence of myocardial ischemia during exercise and anesthesia. With reference to this possible cardiac complication it still seems reasonable to discourage smoking at least 12 to 48 hours prior to surgery in patients with elevated cardiac risk."

In the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer (n=120,852 men and women), using a case-cohort design, adjusted incidence rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed for colorectal tumors with wild-type and with mutated KRAS gene, and with specific G:C-->T:A or G:C-->A:T point mutations in KRAS, according to cigarette smoking status, frequency, duration, pack years, age at first exposure, years since cessation, inhalation and filter usage. After 7.3 years and excluding the first 2.3 years, 648 cases and 4083 sub-cohort members were included in the analyses. Ex-smokers, but not current smokers, were at increased risk for colorectal cancer with wild-type KRAS gene tumors when compared with never smokers, albeit not statistically significant (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.96-1.66). This was not observed for KRAS mutated tumors when comparing ex-smokers with never smokers (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.79-1.66). The highest category of smoking frequency (>20 cigarettes/day) and inhalation of smoke were associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer with wild-type KRAS gene tumors, though not statistically significant, when compared with never smoking (frequency: RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.90-1.71 and inhalation: RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.94-1.67).

No associations were observed between any of the smoking characteristics and the risk for colorectal cancer with mutated KRAS gene tumors, nor where there any clear associations with tumors with specific G:C-->A:T transitions or G:C-->T:A transversions. These results suggest that, in contrast to the hypothesis, smoking does not increase the risk for colorectal tumors with a mutated KRAS gene.

Research suggests important cross-cultural differences in how smokers react to being targets of moralization. However, research has not examined whether smokers who agree with moralized sentiments about smoking are more willing to quit or reduce their smoking. Additionally, the mediating role of perceived personal risk has not been examined. METHODS In this study, representative samples of smokers in Denmark (a smoking lenient country; N = 429) and the United States (a smoking prohibitive country; N = 431) completed surveys 6 months apart. RESULTS As expected, Danish smokers (compared to U.S. smokers) moralized less and estimated that their personal risk of lung cancer was smaller. Furthermore, moralization at T1 predicted an increase in perceived personal risk at T2 (for Danish smokers and marginally for U.S. smokers), a decrease in smoking behaviors (for Danish smokers only), and an increase in quitting intentions (marginally for Danish smokers only). For Danish smokers, perceived personal risk mediated the relationship between moralization and quitting intentions. CONCLUSIONS Moralization predicted an increase in perceived personal risk, an increase in quitting intentions, and a reduction in smoking behaviors, especially for the Danish sample.

BACKGROUND The International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph) provides an opportunity to analyze the relationship between cigarette smoking and non-Hodgkin lymphoma with sufficient statistical power to consider non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype. The results from previous studies of this relationship have been inconsistent, likely due to the small sample sizes that arose from stratification by disease subtype. To clarify the role of cigarette smoking in the etiology of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we conducted a pooled analysis of original patient data from nine case-control studies of non-Hodgkin lymphoma conducted in the United States, Europe, and Australia. METHODS Original data were obtained from each study and uniformly coded. Risk estimates from fixed-effects and two-stage random-effects models were compared to determine the impact of interstudy heterogeneity. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were derived from unconditional logistic regression models, controlling for study center, age, sex, and race. RESULTS In our pooled study population of 6,594 cases and 8,892 controls, smoking was associated with slightly increased risk estimates (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.00-1.15). Stratification by non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype revealed that the most consistent association between cigarette smoking and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was observed among follicular lymphomas (n = 1452). Compared with nonsmokers, current smokers had a higher OR for follicular lymphoma (1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.52) than former smokers (1.06; 95% CI, 0.93-1.22). Current heavy smoking (> or = 36 pack-years) was associated with a 45% increased OR for follicular lymphoma (1.45; 95% CI, 1.15-1.82) compared with nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS Cigarette smoking may increase the risk of developing follicular lymphoma but does not seem to affect risk of the other non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes we examined. Future research is needed to determine the biological mechanism responsible for our subtype-specific results."

Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including NEB (nebulin), TPM2 (beta-tropomyosin), TPM3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and ACTA1 (skeletal alpha-actin). 20-25% of NM cases carry ACTA1 defects and these particular mutations usually induce substitutions of single residues in the actin protein. Despite increasing clinical and scientific interest, the contractile consequences of these subtle amino acid substitutions remain obscure. To decipher them, in the present study, we originally recorded and analysed the mechanics as well as the X-ray diffraction patterns of human membrane-permeabilized single muscle fibres with a particular peptide substitution in actin, i.e. p.Phe352Ser. Results unravelled an unexpected cascade of molecular and cellular events. During contraction, p.Phe352Ser greatly enhances the strain of individual cross-bridges. Paradoxically, p.Phe352Ser also slightly lowers the number of cross-bridges by altering the rate of myosin head attachment to actin monomers.

Three genes are known to cause nemaline myopathy: the genes for nebulin (NEB) on chromosome 2q22, slow alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3) on chromosome 1q21 and skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) on chromosome 1q42. We present a 39-year-old lady with a mild form of nemaline myopathy, whom we have followed over a period of 25 years. She presented at the age of 7 years with symptoms of mild axial and proximal muscle weakness. The overall course was essentially static, but at 36 years, she went into life-threatening respiratory failure, for which she is currently treated with night-time ventilation. Muscle biopsies at 12, 17 and 39 years of age showed typical nemaline rods, particularly in type 1 fibres. Areas with unevenness of oxidative stain were present in the second and third biopsies. The presence of rods and core-like areas was confirmed on electron microscopy. There was no detectable alteration in actin expression immunocytochemically.

Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common forms of congenital myopathy and it is identified by the presence of \"nemaline bodies\" (rods) in muscle fibers by histopathological examination. The most common forms of NM are caused by mutations in the Actin Alpha 1 (ACTA1) and Nebulin (NEB) genes. Clinical features include hypotonia and muscle weakness. Unfortunately, there is no curative treatment and the pathogenetic mechanisms remain unclear. In this manuscript, we examined the pathophysiological alterations in NM using dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with mutations in ACTA1 and NEB genes. Patients' fibroblasts were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to analyze the polymerization of actin filaments by fluorescence microscopy. We found that patients' fibroblasts showed incorrect actin filament polymerization compared to control fibroblasts. Actin filament polymerization defects were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, we identified two mitochondrial-boosting compounds, linoleic acid (LA) and L-carnitine (LCAR), that improved the formation of actin filaments in mutant fibroblasts and corrected mitochondrial bioenergetics. Our results indicate that cellular models can be useful to study the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in NM and to find new potential therapies. Furthermore, targeting mitochondrial dysfunction with LA and LCAR can revert the pathological alterations in NM cellular models."

Nemaline myopathy is characterized by muscle weakness and the presence of rod-like (nemaline) bodies. The genetic etiology of nemaline myopathy is becoming increasingly understood with mutations in ten genes now known to cause the disease. Despite this, the mechanism by which skeletal muscle weakness occurs remains elusive, with previous studies showing no correlation between the frequency of nemaline bodies and disease severity. To investigate the formation of nemaline bodies and their role in pathogenesis, we generated overexpression and loss-of-function zebrafish models for skeletal muscle \u03b1-actin (ACTA1) and nebulin (NEB). We identify three distinct types of nemaline bodies and visualize their formation in vivo, demonstrating these nemaline bodies not only exhibit different subcellular origins, but also have distinct pathological consequences within the skeletal muscle. One subtype is highly dynamic and upon breakdown leads to the accumulation of cytoplasmic actin contributing to muscle weakness. Examination of a Neb-deficient model suggests this mechanism may be common in nemaline myopathy. Another subtype results from a reduction of actin and forms a more stable cytoplasmic body. In contrast, the final type originates at the Z-disk and is associated with myofibrillar disorganization. Analysis of zebrafish and muscle biopsies from ACTA1 nemaline myopathy patients demonstrates that nemaline bodies also possess a different protein signature. In addition, we show that the ACTA1(D286G) mutation causes impaired actin incorporation and localization in the sarcomere. Together these data provide a novel examination of nemaline body origins and dynamics in vivo and identifies pathological changes that correlate with muscle weakness."

Nemaline myopathy is a heterogenous form of congenital myopathy characterised by a variable spectrum of clinical features, predominated in the severe form by profound muscle hypotonia and weakness accompanied by respiratory insufficiency. The clinical variability, with differing age of onset and severity of symptoms makes the diagnosis of nemaline myopathy difficult in some cases. Severe forms of nemaline myopathy may be caused by mutation of a number of different genes: skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1), nebulin (NEB) and alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3), all of which encode components of the sarcomeric thin filaments of skeletal muscle. We describe the severe form of nemaline myopathy diagnosed in two brothers who died at the age of 12 days and 9 months, due to respiratory insufficiency caused by severe muscle weakness. Polyhydramnios and weakness of foetal movements in the IIIrd trimester of pregnancy, as well as variable clinical severity were noted in both cases. Microscopically visible significant immaturity of muscle fibers was found in the skeletal muscle biopsy performed in one of the brothers. The diagnosis of nemaline myopathy was confirmed by the presence of nemaline bodies (rods) in sections stained using the Gomori trichrome method. Molecular studies of DNA isolated from blood leucocytes showed no mutation in the ACTA1 or the TPM3 genes. Linkage analysis with polymorphic markers did not rule out linkage to part of the NEB gene locus.

Early pathological events in ALS include perturbations in axonal transport (AT), formation of toxic protein aggregates and Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ) disruption, which all lead to axonal degeneration and motor neuron death. Pridopidine is a small molecule that has been clinically developed for Huntington disease. Here we tested the efficacy of pridopidine for ALS using in vitro and in vivo models.

Strikingly, in vivo evaluation of pridopidine in SOD1G93A mice reveals a profound reduction in mutant SOD1 aggregation in the spinal cord, and attenuation of NMJ disruption, as well as subsequent muscle wasting.

The tri-nucleotide repeat expansion underlying Huntington disease (HD) results in corticostriatal synaptic dysfunction and subsequent neurodegeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). HD is a devastating autosomal dominant disease with no disease-modifying treatments. Pridopidine, a postulated \"dopamine stabilizer\", has been shown to improve motor symptoms in clinical trials of HD. However, the target(s) and mechanism of action of pridopidine remain to be fully elucidated. As binding studies identified sigma-1 receptor (S1R) as a high-affinity receptor for pridopidine, we evaluated the relevance of S1R as a therapeutic target of pridopidine in HD. S1R is an endoplasmic reticulum - (ER) resident transmembrane protein and is regulated by ER calcium homeostasis, which is perturbed in HD. Consistent with ER calcium dysregulation, we observed striatal upregulation of S1R in aged YAC128 transgenic HD mice and HD patients. We previously demonstrated that dendritic MSN spines are lost in aged corticostriatal co-cultures from YAC128 mice. We report here that pridopidine and the chemically similar S1R agonist 3-PPP prevent MSN spine loss in aging YAC128 co-cultures. Spine protection was blocked by neuronal deletion of S1R. Pridopidine treatment suppressed supranormal ER Ca2+ release, restored ER calcium levels and reduced excessive store-operated calcium (SOC) entry in spines, which may account for its synaptoprotective effects. Normalization of ER Ca2+ levels by pridopidine was prevented by S1R deletion. To evaluate long-term effects of pridopidine, we analyzed expression profiles of calcium signaling genes. Pridopidine elevated striatal expression of calbindin and homer1a, whereas their striatal expression was reduced in aged Q175KI and YAC128 HD mouse models compared to WT. Pridopidine and 3-PPP are proposed to prevent calcium dysregulation and synaptic loss in a YAC128 corticostriatal co-culture model of HD. The actions of pridopidine were mediated by S1R and led to normalization of ER Ca2+ release, ER Ca2+ levels and spine SOC entry in YAC128 MSNs. This is a new potential mechanism of action for pridopidine, highlighting S1R as a potential target for HD therapy. Upregulation of striatal proteins that regulate calcium, including calbindin and homer1a, upon chronic therapy with pridopidine, may further contribute to long-term beneficial effects of pridopidine in HD."

Despite advances in understanding the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease (HD), there are currently no effective pharmacological agents available to treat core symptoms or to stop or prevent the progression of this hereditary neurodegenerative disorder. Pridopidine, a novel small molecule compound, has demonstrated potential for both symptomatic treatment and disease modifying effects in HD. While pridopidine failed to achieve its primary efficacy outcomes (Modified motor score) in two trials (MermaiHD and HART) there were consistent effects on secondary outcomes (TMS). In the most recent study (PrideHD) pridiopidine did not differ from placebo on TMS, possibly due to a large enduring placebo effect.This review describes the process, based on in vivo systems response profiling, by which pridopidine was discovered and discusses its pharmacological profile, aiming to provide a model for the system-level effects, and a rationale for the use of pridopidine in patients affected by HD. Considering the effects on brain neurochemistry, gene expression and behaviour in vivo, pridopidine displays a unique effect profile. A hallmark feature in the behavioural pharmacology of pridopidine is its state-dependent inhibition or activation of dopamine-dependent psychomotor functions. Such effects are paralleled by strengthening of synaptic connectivity in cortico-striatal pathways suggesting pridopidine has potential to modify phenotypic expression as well as progression of HD. The preclinical pharmacological profile is discussed with respect to the clinical results for pridopidine, and proposals are made for further investigation, including preclinical and clinical studies addressing disease progression and effects at different stages of HD."

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which new treatments are urgently needed. Pridopidine is a new dopaminergic stabilizer, recently developed for the treatment of motor symptoms associated with HD. The therapeutic effect of pridopidine in patients with HD has been determined in two double-blind randomized clinical trials, however, whether pridopidine exerts neuroprotection remains to be addressed. The main goal of this study was to define the potential neuroprotective effect of pridopidine, in HD in vivo and in vitro models, thus providing evidence that might support a potential disease-modifying action of the drug and possibly clarifying other aspects of pridopidine mode-of-action. Our data corroborated the hypothesis of neuroprotective action of pridopidine in HD experimental models. Administration of pridopidine protected cells from apoptosis, and resulted in highly improved motor performance in R6/2 mice. The anti-apoptotic effect observed in the in vitro system highlighted neuroprotective properties of the drug, and advanced the idea of sigma-1-receptor as an additional molecular target implicated in the mechanism of action of pridopidine. Coherent with protective effects, pridopidine-mediated beneficial effects in R6/2 mice were associated with an increased expression of pro-survival and neurostimulatory molecules, such as brain derived neurotrophic factor and DARPP32, and with a reduction in the size of mHtt aggregates in striatal tissues. Taken together, these findings support the theory of pridopidine as molecule with disease-modifying properties in HD and advance the idea of a valuable therapeutic strategy for effectively treating the disease."

BACKGROUND Huntington Disease (HD) is an incurable autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder driven by an expansion repeat giving rise to the mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt), which is known to disrupt a multitude of transcriptional pathways. Pridopidine, a small molecule in development for treatment of HD, has been shown to improve motor symptoms in HD patients. In HD animal models, pridopidine exerts neuroprotective effects and improves behavioral and motor functions. Pridopidine binds primarily to the sigma-1 receptor, (IC50 ~ 100 nM), which mediates its neuroprotective properties, such as rescue of spine density and aberrant calcium signaling in HD neuronal cultures. Pridopidine enhances brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secretion, which is blocked by putative sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100, and was shown to upregulate transcription of genes in the BDNF, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) pathways in the rat striatum. The impact of different doses of pridopidine on gene expression and transcript splicing in HD across relevant brain regions was explored, utilizing the YAC128 HD mouse model, which carries the entire human mHtt gene containing 128 CAG repeats. METHODS RNAseq was analyzed from striatum, cortex, and hippocampus of wild-type and YAC128 mice treated with vehicle, 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg pridopidine from the presymptomatic stage (1.5 months of age) until 11.5 months of age in which mice exhibit progressive disease phenotypes. RESULTS The most pronounced transcriptional effect of pridopidine at both doses was observed in the striatum with minimal effects in other regions. In addition, for the first time pridopidine was found to have a dose-dependent impact on alternative exon and junction usage, a regulatory mechanism known to be impaired in HD. In the striatum of YAC128 HD mice, pridopidine treatment initiation prior to symptomatic manifestation rescues the impaired expression of the BDNF, GR, D1R and cAMP pathways. CONCLUSIONS Pridopidine has broad effects on restoring transcriptomic disturbances in the striatum, particularly involving synaptic transmission and activating neuroprotective pathways that are disturbed in HD. Benefits of treatment initiation at early disease stages track with trends observed in the clinic."

The dopaminergic stabilizer pridopidine demonstrates state-dependent effects on locomotor activity, counteracting both hypo- and hyperactivity in rats. Pridopidine has been shown to display both functional dopamine D2 receptor antagonist properties and increase in biomarkers associated with NMDA-mediated glutamate transmission in the frontal cortex. To further characterise the effects of pridopidine on prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons, a series of in vivo electrophysiological studies were performed in urethane-anaesthetised rats. Pridopidine, administered at doses from 10 to 60 mg/kg (i.v.), dose dependently increased pyramidal cell firing in the majority of the neurons tested. Pridopidine induced a significant increase of 162 % in mean firing activity of PFC neurons, versus initial basal firing activity as the cumulative dose of 30 mg/kg, i.v., was administered. This enhancement of activity was due to increased firing frequency of already spontaneously active neurons, rather than an increase in population activity. The increase was partially reversed or prevented by a sub-threshold dose of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.). Microiontophoretic application of pridopidine had only moderate activating effects. The selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist A-68930 also had limited effects when administered by microiontophoretic application, but exerted a dose dependent (0.2-3 mg/kg, i.v.) activation of firing in the majority of neurons tested (10/16). However, inhibition of firing by systemic administration of A-68930 was also observed in a subgroup of neurons (6/16). Both activation and inhibition of firing induced by systemic administration of A-68930 were reversed by the systemic administration of SCH23390. The present data suggests that pridopidine enhances pyramidal cell firing via an indirect dopamine D1 receptor-mediated mechanism. These effects of pridopidine may serve to strengthen the cortico-striatal communication and to improve motor control in Huntington's disease for which pridopidine is currently in development."

OBJECTIVES Huntington disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder resulting in loss of motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions and is characterized by a distinctive pattern of cerebral metabolic abnormalities. Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a novel class of central nervous system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntington disease. The objective of the study was to investigate the metabolic changes in patients with Huntington disease before and after pridopidine treatment. METHODS [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging was used to measure the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose at baseline and after 14 days of open-label pridopidine treatment in 8 patients with Huntington disease. Clinical assessments were performed using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS Statistical parametric mapping analysis showed increased metabolic activity in several brain regions such as the precuneus and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus after treatment. In addition, after pridopidine treatment, the correlation between the clinical status and the cerebral metabolic activity was strengthened. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that pridopidine induces metabolic changes in brain regions implicated as important for mediating compensatory mechanisms in Huntington disease. In addition, the finding of a strong relationship between clinical severity and metabolic activity after treatment also suggests that pridopidine treatment targets a Huntington disease-related metabolic activity pattern."

BACKGROUND Huntington's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by motor, cognitive, and behavioural deficits. Pridopidine belongs to a new class of compounds known as dopaminergic stabilisers, and results from a small phase 2 study in patients with Huntington's disease suggested that this drug might improve voluntary motor function. We aimed to assess further the effects of pridopidine in patients with Huntington's disease. METHODS We undertook a 6 month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of pridopidine in the treatment of motor deficits in patients with Huntington's disease. Our primary endpoint was change in the modified motor score (mMS; derived from the unified Huntington's disease rating scale) at 26 weeks. We recruited patients with Huntington's disease from 32 European centres; patients were aged 30 years or older and had an mMS of 10 points or greater at baseline. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive placebo, 45 mg per day pridopidine, or 90 mg per day pridopidine by use of centralised computer-generated codes. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. We also assessed the safety and tolerability profile of pridopidine. For our primary analysis, all patients were eligible for inclusion in our full analysis set, in which we used the last observation carried forward method for missing values. We used an analysis of covariance model and the Bonferroni method to adjust for multiple comparisons. We used a prespecified per-protocol population as our sensitivity analysis. The \u03b1 level was 0\u00b7025 for our primary analysis and 0\u00b705 overall. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00665223. FINDINGS At 26 weeks, in our full analysis set the difference in mean mMS was -0\u00b799 points (97\u00b75% CI -2\u00b708 to 0\u00b710, p=0\u00b7042) in patients who received 90 mg per day pridopidine (n=145) versus those who received placebo (n=144), and -0\u00b736 points (-1\u00b744 to 0\u00b772, p=0\u00b7456) in those who received 45 mg per day pridopidine (n=148) versus those who received placebo. At the 90 mg per day dose, in our per-protocol population (n=114), the reduction in the mMS was of -1\u00b729 points (-2\u00b747 to -0\u00b712; p=0\u00b7014) compared with placebo (n=120). We did not identify any changes in non-motor endpoints at either dose. Pridopidine was well tolerated and had an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo. INTERPRETATION This study did not provide evidence of efficacy as measured by the mMS, but a potential effect of pridopidine on the motor phenotype of Huntington's disease merits further investigation. Pridopidine up to 90 mg per day was well tolerated in patients with Huntington's disease. FUNDING NeuroSearch A/S."

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the dopaminergic stabilizer pridopidine (ACR16) in patients with Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week trial, patients with HD received pridopidine (50 mg/d, n = 28) or placebo (n = 30). The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in weighted cognitive score, assessed by cognitive tests (Symbol Digit Modalities, verbal fluency, and Stroop tests). Secondary outcome measures included changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, Reitan Trail-Making Test A, and Clinical Global Impression of Change. Safety assessments were also performed. RESULTS There was no significant difference between pridopidine and placebo in the change from baseline of the weighted cognitive score. However, secondary measures such as affective symptoms showed trends toward improvement, and there was significant improvement in voluntary motor symptoms compared with placebo (P < 0.05). Pridopidine was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to placebo. CONCLUSIONS Pridopidine shows promise as a treatment for some of the symptoms of HD. In this small-scale study, the most notable effect was improvement in voluntary motor symptoms. Larger, longer-term trials are warranted."

Originally developed as a dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) ligand, pridopidine displays about 100-fold higher affinity for the sigma-1 receptor (sigma-1R). Interestingly, pridopidine slows disease progression and improves motor function in Huntington's disease model mice and, in preliminarily reports, Huntington's disease patients. The present study examined the anti-amnesic potential of pridopidine. Thus, memory impairment was produced in mice by administration of phencyclidine (PCP, 10 mg/kg/day) for 10 days, followed by 14 days' treatment with pridopidine (6 mg/kg/day), or saline. Finally, novel object recognition performance was assessed in the animals. Mice receiving PCP and saline exhibited deficits in novel object recognition, as expected, while pridopidine treatment counteracted PCP-induced memory impairment. The effect of pridopidine was attenuated by co-administration of the sigma receptor antagonist, NE-100 (10 mg/kg). Our results suggest that pridopidine exerts anti-amnesic and potentially neuroprotective actions. These data provide new insights into the therapeutic potential of pridopidine as a pro-cognitive drug."

BACKGROUND Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare, clinically heterogeneous, congenital red cell aplasia: 40% of patients have congenital abnormalities. Recent studies have shown that in western countries, the disease is associated with heterozygous mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) genes in about 50% of patients. There have been no studies to determine the incidence of these mutations in Asian patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. DESIGN AND METHODS We screened 49 Japanese patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (45 probands) for mutations in the six known genes associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia: RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A. RPS14 was also examined due to its implied involvement in 5q- syndrome. RESULTS Mutations in RPS19, RPL5, RPL11 and RPS17 were identified in five, four, two and one of the probands, respectively. In total, 12 (27%) of the Japanese Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients had mutations in ribosomal protein genes. No mutations were detected in RPS14, RPS24 or RPL35A. All patients with RPS19 and RPL5 mutations had physical abnormalities. Remarkably, cleft palate was seen in two patients with RPL5 mutations, and thumb anomalies were seen in six patients with an RPS19 or RPL5 mutation. In contrast, a small-for-date phenotype was seen in five patients without an RPL5 mutation. CONCLUSIONS We observed a slightly lower frequency of mutations in the ribosomal protein genes in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia compared to the frequency reported in western countries. Genotype-phenotype data suggest an association between anomalies and RPS19 mutations, and a negative association between small-for-date phenotype and RPL5 mutations."

Because most mutations are loss of function and detected by direct sequencing of coding exons, we reasoned that part of the approximately 50% mutation negative patients may have carried a copy number variant of ribosomal protein genes. As a proof of concept, we designed a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay targeted to screen the six genes that are most frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients: RPS17, RPS19, RPS26, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A. Using this assay we showed that deletions represent approximately 20% of all mutations.

BACKGROUND Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare, pure red blood cell aplasia of childhood due to an intrinsic defect in erythropoietic progenitors. About 40% of patients display various malformations. Anemia is corrected by steroid treatment in more than 50% of cases; non-responders need chronic transfusions or stem cell transplantation. Defects in the RPS19 gene, encoding the ribosomal protein S19, are the main known cause of Diamond-Blackfan anemia and account for more than 25% of cases. Mutations in RPS24, RPS17, and RPL35A described in a minority of patients show that Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a disorder of ribosome biogenesis. Two new genes (RPL5, RPL11), encoding for ribosomal proteins of the large subunit, have been reported to be involved in a considerable percentage of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS In this genotype-phenotype analysis we screened the coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries of RPS14, RPS16, RPS24, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A in 92 Italian patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia who were negative for RPS19 mutations. RESULTS About 20% of the patients screened had mutations in RPL5 or RPL11, and only 1.6% in RPS24. All but three mutations that we report here are new mutations. No mutations were found in RPS14, RPS16, or RPL35A. Remarkably, we observed a higher percentage of somatic malformations in patients with RPL5 and RPL11 mutations. A close association was evident between RPL5 mutations and craniofacial malformations, and between hand malformations and RPL11 mutations. CONCLUSIONS Mutations in four ribosomal proteins account for around 50% of all cases of Diamond-Blackfan anemia in Italian patients. Genotype-phenotype data suggest that mutation screening should begin with RPL5 and RPL11 in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia with malformations."

Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by red blood cell (RBC) aplasia with varied malformations in infants. Elevated activity of adenosine deaminase (ADA) has been considered as a useful biomarker of Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and ADA assay has been shown to be more sensitive than genetic diagnosis. Approximately, 80% of the examined patients showed elevated ADA activity, whereas genetic tests of ribosome subunit genes identified mutations in approximately 60% of the patients. We previously reported that reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in RBCs may serve as a biomarker of Diamond-Blackfan anemia. In this study, to confirm the universality of our data, we extended the analysis to seven RBC enzymes and GSH of 14 patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia and performed a cross-analysis study using enzyme activity assay and recently reported proteome data. Statistical analysis revealed that both data exhibited high similarity, upregulation in the hexokinase and pentose-phosphate pathway, and downregulation in glycolytic enzymes such as phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, in the RBCs obtained from the subjects with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. The only discrepancy between enzyme activity and proteome data was observed in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), as increased G6PD activity showed no relation with the significant elevation in protein levels. These results suggest that our enzymatic activity data of Diamond-Blackfan anemia are universal and that the enzymatic activation of G6PD via a hitherto-unveiled mechanism is another metabolic feature of RBCs of Diamond-Blackfan anemia."

BACKGROUND Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a fatal congenital anemia characterized by a specific disruption in erythroid progenitor cell development. Approximately 25% of patients have mutations in the ribosomal protein RPS19 suggesting that Diamond-Blackfan anemia may be caused by a defect in ribosome biogenesis and translation. However, it is unclear how these defects specifically disrupt early erythropoiesis. Recent studies have shown that the retroviral receptor/heme exporter FLVCR1 is critical for early erythropoiesis. FLVCR1 null mice, despite dying in utero and having reduced myeloid and lymphoid cell growth, show a disruption in early erythropoiesis and have craniofacial and limb deformities similar to those found in some Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients. DESIGN AND METHODS In this study, we recapitulated the Diamond-Blackfan anemia hematologic features of reduced erythropoiesis but normal myelopoiesis by disrupting FLVCR1 in human hematopoietic stem cells. RESULTS We found that CD71(high) cells, which are enriched for immature erythroid cells, from Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients negative for RPS19 gene mutations express alternatively spliced isoforms of FLVCR1 transcript which encode proteins whose expression and function are disrupted. More importantly, our results suggest alternative splicing of FLVCR1 is significantly enhanced in Diamond-Blackfan anemia immature erythroid cells. Furthermore, we also observed enhanced FLVCR1 alternative splicing and a dramatic reduction of FLVCR1 protein expression in RPS19 down-regulated human K562 cells, which were used as a model to represent RPS19 gene mutated Diamond-Blackfan anemia. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, our results suggest enhanced alternative splicing of FLVCR1 transcripts and subsequent FLVCR1 insufficiency as an additional contributing factor to the erythropoietic defect observed in Diamond-Blackfan anemia."

Approximately 25% of cases of Diamond Blackfan anemia, a severe hypoplastic anemia, are linked to heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 that result in haploinsufficiency for this protein. Here we show that deletion of either of the two genes encoding Rps19 in yeast severely affects the production of 40 S ribosomal subunits. Rps19 is an essential protein that is strictly required for maturation of the 3'-end of 18 S rRNA. Depletion of Rps19 results in the accumulation of aberrant pre-40 S particles retained in the nucleus that fail to associate with pre-ribosomal factors involved in late maturation steps, including Enp1, Tsr1, and Rio2. When introduced in yeast Rps19, amino acid substitutions found in Diamond Blackfan anemia patients induce defects in the processing of the pre-rRNA similar to those observed in cells under-expressing Rps19. These results uncover a pivotal role of Rps19 in the assembly and maturation of the pre-40 S particles and demonstrate for the first time the effect of Diamond Blackfan anemia-associated mutations on the function of Rps19, strongly connecting the pathology to ribosome biogenesis."

Similarly, an analysis of covariance was used to assess whether baseline disease severity predicted biomarker change at week 12. RESULTS A total of 427 patients who received \u22651 dose of study drug and had baseline and \u22651 on-therapy primary efficacy evaluations were included in the analysis. At baseline, there was a statistically significant although weak correlation between levels of IL-6 and BDNF (Spearman correlation coefficient [rs]=0.120; P=0.014), but no significant correlation between baseline biomarker levels and baseline HAM-D17 total score (absolute value of all rs, \u22640.061). Desvenlafaxine 50mg/d treatment significantly reduced HAM-D17 total score from baseline at week 12 compared with placebo (P=0.006), but the three potential biomarkers did not predict treatment effects. No significant correlations were observed between the change from baseline in any biomarker level and change in HAM-D17 total score at week 12, either overall, or in desvenlafaxine or placebo groups (absolute value of all rs, 0.003-0.196). Baseline levels of BDNF, IL-6, and salivary cortisol did not significantly predict response to treatment at week 12. Although median increase in BDNF was not significantly different between desvenlafaxine (13.7%) and placebo (5.7%) groups, the increase was significantly greater (33.4% vs 4.3%; P=0.003) in patients with more severe depression at baseline (HAM-D17>22) vs those with less severe depression (HAM-D17\u226422). No similar findings were observed for IL-6 or salivary cortisol. DISCUSSION Weak or no relationships were observed at baseline between the potential biomarkers or between biomarkers and disease severity. While baseline biomarker level did not predict treatment response, improvement in BDNF was significantly greater among patients who were more severely depressed at baseline."

INTRODUCTION The safety and tolerability profiles of antidepressants can often influence the treatment choices of clinicians treating major depressive disorder. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the safety and tolerability of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate) in treating depression. METHODS An integrated analysis of all short-term, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled registration studies for major depressive disorder (four flexible-dose and five fixed-dose studies) was performed. Adult outpatients with major depressive disorder received desvenlafaxine doses ranging from 50-400 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks. Treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs, and discontinuation symptoms were evaluated. In the subset of fixed-dose studies, dose-related effects were analyzed. RESULTS In the overall population (placebo: n=1,116; desvenlafaxine: n=1,834), adverse events resulted in discontinuations in 3% of placebo-treated patients and 12% of desvenlafaxine-treated patients; in the subset of fixed-dose studies, the rates were 4% with placebo and increased with desvenlafaxine dose (50 mg/day: 4%; 400 mg/day: 18%). The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was transient nausea that was generally mild to moderate. The most common sexual dysfunction associated with desvenlafaxine treatment was erectile dysfunction in men (7% vs 1% with placebo) and anorgasmia in women (1% and 0%). One desvenlafaxine-treated patient died of a completed suicide; there were four suicide attempts (three desvenlafaxine, one placebo) and eight cases of suicidal ideation (five desvenlafaxine, three placebo) during the on-therapy period. Small but statistically significant changes in mean blood pressure occurred at all desvenlafaxine doses; clinically meaningful changes were observed in 1% of placebo-treated patients and 2% of desvenlafaxine-treated patients. Desvenlafaxine was associated with small but statistically significant mean changes in laboratory assessments, particularly lipid and liver enzyme elevations, and electrocardiograms; few cases of these changes were clinically relevant. CONCLUSION Desvenlafaxine in the treatment of major depressive disorder exhibited a safety and tolerability profile generally consistent with the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor class. The most common adverse event was transient nausea. At the recommended therapeutic dose of 50 mg/day, discontinuation due to adverse events was similar to placebo."

This study characterises the extent of desvenlafaxine transfer into milk and provides data on infant exposure to desvenlafaxine via breast milk in ten women with postnatal depression and their breastfed infants. Desvenlafaxine concentration in milk and plasma was measured chromatographically in milk and in maternal and infant plasma collected at steady state. Theoretic and relative infant doses via milk were estimated and the per cent drug in infant versus mother's plasma was calculated. Theoretic infant dose via milk was 85 (53-117) \u03bcg kg(-1) day(-1) (mean and 95% confidence interval) and relative infant dose was 6.8% (5.5-8.1%). The ratio of drug in infant/maternal plasma also gave an infant exposure estimate of 4.8% (3.5-6.2%) for all ten infants and 5.3% (4.2-5.7%) in the eight infants who were exclusively breastfed. No adverse effects were seen in the infants. The relative infant dose was similar to that for previous studies using venlafaxine and was supported by a separate exposure measure using the ratio of drug in the infant's plasma relative to that in the mother's plasma. The theoretic infant dose of desvenlafaxine was 41-45% of that for venlafaxine and its metabolite desvenlafaxine in previous studies, reflecting the lower recommended maternal dose for desvenlafaxine. Although our data for desvenlafaxine use in lactation are encouraging and there are supporting data from venlafaxine studies, more patients and their infants need to be studied before the safety of desvenlafaxine as a single therapeutic agent can be fully assessed."

PURPOSE To assess the effects of venlafaxine extended-release (XR) capsules and desvenlafaxine extended-release (XR) tablets upon indinavir pharmacokinetic properties when co-administrated to healthy volunteers. METHODS This was an open-label, two-period, fixed-dose study conducted at the clinical research unit located on a university campus. Twenty-four healthy volunteers enrolled in the study (mean age 28.3 \u00b1 8.0 years). Each subject received a single dose of indinavir 800 mg on day 1. Subsequently, subjects were then randomly assigned to either the venlafaxine XR group (N = 12) or the desvenlafaxine XR group (N = 12). Starting on day 2, venlafaxine XR was dosed at 37.5 mg/day for 4 days and increased to 75 mg/day for 6 days. Desvenlafaxine XR was dosed at 50 mg/day for 10 days. On day 12, indivanvir 800 mg was co-administered to both the venlafaxine XR and the desvenlafaxine XR groups. The pharmacokinetics of indinavir were determined both before and at the end of antidepressant dosing. Plasma indinavir, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine concentrations were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultra-violet (UV) detection. Indinavir pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis using validated computer software. RESULTS Venlafaxine XR and desvenlafaxine XR did not produce any significant changes in indinavir disposition. Both antidepressants were well tolerated by the subjects with only minor adverse side effects. CONCLUSIONS No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was demonstrated between venlafaxine XR and indinavir or between desvenlafaxine XR and indinvair. The lack of interaction could be due to the venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine extended-release formulation."

The chronic course of major depressive disorder (MDD) often impedes the ability of patients to achieve full remission. Return of full functioning is a critical goal of antidepressant pharmacotherapy as the presence of residual depressive symptoms is associated with an increased risk of relapse. Treatment guidelines recommend selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or atypical antidepressants as first-line treatment for moderate to severe MDD. Desvenlafaxine, administered as desvenlafaxine succinate, is an serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor approved for the treatment of adults with MDD at the recommended dose of 50 mg/day. The aim of this integrated analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of desvenlafaxine 50 and 100 mg/day compared with placebo in adult outpatients with MDD. The analysis used data from nine fixed-dose, short-term, placebo-controlled studies in adult outpatients diagnosed with MDD who had depressive symptoms for at least 30 days. Data from 4279 and 4317 patients were pooled for the efficacy and safety analyses, respectively. Statistically significant improvements were observed with desvenlafaxine 50 and 100 mg/day versus placebo for all efficacy endpoints assessed, including improvements in depressive symptoms, response and remission rates, as well as functional and cognitive outcomes. Treatment with desvenlafaxine 50 and 100 mg/day was generally safe and well tolerated. The findings of this integrated analysis of data from a large population of patients with MDD confirmed the antidepressant efficacy of both desvenlafaxine doses and add to previous evidence supporting the efficacy of desvenlafaxine."

BACKGROUND In an effort to establish the lowest effective dose of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), we assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 10- and 50-mg/day desvenlafaxine vs placebo for the treatment of major depressive disorder. METHODS Adult outpatients with DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) total score \u226520 were randomly assigned to receive placebo or desvenlafaxine (10 or 50 mg/day) after a 6- to 14-day single-blind placebo lead-in period in an 8-week, phase 3, fixed-dose trial. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in the HAM-D(17) score analyzed using analysis of covariance. Efficacy analyses were conducted with the intent-to-treat population, using the last observation carried forward. RESULTS The intent-to-treat population included 673 patients. Change from baseline to final evaluation in adjusted HAM-D(17) total scores was not significantly different comparing desvenlafaxine 10 mg/day (-9.28) and desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day (-8.92) with placebo (-8.42). There were no differences among treatment groups in the rates of treatment response or remission. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 1.8%, 0.9%, and 1.8% of patients in the placebo and desvenlafaxine 10- and 50-mg/day groups, respectively. Overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events with both doses were similar to placebo. CONCLUSIONS Both doses of desvenlafaxine failed to separate from placebo. However, in a companion study reported separately, desvenlafaxine 50 mg, but not 25 mg, separated from placebo. Taken together, these studies suggest that 50 mg is the minimum effective dose of desvenlafaxine for the treatment of major depressive disorder.

BACKGROUND Recent data suggest that GATA-4 is an antiapoptotic factor required for adaptive responses and a key regulator of hypertrophy and hypertrophy-associated genes in the heart. As a leading cause of chronic heart failure, reversal of postinfarction left ventricular remodeling represents an important target for therapeutic interventions. Here, we studied the role of GATA-4 as a mediator of postinfarction remodeling in rats. METHODS AND RESULTS Myocardial infarction, caused by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery, significantly decreased the DNA binding activity of GATA-4 at day 1, whereas at 2 weeks the GATA-4 DNA binding was significantly upregulated. To determine the functional role of GATA-4, peri-infarct intramyocardial delivery of adenoviral vector expressing GATA-4 was done before left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Hearts treated with GATA-4 gene transfer exhibited significantly increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening. Accordingly, infarct size was significantly reduced. To determine the cardioprotective mechanisms of GATA-4, myocardial angiogenesis, rate of apoptosis, c-kit+ cardiac stemlike cells, and genes regulated by GATA-4 were studied. The number of capillaries and stemlike cells was significantly increased, and decreased apoptosis was observed. CONCLUSION These results indicate that the reversal of reduced GATA-4 activity prevents adverse postinfarction remodeling through myocardial angiogenesis, antiapoptosis, and stem cell recruitment. GATA-4-based gene transfer may represent a novel, efficient therapeutic approach for heart failure."

BACKGROUND Left ventricular (LV) remodeling after myocardial infarction is associated with hypertrophy of surviving myocytes and represents a major process that leads to heart failure. One of the intrinsic histone acetyltransferases, p300, serves as a coactivator of hypertrophy-responsive transcriptional factors such as a cardiac zinc finger protein GATA-4 and is involved in its hypertrophic stimulus-induced acetylation and DNA binding. However, the role of p300-histone acetyltransferase activity in LV remodeling after myocardial infarction in vivo is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS To solve this problem, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing intact p300 or mutant p300 in the heart. As the result of its 2-amino acid substitution in the p300-histone acetyltransferase domain, this mutant lost its histone acetyltransferase activity and was unable to activate GATA-4-dependent transcription. The two kinds of transgenic mice and the wild-type mice were subjected to myocardial infarction or sham operation at the age of 12 weeks. Intact p300 transgenic mice showed significantly more progressive LV dilation and diminished systolic function after myocardial infarction than wild-type mice, whereas mutant p300 transgenic mice did not show this. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that cardiac overexpression of p300 promotes LV remodeling after myocardial infarction in adult mice in vivo and that histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 is required for these processes."

Background Stress-induced cell premature senescence participates in a variety of tissue and organ remodeling by secreting such proteins as proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. However, the role of cardiomyocyte senescence in heart remodeling after acute myocardial infarction has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. Therefore, we sought to clarify the impact of premature myocardial senescence on postinfarction heart function. Methods and Results Senescence markers, including p16 INK4a, p21 CIP1/WAF1, and SA -\u03b2-gal staining, were analyzed in several heart disease models by immunostaining. Both postinfarction mouse hearts and ischemic human myocardium demonstrated increased senescence markers. Additionally, senescence-related secretory phenotype was activated after acute myocardial infarction, which upregulated senescence-related secretory phenotype factors, including CCN family member 1 ( CCN 1), interleukin-1\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. In vivo, a tail vein injection of AAV 9- Gata4-sh RNA significantly attenuated senescence-related secretory phenotype secretion and aggravated postinfarction heart dysfunction. Furthermore, among activated senescence-related secretory phenotype factors, CCN 1 administration reduced myofibroblast viability in vitro and rescued the deleterious effect of AAV 9- Gata4-sh RNA in vivo. Conclusions Myocardial premature senescence was observed in the ischemic hearts and improved postinfarction heart function, partly through the GATA-binding factor 4- CCN 1 pathway."

BACKGROUND The heart is a highly vascular organ and prolonged interruption of myocardial blood flow initiates events that culminate in cardiac myocyte death. Proposed experimental reparative strategies include harvesting potent cells followed by direct injection into ischemic myocardium to achieve myogenesis and angiogenesis. METHODS Accordingly, we set out to isolate and expand a purified population of adult rat putative cardiomyocyte precursors, and to identify their characteristics in vitro. By using an acute myocardial infarction model and direct cell implantation, we further tested the hypothesis that these cells are an ideal cell source for myocardial regeneration and can enhance cardiac repair after implantation into the ischemic rat heart. RESULTS We describe here the identification of a subpopulation of primitive cells from rat heart, processing stem cell marker, c-kit and myogenic transcriptional factors, GATA-4 and MEF 2C, and cardiac specific proteins, troponin-I, alpha-sarcomeric actinin and connexin-43. They exhibited a high in vitro proliferative potential. These findings strongly suggest that these cells are putative cardiomyocyte precursors. After transplantation, they were able to be retained and proliferate (13.63 +/- 5.97% after 2 weeks) within the ischemic heart. Progeny of implanted cells migrated along the infarcted scar, reconstituted regenerated cardiomyocytes with incorporation into host myocardium, and inhibited cardiac remodeling with decreased scar formation.

BACKGROUND Heart diseases are the primary cause of death all over the world. Following myocardial infarction, billions of cells die, resulting in a huge loss of cardiac function. Stem cell-based therapies have appeared as a new area to support heart regeneration. The transcription factors GATA binding protein 4 (GATA-4) and myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) are considered prominent factors in the development of the cardiovascular system. AIM To explore the potential of GATA-4 and MEF2C for the cardiac differentiation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs). METHODS hUC-MSCs were characterized morphologically and immunologically by the presence of specific markers of MSCs via immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry, and by their potential to differentiate into osteocytes and adipocytes. hUC-MSCs were transfected with GATA-4, MEF2C, and their combination to direct the differentiation. Cardiac differentiation was confirmed by semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS hUC-MSCs expressed specific cell surface markers CD105, CD90, CD44, and vimentin but lack the expression of CD45. The transcription factors GATA-4 and MEF2C, and their combination induced differentiation in hUC-MSCs with significant expression of cardiac genes i.e., GATA-4, MEF2C, NK2 homeobox 5 (NKX2.5), MHC, and connexin-43, and cardiac proteins GATA-4, NKX2.5, cardiac troponin T, and connexin-43.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is released in response to myocardial infarction and may play a role in regulating cardiac remodeling. Recently, HGF was found to inhibit the apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells. Because GATA-4 can induce cell survival, the effects of HGF on GATA-4 activity were investigated. Treatment of HL-1 cells or primary adult rat cardiac myocytes with HGF, at concentrations that can be detected in the human serum after myocardial infarction, rapidly enhances GATA-4 DNA-binding activity. The enhanced DNA-binding activity is associated with the phosphorylation of GATA-4. HGF-induced phosphorylation and activation of GATA-4 is abolished by MEK inhibitors or the mutation of the ERK phosphorylation site (S105A), suggesting that HGF activates GATA-4 via MEK-ERK pathway-dependent phosphorylation. HGF enhances the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L), and this is blocked by dominant negative mutants of MEK or GATA-4. Forced expression of wild-type GATA-4, but not the GATA-4 mutant (S105A) increases the expression of Bcl-x(L). Furthermore, expression of the GATA-4 mutant (S105A) suppresses HGF-mediated protection of cells against daunorubicin-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that HGF protects cardiac muscle cells against apoptosis via a signaling pathway involving MEK/ERK-dependent phosphorylation of GATA-4."

Two key issues remain to translate findings in model organisms to future therapies in humans: what is the mechanism and can cardiac regeneration indeed occur in newborn humans? OBJECTIVE To assess whether human neonatal hearts can functionally recover after myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS Here, we report the case of a newborn child having a severe myocardial infarction due to coronary artery occlusion. The child developed massive cardiac damage as defined by serum markers for cardiomyocyte cell death, electrocardiograms, echocardiography, and cardiac angiography. Remarkably, within weeks after the initial ischemic insult, we observed functional cardiac recovery, which translated into long-term normal heart function. CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that, similar to neonatal rodents, newborn humans might have the intrinsic capacity to repair myocardial damage and completely recover cardiac function."

Myocardial infarction that causes damage to heart muscle can lead to heart failure. The identification of molecular mechanisms promoting myocardial regeneration represents a promising strategy to improve cardiac function. Here we show that IGF2BP3 plays an important role in regulating adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration in a mouse model of myocardial infarction. IGF2BP3 expression progressively decreases during postnatal development and becomes undetectable in the adult heart. However, it becomes upregulated after cardiac injury. Both gain- and loss-of-function analyses indicate that IGF2BP3 regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In particular, IGF2BP3 promotes cardiac regeneration and improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that IGF2BP3 binds to and stabilizes MMP3 mRNA through interaction with N6-methyladenosine modification. The expression of MMP3 protein is also progressively downregulated during postnatal development. Functional analyses indicate that MMP3 acts downstream of IGF2BP3 to regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation. These results suggest that IGF2BP3-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of extracellular matrix and tissue remodeling contributes to cardiomyocyte regeneration. They should help to define therapeutic strategy for ameliorating myocardial infarction by inducing cell proliferation and heart repair."

Apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells plays important roles in the development of various heart diseases including myocardial infarction and anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of cardiac myocyte apoptosis and survival is important for establishing therapeutic strategies against heart disease. Our recent experiments demonstrate that the GATA-4 transcription factor not only mediates cardiac hypertrophy, but also regulates apoptosis and survival of adult cardiac muscle cells. Apoptosis induced by anthracyclines is associated with decreased expression of GATA-4, while the restoration of GATA-4 levels via ectopic expression attenuated the apoptosis. Survival factors of cardiac myocytes such as hepatocyte growth factor and endothelin-1 activate GATA-4, and this signal transduction mechanism at least in part serves to protect the heart against oxidative stress."

We compared the Tokuhashi and Tomita scoring systems, two commonly used scoring systems for prognosis in spinal metastases. We also assessed the different variables separately with respect to their value in predicting postsurgical life expectancy. Finally, we suggest criteria for selecting patients for surgery based on the postoperative survival pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients who had been operated for metastatic disease of the spine. Predictive scoring was done according to the scoring systems proposed by Tokuhashi and Tomita. Overall survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Using the log rank test and Cox regression model we assessed the value of the individual components of each scoring system for predicting survival in these patients. RESULT The factors that were most significantly associated with survival were the general condition score (Karnofsky Performance Scale) (P=.000, log rank test), metastasis to internal organs (P=.0002 log rank test), and number of extraspinal bone metastases (P=.0058). Type of primary tumor was not found to be significantly associated with survival according to the revised Tokuhashi scoring system (P=.9131, log rank test). Stepwise logistic regression revealed that the Tomita score correlated more closely with survival than the Tokuhashi score. CONCLUSION The patient's performance status, extent of visceral metastasis, and extent of bone metastases are significant predictors of survival in patients with metastatic disease. Both revised Tokuhashi and Tomita scores were significantly correlated with survival. A revised Tokuhashi score of 7 or more and a Tomita score of 6 or less indicated >50% chance of surviving 6 months postoperatively. We recommend that the Tomita score be used for prognostication in patients who are contemplating surgery, as it is simpler to score and has a higher strength of correlation with survival than the Tokuhashi score."

BACKGROUND We sought to identify preoperative factors significantly correlated with survival. We also aimed to evaluate the validity of the prognostic scores in the Tomita and Tokuhashi systems and discuss several aspects to improve the predictive accuracy of these systems. Moreover, we suggest modified criteria for selecting treatment strategies. METHODS In total, the outcomes of 112 patients with spinal metastasis who underwent surgery between January 2006 and June 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The validity of the prognostic scores was assessed on the basis of their correlation with survival. For various primary malignancies, new scoring criteria were applied in each system according to the survival results obtained in this study. Each revised scoring system was adjusted with a similar principle of scoring as described previously. Patient survival according to each preoperative factor was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The predictive value of each scoring system was evaluated by the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS The interval from the diagnosis of the primary malignancy to that of spinal metastasis (p = 0.023) and the interval from the diagnosis of spinal metastasis to surgery (p = 0.039) were significantly correlated with survival. Regarding Tokuhashi scores, the correlation coefficient was 0.790 before adjustment (p = 0.001) and 0.853 after adjustment (p < 0.001). For Tomita scores, the correlation coefficient was -0.994 (p < 0.001) both before and after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS Tomita scores more accurately predicted survival than Tokuhashi scores. It is helpful to evaluate both scoring systems with adjustment for primary malignancy depending on the clinical setting. Patients with Tomita scores less than or equal to 8 and Tokuhashi scores greater than or equal to 6 are recommended to undergo surgical management."

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the predictive value of the Tokuhashi revised scoring system for the life expectancy of patients with spinal metastases. METHODS A retrospective review of 447 patients with spinal metastases was performed, which comprised 291 men and 156 women with a mean age of 56. 1 years. All of the patients were scored with the Tokuhashi revised scoring system based on the available clinical, pathological and radiographic data. The relation between the survival time and the Tokuhashi revised score was analyzed. RESULTS The patients had a median survival time of 7. 9 months and a mean Tokuhashi revised score of 8. 23 points. The median survival time of 155 patients with high grade primary tumor of lung, liver, gastrointestinal tract, esophagus, bladder and pancreas was 4. 7 months. The median survival time of 146 patients with low grade primary tumor of thyroid, breast and prostate was 12 months. The median survival time of 146 patients with medium grade primary tumor of kidney, lymphoma, ovary and uterus, and unknown primary tumor was 7. 1 months. The median survival time of 211 patients with the Tokuhashi revised score of 0 to 8 points was 4 months. The median survival time of 147 patients with the Tokuhashi revised score of 9 to 11 points was 10 months. The median survival time of 89 patients with the Tokuhashi revised score of 12 to 15 points was 29 months. The differences between the groups were significant (P<0. 01 or 0. 0001). The Tokuhashi revised score was positively correlated with survival time (r=0. 833, P<0. 001). CONCLUSION The Tokuhashi revised score could support decision making with reliable estimation of life expectancy of patients with spinal metastases. Surgery could be a better choice to extend life span for those patients with solitary spinal metastasis of slow-growth primary tumor and those with the Tokuhashi revised score of 12 to 15 points."

INTRODUCTION The revised Tokuhashi scoring system has been used to predict survival in patients with metastatic spinal tumors. Because of the rapid progress of cancer therapy, the original criteria of the revised Tokuhashi scoring system became in recent years unsuitable. The study aim was to evaluate the validity of the revised Tokuhashi scoring system in patients who underwent spinal surgery and to establish new prognostic criteria. METHODS The study enrolled 85 patients with metastatic spinal tumors who underwent spinal surgery. The patients' survival outcomes in October 2019 were as follows: 57 patients died; 10 were alive; and 18 had unknown prognoses. The study evaluated the validity of the Tokuhashi scoring system, and established and validated the new prognostic criteria. RESULTS The accuracies of the Tokuhashi scoring system were 66.7% in the short-term group, 60% in the midterm group, and 100% in the long-term group. Among the patients who died, the survival period and total score were significantly correlated. Total score cutoff point was six points in the patients whose predicted survival was <6 months. Total score cutoff point was eight points in the patients whose predicted survival was \u22651 year. CONCLUSIONS As the prognosis of patients has improved in recent years, the original criteria of the revised Tokuhashi scoring system have been questioned as to their suitability to current treatments. Especially, the survival period among the patients with total scores of 7 and 8 points was not accurate. According to this study, the new prognostic criteria of the revised Tokuhashi scoring system were set to 0 to 6 points for the short-term group, 7 points for the midterm group, and 8 to 15 points for the long-term group."

Recent progress in cancer treatment has improved patient survival, but has increased the number of patients with metastatic bone tumors. Data were collected from all bone metastasis patients at Kagoshima University, where almost all patients with metastatic bone tumors who reside in Kagoshima province are treated surgically. The scoring systems used in bone metastasis patients were then evaluated to identify those most suitable for our patients. Clinical data were collected from 145 patients with bone metastases. The patients were assigned prognostic scores based on four scoring systems, namely those described by the Ratasvuori, Mizumoto, Tokuhashi and Katagiri groups. Statistical examinations were performed to assess patient distribution regarding prognostic factors and the four data sets reported in the literature. The patient distributions for all prognostic factors were significantly different between the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (SSG) and Kagoshima data. The distributions of patients for 3 of 5 and for 5 of 7 prognostic factors were statistically different between the Kagoshima data and the Katagiri and Tokuhashi data, respectively. Additionally, the distribution of patients in each scoring group was statistically different between the Kagoshima data and the Katagiri, Tokuhashi and Mizumoto data. The predictions of prognosis were significantly different between the results of each group and ours. The Tokuhashi scoring system detected the highest survival at 6 months (88.8%) in the Kagoshima data. Patients with a life expectancy of >6 months benefited from tumor excision and reconstruction. These findings suggest that the Tokuhashi scoring system is the most suitable for identifying patients who should be assessed for curative surgical intervention. SSG scoring, however, was suitable for identifying patients expected to survive for <6 months (91.3%). Prior to selecting a scoring system to predict prognosis, it is important to determine which scoring system is the most appropriate, based on each hospital's particular characteristics."

BACKGROUND One of the most important selection criteria for spinal metastases surgery is life expectancy and the most important system for this prediction has been proposed by Tokuhashi. The aim of this study was to evaluate predictive value of the Tokuhashi score for life expectancy in Iranian patients with spinal metastases one year after diagnosis. METHODS From February 2007 to March 2009, of 180 patients suffering spinal metastatic tumors, 71 patients were excluded. This left a study population of 109 patients with known malignant metastases to spine (56 females and 53 males; mean age, 57 \u00b1 12 years). Tokuhashi revised evaluation system for the prognosis of metastatic spinal tumors was used for all patients. The survival period predicted by this system for the prognosis and the actual survival period after 1 year follow up were evaluated. RESULTS The predicted survival according to Tokuhashi prognostic scoring system was less than 6 months in 38(34.9%) patients, 6-12 months in 39(35.8%) patients and 1 year or more in 32(29.4%) patients. 39 (35.8%) patients died at first six-month of the follow up, 28(25.7%) patients at the second six-month period and 42(38.5%) patients were alive at the end of the year. There was no significant difference between predicted and actual survival time (p = 0.116). CONCLUSIONS Present study showed that the Tokuhashi revised scoring system may be practicable and highly predictive preoperative scoring system for patients with spinal metastases in Iran."

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE Clinically, whether and how to make a surgical interventional decision for the patients with spinal metastases is still controversial. Life expectancy is a significant determinant in the selection of surgical procedure for spinal metastases. This study was to evaluate Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems in selecting surgical procedure and predicting prognosis of extradural spinal metastases. METHODS A total of 169 patients with spinal metastases, treated in the Spine Unit of Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, from Jan. 2001 to Apr. 2004, were enrolled. The life expectancy was scored according to both Tomita system and Tokuhashi system before operation, the spinal metastases were classified according to Tomita system, and the patients underwent surgery accordingly. Follow-up was done 6, 12, and 24 months after operation. The precise of Tomita system and Tokuhashi system in estimating \"death within 3 months\", \"death within 6 months\", and \"death within 12 months\" was compared using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC curves). The mean survival time of the patients was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS ROC curves of \"death within 3 months\", \"death within 6 months\", and \"death within 12 months\" showed no significant difference between Tomita score and Tokuhashi score in each group (P = 0.16, P = 0.47, and P = 0.38, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that Tomita system overestimated the prognosis in scores from 4 to 7, and Tokuhashi system underestimated the prognosis in scores from 0 to 8. CONCLUSIONS Both Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems could be used to predict prognosis of spinal metastases after operation. Tokuhashi scoring system can predict early death more accurately, which can be used to avoid major operation for these patients."

We assessed how precise the scoring systems predicted survival with McNemar's test. The prognostic value was illustrated with Kaplan-Meier curves, and the individual prognostic components were analyzed with Cox regression analysis. RESULTS The mean age was 65 years (range 20-95), and 57 % of the patients were men. The majority of tumors were lung (23 %), prostate (21 %), and breast tumors (18 %).

Many scoring systems in the literature help estimate prognosis, such as the Tokuhashi, revised Tokuhashi, and Tomita scoring systems. METHODS A retrospective review of all patients from 2003 to 2012 treated for spinal metastases in one center was conducted.

All parameters in the revised Tokuhashi score were significantly associated with survival time except for primary site using univariate analysis. Only the number of spinal metastases and metastasis to major organs showed statistical significance when multiple variable analysis was used.

The Tokuhashi scoring system can be used to predict survival and inform the surgical strategy. We set out to determine the Tokuhashi score for patients with RCC spine metastases and compare expected and observed survival. METHODS Records were reviewed for all patients who underwent surgery for spinal metastases at a single institution from January 2000 to December 2011 to determine the Tokuhashi score and survival. Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank test for univariate analysis were performed with R version 2.15.12 (R Foundation, 2012). RESULTS Thirty patients underwent 40 spinal operations for metastatic RCC. Median survival was 11.4 months. Preoperative Tokuhashi scores were: 12-15, 15 patients; 9-11, seven patients; 0-8, eight patients. Median survival was 32.9, 11.7, and 5.4 months, respectively. Bone (p=0.01) and visceral metastases (p=0.005), and KPS (p=0.002) significantly affected survival.

The ectopic expression of transcription factors for reprogramming human somatic cells to a pluripotent state represents a valuable resource for the development of in vitro-based models for human disease and has great potential in regenerative therapies. However, the majority of studies have used skin fibroblasts to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that typically require the enforced expression of several transcription factors, thereby posing a mutagenesis risk by the insertion of viral transgenes. To reduce this risk, iPSCs have been generated with OCT4 and KLF4 from human neural stem cells that endogenously express the remaining reprogramming factors. However, human neural stem cells are rare and difficult to obtain. Here, we show that iPSCs can be generated from human amniotic fluid cells (hAFCs) with two transcription factors: OCT4 and KLF4. Furthermore, iPSCs can be readily derived from hAFCs in a feeder-free conditions, thereby eliminating the potential variability caused by using feeder cells. Our results indicate that hAFCs represent an accessible source of cells that can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells with two Yamanaka factors. Therefore, hAFCs may become a preferred cell type in the future for safe reprogramming without any exogenous genetic material."

Many studies have provided a number of alternative combinations to the non-Yamanaka factors. However, it is clear that many additional transcription factors that can generate iPSCs remain to be discovered. METHODS The chromatin accessibility and transcriptional level of human embryonic stem cells and human urine cells were compared by Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify potential reprogramming factors. Selected transcription factors were employed to reprogram urine cells, and the reprogramming efficiency was measured. Urine-derived iPSCs were detected for pluripotency by Immunofluorescence, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNA sequencing and teratoma formation test. Finally, we assessed the differentiation potential of the new iPSCs to cardiomyocytes in vitro. RESULTS ATAC-seq and RNA-seq datasets predicted TEAD2, TEAD4 and ZIC3 as potential factors involved in urine cell reprogramming. Transfection of TEAD2, TEAD4 and ZIC3 (in the presence of Yamanaka factors) significantly improved the reprogramming efficiency of urine cells. We confirmed that the newly generated iPSCs possessed pluripotency characteristics similar to normal H1 embryonic stem cells. We also confirmed that the new iPSCs could differentiate to functional cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, TEAD2, TEAD4 and ZIC3 can increase the efficiency of reprogramming human urine cells into iPSCs, and provides a new stem cell sources for the clinical application and modeling of cardiovascular disease."

Mechanistically, c-Jun activates mesenchymal-related genes, broadly suppresses the pluripotent ones, and derails the obligatory mesenchymal to epithelial transition during reprogramming. Furthermore, inhibition of c-Jun by shRNA, dominant-negative c-Jun or Jdp2 enhances reprogramming and replaces Oct4 among the Yamanaka factors. Finally, Jdp2 anchors 5 non-Yamanaka factors (Id1, Jhdm1b, Lrh1, Sall4 and Glis1) to reprogram MEFs into iPSCs. Our studies reveal c-Jun as a guardian of somatic cell fate and its suppression opens the gate to pluripotency."

Its absence leads to increased fork stalling and breakage at over 1,000 specific sites located throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. To understand the mechanisms that respond to and repair rrm3-dependent lesions, we carried out a candidate gene deletion analysis to identify genes whose mutation conferred slow growth or lethality on rrm3 cells. Based on synthetic phenotypes, the intra-S-phase checkpoint, the SRS2 inhibitor of recombination, the SGS1/TOP3 replication fork restart pathway, and the MRE11/RAD50/XRS2 (MRX) complex were critical for viability of rrm3 cells. DNA damage checkpoint and homologous recombination genes were important for normal growth of rrm3 cells. However, the MUS81/MMS4 replication fork restart pathway did not affect growth of rrm3 cells. These data suggest a model in which the stalled and broken forks generated in rrm3 cells activate a checkpoint response that provides time for fork repair and restart. Stalled forks are converted by a Rad51p-mediated process to intermediates that are resolved by Sgs1p/Top3p.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome encodes two Pif1 family members, Rrm3p and Pif1p, that have very different functions. To determine if the amino terminus of Rrm3p contributes to its role in promoting fork progression at >1000 discrete chromosomal sites, we constructed a deletion series that lacked portions of the 249-amino-acid amino terminus. The phenotypes of cells expressing alleles that lacked all or most of the amino terminus were indistinguishable from those of rrm3Delta cells.

Termination of replication forks at the natural termini of the rDNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled in a sequence-specific and polar mode by the interaction of the Fob1p replication terminator protein with the tandem Ter sites located in the nontranscribed spacers. Here we show, by both 2D gel analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP), that there exists a second level of global control mediated by the intra-S-phase checkpoint protein complex of Tof1p and Csm3p that protect stalled forks at Ter sites against the activity of the Rrm3p helicase (\"sweepase\"). The sweepase tends to release arrested forks presumably by the transient displacement of the Ter-bound Fob1p. Consistent with this mechanism, very few replication forks were arrested at the natural replication termini in the absence of the two checkpoint proteins. In the absence of the Rrm3p helicase, there was a slight enhancement of fork arrest at the Ter sites. Simultaneous deletions of the TOF1 (or CSM3), and the RRM3 genes restored fork arrest by removing both the fork-releasing and fork-protection activities. Other genes such as MRC1, WSS1, and PSY2 that are also involved in the MRC1 checkpoint pathway were not involved in this global control. This observation suggests that Tof1p-Csm3p function differently from MRC1 and the other above-mentioned genes. This mechanism is not restricted to the natural Ter sites but was also observed at fork arrest caused by the meeting of a replication fork with transcription approaching from the opposite direction."

To analyze the function of PIF1 homologues in mammals, we cloned the full length human PIF (hPIF) cDNA. Comparison of hPIF with its S. cerevisiae homologues showed that human PIF is equally similar to Pif1p and Rrm3p. Human PIF was expressed at low levels in a variety of tissues and immunofluorescence analysis showed that ectopic hPIF was localized to nuclear foci. hPIF was expressed in late S/G2 phase of the cell cycle and this cell cycle regulated abundance was conferred by both cell cycle regulated mRNA accumulation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Furthermore, hPIF is likely a target of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome as its abundance was decreased when an activator of the APC/C was overexpressed. Finally, antibodies against hPIF immunoprecipitated telomerase activity from human cell lines, and we have observed a physical interaction between hPIF and the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT.

Enveloped viruses commonly utilize late-domain motifs, sometimes cooperatively with ubiquitin, to hijack the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery for budding at the plasma membrane. However, the mechanisms underlying budding of viruses lacking defined late-domain motifs and budding into intracellular compartments are poorly characterized. Here, we map a network of hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein interactions with the ESCRT machinery using a mammalian-cell-based protein interaction screen and reveal nine novel interactions. We identify HRS (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate), an ESCRT-0 complex component, as an important entry point for HCV into the ESCRT pathway and validate its interactions with the HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2 and NS5A in HCV-infected cells. Infectivity assays indicate that HRS is an important factor for efficient HCV assembly. Specifically, by integrating capsid oligomerization assays, biophysical analysis of intracellular viral particles by continuous gradient centrifugations, proteolytic digestion protection, and RNase digestion protection assays, we show that HCV co-opts HRS to mediate a late assembly step, namely, envelopment. In the absence of defined late-domain motifs, K63-linked polyubiquitinated lysine residues in the HCV NS2 protein bind the HRS ubiquitin-interacting motif to facilitate assembly. Finally, ESCRT-III and VPS/VTA1 components are also recruited by HCV proteins to mediate assembly. These data uncover involvement of ESCRT proteins in intracellular budding of a virus lacking defined late-domain motifs and a novel mechanism by which HCV gains entry into the ESCRT network, with potential implications for other viruses. IMPORTANCE Viruses commonly bud at the plasma membrane by recruiting the host ESCRT machinery via conserved motifs termed late domains. The mechanism by which some viruses, such as HCV, bud intracellularly is, however, poorly characterized. Moreover, whether envelopment of HCV and other viruses lacking defined late domains is ESCRT mediated and, if so, what the entry points into the ESCRT pathway are remain unknown. Here, we report the interaction network of HCV with the ESCRT machinery and a critical role for HRS, an ESCRT-0 complex component, in HCV envelopment. Viral protein ubiquitination was discovered to be a signal for HRS binding and HCV assembly, thereby functionally compensating for the absence of late domains. These findings characterize how a virus lacking defined late domains co-opts ESCRT to bud intracellularly. Since the ESCRT machinery is essential for the life cycle of multiple viruses, better understanding of this virus-host interplay may yield targets for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies."

Our previous results showed that ESCRT-0 is essential for fungal development and pathogenicity in Fusarium graminearum. We then, in this study, systemically studied the protein-protein interactions within F. graminearum ESCRT-I, -II or -III complex, as well as between ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I, ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II, and ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III complexes and found that loss of any ESCRT component resulted in abnormal function in endocytosis. In addition, ESCRT deletion mutants displayed severe defects in growth, deoxynivalenol (DON) production, virulence, sexual, and asexual reproduction. Importantly genetic complementation with corresponding ESCRT genes fully rescued all these defective phenotypes, indicating the essential role of ESCRT machinery in fungal development and plant infection in F. graminearum. Taken together, the protein-protein interactome and biological functions of the ESCRT machinery is first profoundly characterized in F. graminearum, providing a foundation for further exploration of ESCRT machinery in filamentous fungi."

However, our understanding of how the host ESCRT machinery responds to viral infection remains limited. Emerging evidence suggests that the ESCRT machinery can be hijacked by viruses of different families to enhance their replication. Throughout their life cycle, these viruses can interfere with or exploit ESCRT-mediated physiological processes to increase their chances of infecting the host. In contrast, to counteract virus infection, the interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) or the E3 ISG15-protein ligase (HERC5) system within the infected cells is activated to degrade the ESCRT proteins. Many retroviral and RNA viral proteins have evolved \"late (L) domain\" motifs, which enable them to recruit host ESCRT subunit proteins to facilitate virus transport, replication, budding, mature, and even endocytosis, Therefore, the L domain motifs and ESCRT subunit proteins could serve as promising drug targets for antiviral therapy. This review investigated the composition and essential functions of the ESCRT, shedding light on the impact of ESCRT subunits and viral L domain motifs on the replication of viruses. Furthermore, the antiviral effects facilitated by the ESCRT machinery have been investigated, aiming to provide valuable insights to guide the development and utilization of antiviral drugs."

Microtubules have important functions ranging from maintenance of cell morphology to subcellular transport, cellular signaling, cell migration, and formation of cell polarity. At the organismal level, microtubules are crucial for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity, learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of \u03b1-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity. Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and function."

Microtubules (MTs) support a variety of neuronal functions, such as maintenance of cell structure, transport, and synaptic plasticity. Neuronal MTs are highly heterogeneous due to several tubulin isotypes and the presence of multiple post-translational modifications, such as detyrosination and acetylation. The tubulin tyrosination/detyrosination cycle is a key player in the maintenance of MT dynamics, as tyrosinated tubulin is associated with more dynamic MTs, while detyrosinated tubulin is linked to longer lived, more stable MTs. Dysfunction of tubulin re-tyrosination was recently correlated to Alzheimer's disease progression. The implication of tubulin acetylation in Alzheimer's disease has, however, remained controversial. Here, we demonstrate that tubulin acetylation accumulates in post-mortem brain tissues from Alzheimer's disease patients and human neurons harboring the Alzheimer's familial APP-V717I mutation. We further show that tubulin re-tyrosination, which is defective in Alzheimer's disease, can control acetylated tubulin in primary neurons irrespective of the levels of the enzymes regulating tubulin acetylation, suggesting that reduced MT dynamics associated with impaired tubulin re-tyrosination might contribute to the accumulation of tubulin acetylation that we detected in Alzheimer's disease."

Cytoskeletal proteins and post-translational modifications play a role in mood disorders. Post-translational modifications of tubulin also alter microtubule dynamics. Furthermore, tubulin interacts closely with G\u03b1s, the G-protein responsible for activation of adenylyl cyclase. Postmortem tissue derived from depressed suicide brain showed increased G\u03b1s in lipid-raft domains compared with normal subjects. G\u03b1s, when ensconced in lipid rafts, couples less effectively with adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP, and this is reversed by antidepressant treatment. A recent in vitro study demonstrated that tubulin anchors G\u03b1s to lipid rafts and that increased tubulin acetylation (due to HDAC6 inhibition) and antidepressant treatment decreased the proportion of G\u03b1s complexed with tubulin. This suggested that deacetylated-tubulin might be more prevalent in depression. This study examined tubulin acetylation in whole-tissue homogenate, plasma membrane, and lipid-raft membrane domains in tissue from normal control subjects, depressed suicides, and depressed nonsuicides (human males/females). While tissue homogenate showed no changes in tubulin acetylation between control, depressed suicides, and depressed nonsuicides, plasma membrane-associated tubulin showed significant decreases in acetylation from depressed suicides and depressed nonsuicides compared with controls. No change was seen in expression of the enzymes responsible for tubulin acetylation or deacetylation. These data suggest that, during depression, membrane-localized tubulin maintains a lower acetylation state, permitting increased sequestration of G\u03b1s in lipid-raft domains, where it is less likely to couple to adenylyl cyclase for cAMP production. Thus, membrane tubulin may play a role in mood disorders, which could be exploited for diagnosis and treatment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT There is little understanding about the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of depression and, in severe cases, suicide. Evidence for the role of microtubule modifications in progression of depressive disorders is emerging. These postmortem data provide strong evidence for membrane tubulin modification leading to reduced efficacy of the G protein, G\u03b1s, in depression. This study reveals a direct link between decreased tubulin acetylation in human depression and the increased localization of G\u03b1s in lipid-raft domains responsible for attenuated cAMP signaling. The evidence presented here suggest a novel diagnostic and therapeutic locus for depression."

MTs functional diversity depends on the differential expression of distinct tubulin isotypes and is amplified by a vast number of different post-translational modifications (PTMs). The addition/removal of PTMs to \u03b1- or \u03b2-tubulins is catalyzed by specific enzymes and allows combinatory patterns largely enriching the distinct biochemical and biophysical properties of MTs, creating a code read by distinct proteins, including microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which allow cellular responses.

A tight association between Chlamydomonas alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase (TAT) and flagellar axonemes, and the cytoplasmic localization of both tubulin deacetylase (TDA) and an inhibitor of tubulin acetylation have been demonstrated by the use of calf brain tubulin as substrate for these enzymes. A major axonemal TAT of 130 kD has been solubilized by high salt treatment, purified, and characterized. Using the Chlamydomonas TAT with brain tubulin as substrate, we have studied the effects of acetylation on the assembly and disassembly of microtubules in vitro. We also determined the relative rates of acetylation of tubulin dimers and polymers. The acetylation does not significantly affect the temperature-dependent polymerization or depolymerization of tubulin in vitro. Furthermore, polymerization of tubulin is not a prerequisite for the acetylation, although the polymer is a better substrate for TAT than the dimer. The acetylation is sensitive to calcium ions which completely inhibit the acetylation of both dimers and polymers of tubulin. Acetylation of the dimer is not inhibited by colchicine; the effect of colchicine on acetylation of the polymer can be explained by its depolymerizing effect on the polymer."

Cilia are evolutionarily highly conserved organelles with important functions in many organs. The extracellular component of the cilium protruding from the plasma membrane comprises an axoneme composed of microtubule doublets, arranged in a 9 + 0 conformation in primary cilia or 9 + 2 in motile cilia. These microtubules facilitate transport of intraflagellar cargoes along the axoneme. They also provide structural stability to the cilium, which may play an important role in sensory cilia, where signals are received from the movement of extracellular fluid. Post-translational modification of microtubules in cilia is a well-studied phenomenon, and acetylation on lysine 40 (K40) of alpha tubulin is prominent in cilia. It is believed that this modification contributes to the stabilization of cilia. Two classes of enzymes, histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases, mediate regulation of tubulin acetylation. Here we use a genetic approach, immunocytochemistry and behavioral tests to investigate the function of tubulin deacetylases in cilia in a zebrafish model. By mutating three histone deacetylase genes (Sirt2, Hdac6, and Hdac10), we identify an unforeseen role for Hdac6 and Sirt2 in cilia. As expected, mutation of these genes leads to increased acetylation of cytoplasmic tubulin, however, surprisingly it caused decreased tubulin acetylation in cilia in the developing eye, ear, brain and kidney. Cilia in the ear and eye showed elevated levels of mono-glycylated tubulin suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These changes did not affect the length or morphology of cilia, however, functional defects in balance was observed, suggesting that the level of tubulin acetylation may affect function of the cilium."

This review describes the enzymes responsible for the post-translational modifications of tubulin, including detyrosination/tyrosination, acetylation/deacetylation, phosphorylation, polyglutamylation, polyglycylation and the generation of non-tyrosinatable alpha-tubulin. Tubulin tyrosine-ligase, which reattaches tyrosine to detyrosinated tubulin, has been extensively characterized and its gene sequenced. Enzymes such as tubulin-specific carboxypeptidase and alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase, required, respectively, for detyrosination and acetylation of tubulin, have yet to be purified to homogeneity and examined in defined systems. This has produced some conflicting results, especially for the carboxypeptidase. The phosphorylation of tubulin by several different types of kinases has been studied in detail but drawing conclusions is difficult because many of these enzymes modify proteins other than their actual substrates, an especially pertinent consideration for in vitro experiments. Tubulin phosphorylation in cultured neuronal cells has proven to be the best model for evaluation of kinase effects on tubulin/microtubule function. There is little information on the enzymes required for polyglutamylation, polyglycylation, and production of non-tyrosinatable tubulin, but the available data permit interesting speculation of a mechanistic nature. Clearly, to achieve a full appreciation of tubulin post-translational changes the responsible enzymes must be characterized. Knowing when the enzymes are active in cells, if soluble or polymerized tubulin is the preferred substrate and the amino acid residues modified by each enzyme are all important. Moreover, acquisition of purified enzymes will lead to cloning and sequencing of their genes. With this information, one can manipulate cell genomes in order to either modify key enzymes or change their relative amounts, and perhaps reveal the physiological significance of tubulin post-translational modifications."

Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is dependent on \u03b1-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant \u03b1-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with enhanced activity on acetylated \u03b1-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of \u03b1-tubulin acetylation initiates cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting \u03b1-tubulin severing by katanin which, in turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological transition toward mature adipocytes."

However, the relationship between G-quadruplexes and higher-order genome organization remains unknown. Here, we found that G-quadruplexes are significantly enriched at boundaries of topological associated domains (TADs). Architectural protein occupancy, which plays critical roles in the formation of TADs, was highly correlated with the content of G-quadruplexes at TAD boundaries. Moreover, adjacent boundaries containing G-quadruplexes frequently interacted with each other because of the high enrichment of architectural protein binding sites. Similar to CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites, G-quadruplexes also showed strong insulation ability in the separation of adjacent regions. Additionally, the insulation ability of CTCF binding sites and TAD boundaries was significantly reinforced by G-quadruplexes. Furthermore, G-quadruplex motifs on different strands were associated with the orientation of CTCF binding sites. These findings suggest a potential role for G-quadruplexes in loop extrusion. The enrichment of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) around regulatory elements containing G-quadruplexes led to frequent interactions between regulatory elements containing G-quadruplexes. Intriguingly, more than 99% of G-quadruplexes overlapped with TFBSs. The binding sites of CTCF and cohesin proteins were preferentially located surrounding G-quadruplexes.

Recent studies have reported deviation from this general convention. One such deviation is the involvement of bulges in the guanine tracts.

Importantly, the positioning and number of GNG/GNGNG can also influence the formation of G-quadruplexes. Further, we assessed three genomic regions from HIF1 alpha, VEGF and SHOX gene for G-quadruplex formation using GNG motifs. We show that HIF1 alpha sequence harbouring GNG motifs can fold into intramolecular G-quadruplex. In contrast, GNG motifs in mutant VEGF sequence could not participate in structure formation, suggesting that the usage of GNG is context dependent.

DMS footprinting can also reveal important information in G-quadruplex-protein complexes on protein contacts and regional changes in DNA G-quadruplex upon protein binding. In this paper, we will provide a detailed protocol for the EMSA and DMS footprinting assays for characterization of G-quadruplexes and G-quadruplex-protein complexes. Expected outcomes and references to extensions of the method will be further discussed."

RATIONALE Although the microRNAs miR-23b, miR-27b and miR-24 are located in the same cluster, their expressions in various pathological states are not always comparable. By searching the genomic sequence around mir23b-27b-24-1 in rat, we identified three potential G-quadruplex sequences (PQS) which can fold into different types of G-quadruplexes, including parallel or antiparallel. Natural alkaloids, tetrandrine (TET), displayed different binding affinity with the three G-quadruplexes which may potentially regulate the expression of mir23b-27b-24-1 cluster members. METHODS Both electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy were utilized to detect the formation of G-quadruplexes. Six small molecules were screened by ESI-MS for their binding affinity with three G-quadruplexes, which were evaluated by their IRa values. RESULTS The results of ESI-MS and CD experiments confirmed the formation of three G-quadruplexes neighboring the mir23b-27b-24-1 cluster; two of them adopted antiparallel G-quadruplexes, another adopted a parallel G-quadruplex. Screening of small molecules by ESI-MS showed tetrandrine had selective binding affinity for the parallel G-quadruplex. G-quadruplex stabilization by tetrandrine was verified by CD variable temperature measurements. CONCLUSIONS The gene of the mir23b-27b-24-1 cluster harbors three G-quadruplexes with typical sequences and structures. Tetrandrine had a selective binding affinity to the parallel G-quadruplex and stabilized it significantly. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Several efforts have been devoted to the development of ligands targeting telomeric multimeric G-quadruplexes in recent years.

However, RNA G-quadruplexes have not yet been reported in cells. Here, we demonstrate the visualization of RNA G-quadruplex structures within the cytoplasm of human cells using a G-quadruplex structure-specific antibody.

Furthermore, a small molecule that exhibits a preference for RNA G-quadruplexes rather than DNA G-quadruplexes in biophysical experiments also shows the same selectivity within a cellular context. Our findings provide substantive evidence for RNA G-quadruplex formation in the human transcriptome, and corroborate the selectivity and application of stabilizing ligands that target G-quadruplexes within a cellular context."

The omega-conotoxins are a set of structurally related, four-loop, six cysteine containing peptides, that have a range of selectivities for different subtypes of the voltage-sensitive calcium channel (VSCC). To investigate the basis of the selectivity displayed by these peptides, we have studied the binding affinities of two naturally occurring omega-conotoxins, MVIIA and MVIIC and a series of 14 MVIIA/MVIIC loop hybrids using radioligand binding assays for N and P/Q-type Ca2+channels in rat brain tissue. A selectivity profile was developed from the ratio of relative potencies at N-type VSCCs (using [125I]GVIA radioligand binding assays) and P/Q-type VSCCs (using [125I]MVIIC radioligand binding assays). In these peptides, loops 2 and 4 make the greatest contribution to VSCC subtype selectivity, while the effects of loops 1 and 3 are negligible. Peptides with homogenous combinations of loop 2 and 4 display clear selectivity preferences, while those with heterogeneous combinations of loops 2 and 4 are less discriminatory. 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that the global folds of MVIIA, MVIIC and the 14 loop hybrid peptides were similar; however, several differences in local structure were identified. Based on the binding data and the 3D structures of MVIIA, GVIA and MVIIC, we have developed a preliminary pharmacophore based on the omega-conotoxin residues most likely to interact with the N-type VSCC."

High-threshold voltage-sensitive calcium channels of the N-type, L-type, and P-type have been distinguished in the mammalian CNS predominantly on the basis of their sensitivity to selective antagonists. Matching them with genes identified by molecular cloning is an ongoing undertaking. Whereas L-type channels are characterized by their sensitivity to dihydropyridines and P-type channels by sensitivity to the funnel-web spider toxin AgaIVA, the N-type channel has been shown to be recognized by the omega-conopeptides GVIA and MVIIA. Recently, two new members of the family of omega-conopeptides--MVIIC from the marine snail Conus magus and SVIB from Conus striatus--have been described. Binding and electrophysiological data suggest that these two peptides, in addition to interacting with N-type calcium channels, interact with a widely distributed receptor in neuronal membranes that is distinct from N-type channels. In this report we demonstrate through biochemical and pharmacological differentiation at individual receptor polypeptide resolution, by affinity cross-linking, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography, that SNX-230 (synthetic MVIIC) binds with high affinity to a calcium channel alpha 1 subunit distinct from the high-affinity alpha 1 target of SNX-111 (synthetic MVIIA). SNX-183 (synthetic SVIB) interacts with both alpha 1 subunits with lower affinity.

A comparison of the Halpha secondary shifts suggests that the structural scaffolds of MVIIA and MVIIC are little altered by the L- to D- inversion of Tyr13; however, the conformations of several residues in loop 2 (residues 9-14) are significantly altered. The experimentally determined 3D structure of [D-Y13]MVIIA indicates that the positions of key residues in this loop which are involved in the binding of MVIIA to the N-type VSCC (Tyr13, Arg10, and Leu11) are so changed as to render the peptide unrecognizable by its cognate ion channel.

A number of peptide toxins from venoms of spiders and cone snails are high affinity ligands for voltage-gated calcium channels and are useful tools for studying calcium channel function and structure. Using whole-cell recordings from rat sympathetic ganglion and cerebellar Purkinje neurons, we studied toxins that target neuronal N-type (Ca(V)2.2) and P-type (Ca(V)2.1) calcium channels. We asked whether different toxins targeting the same channels bind to the same or different sites on the channel. Five toxins (omega-conotoxin-GVIA, omega-conotoxin MVIIC, omega-agatoxin-IIIA, omega-grammotoxin-SIA, and omega-agatoxin-IVA) were applied in pairwise combinations to either N- or P-type channels. Differences in the characteristics of inhibition, including voltage dependence, reversal kinetics, and fractional inhibition of current, were used to detect additive or mutually occlusive effects of toxins. Results suggest at least two distinct toxin binding sites on the N-type channel and three on the P-type channel. On N-type channels, results are consistent with blockade of the channel pore by omega-CgTx-GVIA, omega-Aga-IIIA, and omega-CTx-MVIIC, whereas grammotoxin likely binds to a separate region coupled to channel gating. omega-Aga-IIIA produces partial channel block by decreasing single-channel conductance. On P-type channels, omega-CTx-MVIIC and omega-Aga-IIIA both likely bind near the mouth of the pore. omega-Aga-IVA and grammotoxin each bind to distinct regions associated with channel gating that do not overlap with the binding region of pore blockers. For both N- and P-type channels, omega-CTx-MVIIC binding produces complete channel block, but is prevented by previous partial channel block by omega-Aga-IIIA, suggesting that omega-CTx-MVIIC binds closer to the external mouth of the pore than does omega-Aga-IIIA."

The relative activities of the conotoxins showed some difference between the two preparations in that for ileum it was MVIIA = GVIA > MVIIC = SVIB and for the vas deferens it was MVIIA > GVIA >> SVIB > MVIIC. High frequency electrical stimulation of both preparations resulted in a neurally-mediated omega-conotoxin GVIA resistant component that was sensitive to high concentrations of either omega-conotoxin MVIIC (300 nM- 1 microM) or omega-agatoxin IVA (300 nM-1 microM) but not to omega-conotoxin MVIIA.

PhTx3-4, but not \u03c9-conotoxin MVIIA or xconotoxin MVIIC, is able to inhibit the uptake of glutamate by synaptosomes, and this inhibition in turn leads to a decrease in the Ca(2+)-independent release of glutamate. No other polypeptide toxin so far described has this effect. PhTx3-4 and \u03c9-conotoxins MVIIC and MVIIA are blockers of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and they significantly inhibited the capsaicin-induced rise of intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)](i) in spinal cord synaptosomes, which likely reflects calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels.

Few effective therapies exist for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases that have been characterized as protein misfolding disorders. Upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) mitigates against the accumulation of misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins and synaptic dysfunction, which is recognized as an early event in neurodegenerative diseases. Enhanced induction of a set of Hsps in differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells was observed following co-application of celastrol and arimoclomol, compared to their individual application. The dosages employed did not affect cell viability or neuronal process morphology. The induced Hsps included the little studied HSPA6 (Hsp70B'), a potentially neuroprotective protein that is present in the human genome but not in rat and mouse and hence is missing in current animal models of neurodegenerative disease. Enhanced induction of HSPA1A (Hsp70-1), DNAJB1 (Hsp40), HO-1 (Hsp32), and HSPB1 (Hsp27) was also observed. Celastrol activates heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), the master regulator of Hsp gene transcription, and also exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Arimoclomol is a co-activator that prolongs the binding of activated HSF1 to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoter regions of inducible Hsp genes. Elevated Hsp levels peaked at 10 to 12 h for HSPA6, HSPA1A, DNAJB1, and HO-1 and at 24 h for HSPB1. Co-application of celastrol and arimoclomol induced higher Hsp levels compared to heat shock paired with arimoclomol. The co-application strategy of celastrol and arimoclomol targets multiple neurodegenerative disease-associated pathologies including protein misfolding and protein aggregation, inflammatory and oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction."

Upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) is an approach to treatment of neurodegenerative disorders with impaired proteostasis. Many neurons, including motor neurons affected in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are relatively resistant to stress-induced upregulation of HSPs. This study demonstrated that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors enable the heat shock response in cultured spinal motor neurons, in a stress-dependent manner, and can improve the efficacy of HSP-inducing drugs in murine spinal cord cultures subjected to thermal or proteotoxic stress. The effect of particular HDAC inhibitors differed with the stress paradigm. The HDAC6 (class IIb) inhibitor, tubastatin A, acted as a co-inducer of Hsp70 (HSPA1A) expression with heat shock, but not with proteotoxic stress induced by expression of mutant SOD1 linked to familial ALS. Certain HDAC class I inhibitors (the pan inhibitor, SAHA, or the HDAC1/3 inhibitor, RGFP109) were HSP co-inducers comparable to the hydroxyamine arimoclomol in response to proteotoxic stress, but not thermal stress. Regardless, stress-induced Hsp70 expression could be enhanced by combining an HDAC inhibitor with either arimoclomol or with an HSP90 inhibitor that constitutively induced HSPs. HDAC inhibition failed to induce Hsp70 in motor neurons expressing ALS-linked mutant FUS, in which the heat shock response was suppressed; yet SAHA, RGFP109, and arimoclomol did reduce loss of nuclear FUS, a disease hallmark, and HDAC inhibition rescued the DNA repair response in iPSC-derived motor neurons carrying the FUSP525Lmutation, pointing to multiple mechanisms of neuroprotection by both HDAC inhibiting drugs and arimoclomol."

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited diseases that cause blindness due to the progressive death of rod and cone photoreceptors in the retina. There are currently no effective treatments for RP. Inherited mutations in rhodopsin, the light-sensing protein of rod photoreceptor cells, are the most common cause of autosomal-dominant RP. The majority of mutations in rhodopsin, including the common P23H substitution, lead to protein misfolding, which is a feature in many neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies have shown that upregulating molecular chaperone expression can delay disease progression in models of neurodegeneration. Here, we have explored the potential of the heat-shock protein co-inducer arimoclomol to ameliorate rhodopsin RP. In a cell model of P23H rod opsin RP, arimoclomol reduced P23H rod opsin aggregation and improved viability of mutant rhodopsin-expressing cells. In P23H rhodopsin transgenic rat models, pharmacological potentiation of the stress response with arimoclomol improved electroretinogram responses and prolonged photoreceptor survival, as assessed by measuring outer nuclear layer thickness in the retina. Furthermore, treated animal retinae showed improved photoreceptor outer segment structure and reduced rhodopsin aggregation compared with vehicle-treated controls. The heat-shock response (HSR) was activated in P23H retinae, and this was enhanced with arimoclomol treatment. Furthermore, the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is induced in P23H transgenic rats, was also enhanced in the retinae of arimoclomol-treated animals, suggesting that arimoclomol can potentiate the UPR as well as the HSR. These data suggest that pharmacological enhancement of cellular stress responses may be a potential treatment for rhodopsin RP and that arimoclomol could benefit diseases where ER stress is a factor."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motoneuron degeneration, resulting in muscle paralysis and death, typically within 1-5 years of diagnosis. Although the pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear, there is evidence for the involvement of proteasome dysfunction and heat shock proteins in the disease. We have previously shown that treatment with a co-inducer of the heat shock response called arimoclomol is effective in the SOD(G93A) mouse model of ALS, delaying disease progression and extending the lifespan of SOD(G93A) mice (Kieran et al. 2004). However, this previous study only examined the effects arimoclomol when treatment was initiated in pre- or early symptomatic stages of the disease. Clearly, to be of benefit to the majority of ALS patients, any therapy must be effective after symptom onset. In order to establish whether post-symptomatic treatment with arimoclomol is effective, in this study we carried out a systematic assessment of different treatment regimes in SOD(G93A) mice. Treatment with arimoclomol from early (75 days) or late (90 days) symptomatic stages significantly improved muscle function. Treatment from 75 days also significantly increased the lifespan of SOD(G93A) mice, although treatment from 90 days has no significant effect on lifespan. The mechanism of action of arimoclomol involves potentiation of the heat shock response, and treatment with arimoclomol increased Hsp70 expression. Interestingly, this up-regulation in Hsp70 was accompanied by a decrease in the number of ubiquitin-positive aggregates in the spinal cord of treated SOD(G93A) mice, suggesting that arimoclomol directly effects protein aggregation and degradation."

Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, also known as Kennedy's disease, is an adult-onset hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine repeat in the first exon in the androgen receptor gene. Pathologically, the disease is defined by selective loss of spinal and bulbar motor neurons causing bulbar, facial and limb weakness. Although the precise disease pathophysiology is largely unknown, it appears to be related to abnormal accumulation of the pathogenic androgen receptor protein within the nucleus, leading to disruption of cellular processes. Using a mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy that exhibits many of the characteristic features of the human disease, in vivo physiological assessment of muscle function revealed that mice with the pathogenic expansion of the androgen receptor develop a motor deficit characterized by a reduction in muscle force, abnormal muscle contractile characteristics, loss of functional motor units and motor neuron degeneration. We have previously shown that treatment with arimoclomol, a co-inducer of the heat shock stress response, delays disease progression in the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a fatal motor neuron disease. We therefore evaluated the therapeutic potential of arimoclomol in mice with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Arimoclomol was administered orally, in drinking water, from symptom onset and the effects established at 18 months of age, a late stage of disease. Arimoclomol significantly improved hindlimb muscle force and contractile characteristics, rescued motor units and, importantly, improved motor neuron survival and upregulated the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor which possess neurotrophic activity. These results provide evidence that upregulation of the heat shock response by treatment with arimoclomol may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and may also be a possible approach for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases."

Arimoclomol is a hydroxylamine derivative, a group of compounds which have unique properties as co-inducers of heat shock protein expression, but only under conditions of cellular stress. Arimoclomol has been found to be neuroprotective in a number of neurodegenerative disease models, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and in mutant Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) mice that model ALS, Arimoclomol rescues motor neurons, improves neuromuscular function and extends lifespan. The therapeutic potential of Arimoclomol is currently under investigation in a Phase II clinical trial for ALS patients with SOD1 mutations. In this review we summarize the evidence for the neuroprotective effects of enhanced heat shock protein expression by Arimoclomol and other inducers of the Heat Shock Response. ALS is a complex, multifactorial disease affecting a number of cell types and intracellular pathways. Cells and pathways affected by ALS pathology and which may be targeted by a heat shock protein-based therapy are also discussed in this review. For example, protein aggregation is a characteristic pathological feature of neurodegenerative diseases including ALS. Enhanced heat shock protein expression not only affects protein aggregation directly, but can also lead to more effective clearance of protein aggregates via the unfolded protein response, the proteasome-ubiquitin system or by autophagy. However, compounds such as Arimoclomol have effects beyond targeting protein mis-handling and can also affect additional pathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress. Therefore, by targeting multiple pathological mechanisms, compounds such as Arimoclomol may be particularly effective in the development of a disease-modifying therapy for ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders."

BACKGROUND Inclusion body myositis is the most common progressive muscle wasting disease in people older than 50 years, with no effective drug treatment. Arimoclomol is an oral co-inducer of the cellular heat shock response that was safe and well-tolerated in a pilot study of inclusion body myositis, reduced key pathological markers of inclusion body myositis in two in-vitro models representing degenerative and inflammatory components of this disease, and improved disease pathology and muscle function in mutant valosin-containing protein mice. In the current study, we aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of arimoclomol in people with inclusion body myositis. METHODS This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled adults in specialist neuromuscular centres in the USA (11 centres) and UK (one centre). Eligible participants had a diagnosis of inclusion body myositis fulfilling the European Neuromuscular Centre research diagnostic criteria 2011. Participants were randomised (1:1) to receive either oral arimoclomol 400 mg or matching placebo three times daily (1200 mg/day) for 20 months. The randomisation sequence was computer generated centrally using a permuted block algorithm with randomisation numbers masked to participants and trial staff, including those assessing outcomes. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to month 20 in the Inclusion Body Myositis Functional Rating Scale (IBMFRS) total score, assessed in all randomly assigned participants, except for those who were randomised in error and did not receive any study medication, and those who did not meet inclusion criteria. Safety analyses included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02753530, and is completed. FINDINGS Between Aug 16, 2017 and May 22, 2019, 152 participants with inclusion body myositis were randomly assigned to arimoclomol (n=74) or placebo (n=78). One participant was randomised in error (to arimoclomol) but not treated, and another (assigned to placebo) did not meet inclusion criteria. 150 participants (114 [76%] male and 36 [24%] female) were included in the efficacy analyses, 73 in the arimoclomol group and 77 in the placebo group. 126 completed the trial on treatment (56 [77%] and 70 [90%], respectively) and the most common reason for treatment discontinuation was adverse events. At month 20, mean IBMFRS change from baseline was not statistically significantly different between arimoclomol and placebo (-3\u00b726, 95% CI -4\u00b715 to -2\u00b736 in the arimoclomol group vs -2\u00b726, -3\u00b711 to -1\u00b741 in the placebo group; mean difference -0\u00b799 [95% CI -2\u00b723 to 0\u00b724]; p=0\u00b712). Adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in 13 (18%) of 73 participants in the arimoclomol group and four (5%) of 78 participants in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in 11 (15%) participants in the arimoclomol group and 18 (23%) in the placebo group. Elevated transaminases three times or more of the upper limit of normal occurred in five (7%) participants in the arimoclomol group and one (1%) in the placebo group. Tubulointerstitial nephritis was observed in one (1%) participant in the arimoclomol group and none in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION Arimoclomol did not improve efficacy outcomes, relative to placebo, but had an acceptable safety profile in individuals with inclusion body myositis. This is one of the largest trials done in people with inclusion body myositis, providing data on disease progression that might be used for subsequent clinical trial design.

The novel hydroxylamine derivative, bimoclomol, has been shown previously to act as a co-inducer of several heat shock proteins (Hsp-s), enhancing the amount of these proteins produced following a heat shock compared to heat shock alone. Here we show that the co-inducing effect of bimoclomol on Hsp expression is mediated via the prolonged activation of the heat shock transcription factor (HSF-1). Bimoclomol effects are abolished in cells from mice lacking HSF-1. Moreover, bimoclomol binds to HSF-1 and induces a prolonged binding of HSF-1 to the respective DNA elements. Since HSF-1 does not bind to DNA in the absence of stress, the bimoclomol-induced extension of HSF-1/DNA interaction may contribute to the chaperone co-induction of bimoclomol observed previously. These findings indicate that bimoclomol may be of value in targeting HSF-1 so as to induce up-regulation of protective Hsp-s in a non-stressful manner and for therapeutic benefit."

SETTING Four US communities. PARTICIPANTS A total of 9114 and 9108 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study for analyses of hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP, respectively. MEASUREMENTS We examined association of hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP with 15-year change (1996-1998 to 2011-2013) in three cognitive tests of executive function (Digit Symbol Substitution Test), verbal learning memory (Delayed Word Recall Test), and semantic fluency (Word Fluency Test), and an overall score combining the three tests using multivariable linear mixed effect models. We conducted several sensitivity analyses including multiple imputations to address bias due to missing data and attrition, and we compared associations within groups combining hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP into a three-level categorical variable. RESULTS At baseline (1996-1998), mean age was 63.4 (standard deviation [SD] = 5.7) years; 56.4% were women, and 17.5% were black. The hs-cTnT at baseline was not associated with cognitive change in any measure. Some evidence indicated accelerated decline in verbal learning and memory when comparing those in the highest with the lowest NT-proBNP quintiles; however, this association was not replicated when considering clinically relevant cutoffs or deciles of exposure in survivors. Sensitivity analyses were consistent with our primary analyses. There was little evidence to support effect modification by any considered factors. People with highest levels of both biomarkers had excessive decline in global z scores vs people with lowest levels (-.34; 95% confidence interval = -.63 to -.04). CONCLUSION Markers of myocardial injury and stretch were not associated with cognitive decline following 15 years among survivors, but when combined together they were suggestive in post hoc analysis.

OBJECTIVE To study the relation between N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, used as a marker of heart failure in clinical practice, blood pressure (BP), and cognitive decline in the oldest old. METHODS In 560 participants of the Leiden 85-plus Study, we measured NT-proBNP levels and BP at age 85 years, at baseline, and global cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) annually during the follow-up of 5 years. RESULTS Subjects in the highest tertile of NT-proBNP levels scored 1.7 points lower on the MMSE at age 85 years than subjects in the lowest tertile (p = 0.004), and had a 0.24-point-steeper decline in MMSE score per year (p = 0.021). The longitudinal association disappeared after full adjustment for possible confounders (0.14-point-steeper decline, p = 0.187). Subjects in the category \"highest tertile of NT-proBNP and the lowest tertile of systolic BP\" had a 3.7-point-lower MMSE score at baseline (p < 0.001) and a 0.49-point-steeper decline in MMSE score per year (p < 0.001) compared with subjects in the other categories. CONCLUSIONS In the oldest old, high NT-proBNP levels are associated with lower MMSE scores. The combination of high NT-proBNP levels and low systolic BP is associated with worst global cognitive function and the steepest cognitive decline. Possibly, a failing pump function of the heart results in lower BP and lower brain perfusion with resultant brain dysfunction."

OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and changes in cognition and global brain structure. METHODS In the Rotterdam Study, baseline NT-proBNP was assessed at baseline from 1997 to 2008. Between 1997 and 2016, participants without dementia or stroke at baseline (n = 9566) had repeated cognitive tests (every 3-6 years) for global cognitive function, executive cognitive function, fine manual dexterity, and memory. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed repeatedly at re-examination visits between 2005 and 2015 for 2607 participants to obtain brain volumes, focal brain lesions, and white matter microstructural integrity as measures of brain structure. RESULTS Among 9566 participants (mean age 65.1 \u00b1 9.8 years), 5444 (56.9%) were women, and repeated measures of cognition were performed during a median follow-up time of 5.5 (range 1.1-17.9) years, of whom 2607 participants completed at least one brain imaging scan. Higher levels of NT-proBNP were associated with a faster decline of scores in the global cognitive function (p value = 0.003) and the Word-Fluency test (p value = 0.003) but were not related to a steeper deterioration in brain volumes, global fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity, as indicators of white matter microstructural integrity, or focal brain lesions. CONCLUSIONS Higher baseline NT-proBNP levels were associated with a faster decline in cognition; however, no association with global brain structure was found."

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of NT-proBNP with cognitive function and decline in older adults at high risk of cardiovascular disease. METHODS We studied 5,205 men and women (mean age = 75 years) who were recruited into the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk. All participants had pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors thereof. Four domains of cognitive function were tested at baseline and repeated during a follow-up period of 3.2 years. RESULTS Participants with higher NT-proBNP (\u2265450ng/l) had worse baseline cognitive function, including reaction time (mean difference high vs low group = 3.07 seconds, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 5.32), processing speed (-1.02 digits coded, 95% CI = -1.65 to -0.39), and immediate memory (-0.13 pictures remembered, 95% CI = -0.29 to 0.04). There was no significant difference in delayed memory (-0.14, 95% CI = -0.38 to 0.10) between the NT-proBNP groups. Participants with higher NT-proBNP had a steeper cognitive decline, including reaction time (mean annual change high vs low group = 0.60 seconds, 95% CI = 0.14 to 1.07), processing speed (-0.15 digits coded, 95% CI = -0.25 to -0.05), immediate memory (-0.05 pictures remembered, 95% CI = -0.09 to 0.00), and delayed memory (-0.05 pictures remembered, 95% CI = -0.11 to 0.01).

BACKGROUND B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) plays a key role in the regulation of volume homeostasis, and elevated blood levels of BNP are associated with end-stage renal disease. Renal transplantation leads to a decrease of elevated BNP levels with established graft function. Assessment of N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) is established as reflecting volume homeostasis, and we therefore studied the relationship between NT-proBNP and allograft function in a prospective study. METHODS NT-proBNP was assessed in 76 patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing renal transplantation. Patients were grouped according to immediate or delayed graft function. The degree of allograft function was assessed from the estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the MDRD formula. RESULTS In patients with immediate graft function (n = 48), median NT-proBNP decreased immediately after transplantation; in patients with delayed function (n = 28), median NT-proBNP first increased and then decreased as function improved. Patients with early acute rejection showed significantly higher NT-proBNP levels prior to transplantation than patients without rejection. NT-proBNP levels measured 2 or 3 weeks post-transplant were significantly correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate 1 year after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS An association was observed between renal allograft function and post-transplant levels of NT-proBNP. The association was not found to be a useful general predictor for graft function in individual patients in a clinical setting, as the range of NT-proBNP levels measured was too wide."

BACKGROUND Heart disease is the major cause of death in thalassemia patients. Repeated blood transfusions and hemolysis cause iron overload and also disrupts the hydroxylation and synthesis of vitamin D, causing vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with cardiac dysfunction. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine the association between vitamin D levels and left ventricular function and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in thalassemia major children with iron overload. PATIENTS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted in March-April 2015 in the thalassemia clinic, Department of Child Health, Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia. Thirty-four children with thalassemia were enrolled consecutively. Serum vitamin D and NT-proBNP levels were measured with electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) method and echocardiography was performed to assess ventricular function. RESULTS Significant correlations were found between vitamin D levels and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (r = 0.399, P = 0.019) and fractional shortening (FS) (r = 0.394, P = 0.021). There was also significant correlation between vitamin D and NT-proBNP levels (r = -0.444, P = 0.008). Chi-square analysis also showed a relationship between vitamin D and NT-proBNP (P = 0.019) levels. There was a difference in NT-proBNP levels among thalassemia major children with iron overload (P = 0.020). Post hoc analysis showed that there was a significant difference in NT-proBNP levels between those with vitamin D deficiency and those with normal vitamin D levels (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION There is an association between vitamin D and left ventricular function and NT-proBNP levels in children with thalassemia major and iron overload. Vitamin D can be considered in patients with thalassemia having vitamin D deficiency."

METHODS Data of NYHA grade, echocardiographic derived parameters of cardiac function, plasma levels of NT-proANP, NT-proBNP and NT-proCNP (measured by enzyme immunoassay method) were obtained in 112 heart failure patients and 44 normal control subjects. The correlation analysis was made between NT-proANP, NT-proBNP, NT-proCNP and NYHA functional class, left atrium diameter (LAD), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), respectively. RESULTS The plasma concentrations of NT-proANP, NT-proBNP and NT-proCNP in heart failure patients were significantly higher than in control group (all P<0.05). Correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between NT-proANP and NT-proBNP (r = 0.790, P = 0.000) and a weak correlation between NT-proCNP and NT-proBNP (r = 0.278, P = 0.003) as well as between NT-proCNP and NT-proANP (r = 0.236, P = 0.012) in heart failure patients. Univariant analysis showed that NT-proANP and NT-proBNP were positively correlated to LAD, LVEDD and negatively correlated to LVEF (all P<0.05) while there was no significant correlation between NT-proCNP and echocardiographic derived parameters of cardiac function in heart failure patients. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis including age, gender, NYHA classification, LAD, LVEDD and LVEF revealed that NYHA classification, LVEF, LAD and age were independent predictors of NT-proANP; while NYHA classification, LVEF and age were independent predictors of NT-proBNP while there was no association among these factors and NT-proCNP. CONCLUSION In heart failure patients, the plasma concentration of NT-proANP, NT-proBNP and NT-proCNP were significantly increased and NT-proANP, NT-proBNP but not NT-proCNP were significantly correlated to NYHA classification and echocardiographic derived parameters of cardiac function."

Objective- NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) and cardiac troponin T (cTNT) are associated with cognitive performance. Whether this extends to individuals <60 years of age is unclear. We investigated whether age modified the associations between NT-proBNP and cTNT and cognitive performance and structural brain changes. Approach and Results- In 3011 individuals (60\u00b18 years; 49% women), NT-proBNP and cTNT, memory, information processing speed and executive functioning, grey matter (GM) and white matter, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes were determined. We used regression, adjusted for educational level, cardiovascular factors, and lifestyle factors, to test whether cross-sectional associations between biomarkers and cognitive performance and structural brain changes were modified by age (<60 versus \u226560 years). \u226560 years, higher NT-proBNP was associated with lower memory (\u03b2 [SD] per 10-fold higher level [95% confidence interval (CI)], -0.11 [-0.22 to -0.00]), information processing speed (-0.12 [95% CI, -0.21 to -0.03]), executive functioning (-0.12 [95% CI, -0.22 to -0.03]), and smaller GM (\u03b2 [mL] per 10-fold higher level, -6.89 [95% CI, -11.58 to -2.20]). Additionally, higher cTNT was associated with lower memory (-0.33 [95% CI, -0.53 to -0.12]) and information processing speed (-0.17 [95% CI, -0.3 to -0.01]); with smaller GM (-16.07 [95% CI, -24.90 to -7.24]) and greater WMH (10\u03b2 WMH per 10-fold higher level, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.10-0.52]). <60 years, NT-proBNP and cTNT were not associated with cognitive performance ( Pinteraction, <0.10). In contrast, higher NT-proBNP was associated with smaller GM (-7.43 [95% CI, -11.70 to -3.16]) and greater WMH (0.13 [95% CI, 0.01-0.25]; Pinteraction,>0.10). Higher cTNT was associated with greater WMH (0.18 [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.37]; Pinteraction,>0.10) but not with GM (0.07 [95% CI, -6.87 to 7.02]; Pinteraction, <0.10). Conclusions- Biomarkers of cardiac injury are continuously associated with structural brain changes in both older and younger individuals but with poorer cognitive performance only in older individuals. These findings stress the continuous nature of the heart-brain axis in the development of cognitive impairment."

The growth and differentiation factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) regulates cardiac development during vertebrate embryogenesis. In cardiac precursor cells, BMP-2 has recently been shown to induce expression of cardiac transcription factors, including myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF-2A). The specific signal transduction mechanism by which BMP-2 regulates these actions is not known. We investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in regulating these processes in cardiomyocyte precursor CL6 cells. BMP-2 increased PI 3-kinase activity in these cells in a time-dependent manner, resulting in increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase abolished these actions of BMP-2, indicating the involvement of PI 3-kinase in these processes. Furthermore, BMP-2 stimulated specific protein.DNA complex formation when an MEF-2 DNA recognition element was used as probe. Antibody supershift assay confirmed the presence of MEF-2A in this protein.DNA complex. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity completely prevented the MEF-2A.DNA complex formation. BMP-2 also increased transcription of a reporter gene driven by an MEF-2-specific DNA element in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of MEF-2A increased BMP-2 transcription to the same extent induced by BMP-2, indicating that MEF-2A may participate in BMP-2 autoregulation in CL6 cells. Expression of dominant negative PI 3-kinase completely abolished BMP-2-induced as well as MEF-2A-mediated BMP-2 transcription. Furthermore expression of MEF-2A increased MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Together these data provide the first evidence that BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase signaling regulates MEF-2A expression and define a mechanism of MEF-2A-dependent BMP-2 transcription."

Myeloid Elf-1 like factor (MEF) is a member of the Ets transcription factor family. Ets family proteins control the expression of genes that are critical for biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Some of Ets factors are also known to regulate bone development. In this study, we investigated the role of MEF in osteoblast differentiation. MEF expression was highest early in the differentiation of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and was reduced by treatment with BMP-2. The expression of MEF suppressed the alkaline phosphatase activity and expression induced by BMP-2 stimulation and mediated by Runx2. The expression of MEF also reduces osteocalcin mRNA levels, and mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells. We found that the MEF-mediated suppression of osteogenic differentiation was critically related to Runx2 regulation. The MEF and Runx2 proteins physically interact to form a complex, and this interaction interferes with Runx2 binding to the cis-acting element OSE2 derived from the osteocalcin promoter. Co-transfection of MEF inhibited the 6xOSE2-luciferase reporter activity induced by Runx2. In addition, MEF stimulated the transcription of a negative mediator Msx2, and a transcriptional repressor, Mab21L1, and suppressed the transcription of a positive mediator, Dlx5 in osteoblast differentiation. MEF overexpression stimulated C2C12 cell proliferation. Together, our findings suggest that MEF promotes cell proliferation and functions as a negative regulator of osteogenic differentiation by directly interacting with Runx2 and suppressing its transcriptional activity."

Although the transcriptional programs driving Th2 cell differentiation and cytokine production are well defined, dependence on these classical Th2 programs by Tfh2 cells is less clear. Using cytokine reporter mice in combination with transcription factor inference analysis, the b-Zip transcription factor c-Maf and its targets were identified as an important regulon in both Th2 and Tfh2 cells. Conditional deletion of c-Maf in T cells confirmed its importance in type-2 cytokine expression by Th2 and Tfh2 cells. However, while c-Maf was not required for Th2-driven helminth clearance or lung eosinophilia, it was required for Tfh2-driven Immunoglobulin E production and germinal center formation. This differential regulation of cell-mediated and humoral immunity by c-Maf was a result of redundant pathways in Th2 cells that were absent in Tfh2 cells, and c-Maf-specific mechanisms in Tfh2 cells that were absent in Th2 cells. Thus, despite shared expression by Tfh2 and Th2 cells, c-Maf serves as a unique regulator of Tfh2-driven humoral hallmarks during type-2 immunity."

Cardiomyocyte differentiation was evaluated using 3 parent (H1, H7, and H9) hES cell lines and 2 clonal (H9.1 and H9.2) hES cell lines. All cell lines examined differentiated into cardiomyocytes, even after long-term culture (50 passages or approximately 260 population doublings). Upon differentiation, beating cells were observed after one week in differentiation conditions, increased in numbers with time, and could retain contractility for over 70 days. The beating cells expressed markers characteristic of cardiomyocytes, such as cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin I and T, atrial natriuretic factor, and cardiac transcription factors GATA-4, Nkx2.5, and MEF-2. In addition, cardiomyocyte differentiation could be enhanced by treatment of cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine but not DMSO or retinoic acid. Furthermore, the differentiated cultures could be dissociated and enriched by Percoll density centrifugation to give a population containing 70% cardiomyocytes. The enriched population was proliferative and showed appropriate expression of cardiomyocyte markers.

BACKGROUND A significant decrease in mean cardiomyocyte DNA content and increased numbers of diploid cardiomyocytes after unloading has been demonstrated, suggesting a numerical increase of cardiomyocytes. Despite a thorough search in that study, no mitoses explaining a potential net increase of cardiomyocytes has been observed. The heart harbors several stem cell populations, including c-kit (CD117)(+) stem cells and side population cells (SPC), which may proliferate after unloading and thus contribute to the generation of diploid cardiomyocytes. In this study we sought to determine, whether there is an increase of ABCG2(+) SPC and CD117(+) stem cells after unloading. METHODS In paired myocardial samples (prior to and after LVAD), the number of cells with immunoexpression of ABCG2, c-kit/CD117 and MEF-2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Their number was morphometrically determined and these data were correlated with the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content. RESULTS A significant increase of SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit and MEF-2 after unloading was observed from 0.00013% in CHF to 0.0011%, and 0.013% to 0.035%, respectively after unloading (p = 0.001). A significant positive correlation between both SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit and MEF-2 expression was observed (p = 0.007 and 0.01). No correlation was found between the number of SPC and the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content. CONCLUSIONS SPC are increased significantly in the myocardium after ventricular unloading, suggesting a role for stem cell proliferation during \"reverse cardiac remodeling.\" These cells might proliferate and commit to different cell lineages, such as cardiomyocytes or endothelium, and thus ameliorate cardiac function."

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) for repairing damaged heart tissue are a new kind of important treatment options because of their potential to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. We in this experiment investigated the effect of different electrical stimulation time on the expression of myocardial specificity gene and protein in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) in vitro. The rBMSCs of second or third generation were randomly divided into three groups, i.e, electrical stimulation (ES) group, 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) group and the control group. The rBMSCs in the ES groups with complete medium were exposed to 2 V, 2 Hz, 5 ms electrical stimulation for 0. 5 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h respectively every day for 10 days. Those in the 5-Aza group were induced by 5-Aza (10 \u03bcmol/L) for 24 h, and then cultured with complete medium for 10 days. Those in the control group were only cultured with complete medium, without any treatment, for 10 days. The rBMSCs' morphological feature in each group was observed with inverted phase microscope. The mRNA expression of myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF-2C) and connexin 43 (Cx43) were examined with Real-Time quantitative PCR and the protein expression of MEF-2C, Cx43 were detected with Western Blot method. The results showed that the mRNA expression level of the MEF-2C, Cx43 and the protein expression level of MEF-2C, Cx43 were significantly higher in the ES group and 5-Aza group than those in the relative control group (P < 0.05). It suggests that electrical stimulation could play a part of role in the induction of the rBMSCs to differentiate into the cariomyocyte-like cells in vitro and the effectiveness of the electrical stimulation with 2 h/d had the best in our experiment. But the mechanism how electrical stimulation promotes the differentiation of rBMSC into cardiomyocyte is still unclear."

The efficient induction of cardiomyocyte differentiation from embryonic stem (ES) cells is crucial for cardiac regenerative medicine. Although Wnts play important roles in cardiac development, complex questions remain as to when, how and what types of Wnts are involved in cardiogenesis. We found that Wnt2 was strongly up-regulated during cardiomyocyte differentiation from ES cells. Therefore, we investigated when and how Wnt2 acts in cardiogenesis during ES cell differentiation. Wnt2 was strongly expressed in the early developing murine heart. We applied this embryonic Wnt2 expression pattern to ES cell differentiation, to elucidate Wnt2 function in cardiomyocyte differentiation. Wnt2 knockdown revealed that intrinsic Wnt2 was essential for efficient cardiomyocyte differentiation from ES cells. Moreover, exogenous Wnt2 increased cardiomyocyte differentiation from ES cells. Interestingly, the effects on cardiogenesis of intrinsic Wnt2 knockdown and exogenous Wnt2 addition were temporally restricted. During cardiomyocyte differentiation from ES cells, Wnt2 didn't activate canonical Wnt pathway but utilizes JNK/AP-1 pathway which is required for cardiomyocyte differentiation from ES cells. Therefore we conclude that Wnt2 plays strong positive stage-specific role in cardiogenesis through non-canonical Wnt pathway in murine ES cells."

Myostatin is well established as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth, but its role in the heart is controversial. Our goal in this study was to characterize myostatin regulation following cardiomyocyte stress and to examine the role of myostatin in the regulation of cardiomyocyte size. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were cultured and stressed with phenylephrine. Adenovirus was used to overexpress myostatin or dominant negative myostatin in culture. Adeno-associated virus was used to overexpress myostatin or dominant negative myostatin in mice. Myostatin is upregulated following cardiomyocyte stress in an Erk-dependent manner that is associated with increased nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of MEF-2. Myostatin overexpression leads to decreased and myostatin inhibition to increased cardiac growth both in vitro and in vivo due to modulation of Akt and NFAT3 pathways. Myostatin is a negative regulator of cardiac growth, and further studies are warranted to investigate the role of myostatin in the healthy and failing heart."

PURPOSE Endocrine therapy is the anti-tumor therapy for human breast cancer but endocrine resistance was a major burden. It has been reported that Palbociclib and fulvestrant can be used in combination for the treatment of patients who are experiencing endocrine resistance. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism by which Palbocicilib affected ER-positive breast cancer, combined with fulvestrant. METHODS We first detected the effect of palbociclib on cell survival, growth and cycle distribution separately by MTT, colony formation and flow cytometry. Then SNHG17 was screened as palbociclib-targeted LncRNA by LncRNA-seq, and the SNHG17-targeted mRNAs were selected by mRNA-seq for further determination. Subsequently, the underlying mechanism by which palbociclib promoted the cytotoxicity of fulvestrant was confirmed by qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunoprecipitation. Eventually, the xenograft model and immunohistochemistry experiments were used to validate the sensitization effect of palbociclib on fulvestrant and its mechanism in vivo. RESULTS Palbociclib significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of fulvestrant in fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cell lines. Interestingly, this might be related to the lncRNA SNHG17 and the Hippo signaling pathway. And our subsequent western blotting experiments confirmed that overexpressing SNHG17 induced the down-regulation of LATS1 and up-regulated YAP expression. Furthermore, we found that the increased sensitivity of breast cancer cells was closely associated with the LATS1-mediated degradation of ER-\u03b1. The following animal experiments also indicated that overexpressing SNHG17 obviously impaired the anti-cancer effect of co-treatment of palbociclib and fulvestrant accompanied by decreased LATS1 and increased ER-\u03b1 levels. CONCLUSION Palbociclib might sensitize the cytotoxicity of fulvestrant in ER-positive breast cancer cells by down-regulating SNHG17 expression, and then resulted in the LATS1-inactivated oncogene YAP and LATS1-mediated degradation of ER-\u03b1."

WHAT IS THIS SUMMARY ABOUT? This is a summary of an article that reported results of a study using data from two phase 3 clinical trials called \"PALOMA-2\" and \"PALOMA-3.\" Both PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3 trials included women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. HR+/HER2- breast cancer means the breast cancer cells of these women have receptors for female sex hormones and little or no HER2 receptors. Both PALOMA trials tested the effect of adding a medication called palbociclib (brand name, Ibrance\u00ae) to a hormone therapy. Hormone therapy, also known as endocrine therapy, is a treatment that blocks or removes hormones that cause cancer cells to grow and divide. In both trials, women took endocrine therapy with either palbociclib or a placebo. WHAT WAS THE AIM OF THIS STUDY? The researchers aimed to see if the results from the PALOMA trials were similar for subgroups of women in the 2 trials. The subgroups in the study included women who shared certain features about their cancer or treatment history, for example, women whose cancer had spread to the liver. For each subgroup, the study compared the results from the 2 treatment groups: (1) women who took palbociclib plus endocrine therapy, and (2) women who took placebo plus endocrine therapy. WHAT WERE THE RESULTS & WHAT DO THEY MEAN? The same effect was found in all subgroups. Compared with those who took placebo, women who took palbociclib lived longer without their cancer getting worse (growing or spreading). Also, among women who had chemotherapy after stopping the trial treatment, those who took palbociclib started chemotherapy later than those who took placebo. Because palbociclib slows cancer growth and leads to tumor shrinkage, this may have played a part in starting chemotherapy later. These results show that palbociclib plus endocrine therapy is better at slowing the progression of advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer than endocrine therapy alone. This can be said for women with different advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer features and treatment history. Overall, the results support women taking palbociclib with an endocrine therapy if they have advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer."

Background: Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors are now the standard of care for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER-) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, guidelines are lacking regarding their optimal sequencing with other available agents. This study examines physician practice patterns and treatment outcomes of palbociclib and subsequent therapies in a real-world setting. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted for consecutive patients with MBC who received palbociclib between February 2015 and August 2017 at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center. Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate time-to-event curves and estimate median progression-free survival (mPFS). Log-rank test was used to compare differences. Results: A total of 200 patients, with a median age of 59.4 years and a follow-up of 19.5 months, were included. Palbociclib was most frequently combined with letrozole (73.5%), followed by fulvestrant (25%), anastrozole (1%), and tamoxifen (0.5%). Most patients received palbociclib in the endocrine-resistant setting (n=42, n=50, and n=108 in the first-, second-, and subsequent-line settings, respectively), and the fraction of patients receiving palbociclib as first- or second-line therapy increased in recent months (P=.0428). mPFS was 20.7, 12.8, and 4.0 months with palbociclib administered in the first-, second-, and subsequent-line settings, respectively (P<.0001). Incidences of grade 3/4 neutropenia (41.5%) and dose reductions (29%) were comparable to reports in the literature. Among patients whose disease progressed on palbociclib (n=104), the most frequent next-line treatment was capecitabine (n=21), followed by eribulin (n=16), nab-paclitaxel (n=15), and exemestane + everolimus (n=12). mPFS with hormone therapy alone or in combination with targeted agents (n=32) after first-, second-, and subsequent-line palbociclib was 17.0, 9.3, and 4.2 months, respectively (P=.04). mPFS with chemotherapy (n=70) was not reached, 4.7, and 4.1 months after first-, second-, and subsequent-line palbociclib, respectively (P=.56). Conclusions: Palbociclib is effective for HR+/HER2- MBC in real-world practice. Hormone therapy alone or in combination with targeted agents remains an effective option after palbociclib progression."

Palbociclib is a good candidate for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) due to its narrow therapeutic range and frequency of toxicities, particularly high-grade neutropenia. In this prospective, bicentric clinical trial, we evaluated the palbociclib exposure\u2212toxicity relationship and determined the relevant sources of palbociclib pharmacokinetic variability, including drug\u2212drug interactions (DDI). We followed 58 patients (mean age: 62.9 years) for 1 year. The geometric median of palbociclib plasma trough concentration (Ctrough) was 74.1 ng/mL. Neutropenia occurred in 70.7% of patients (high grade in 67.2% of patients). High-grade neutropenia occurrence during the first two palbociclib cycles was higher in patients with lower neutrophil count at initiation (p = 0.002). Palbociclib plasma Ctrough was correlated with high-grade neutropenia occurrence during the first two cycles (p = 0.024, OR 5.51). Co-treatment with agents that may interfere with palbociclib PK significantly influenced palbociclib Ctrough (p < 0.05). CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein inhibitors increased by 25% palbociclib Ctrough (p = 0.035), while antacids reduced it by 20% (p = 0.036). However, DDI did not have any significant effect on high-grade neutropenia occurrence (p > 0.05). This study confirms the major role of TDM to manage palbociclib safe use from the first week of treatment, particularly the significant incidence of hematological toxicity. Moreover, this first dedicated prospective study confirmed the importance of characterizing co-treatments to limit the DDI risk with oral-targeted therapies."

This exploratory analysis investigated potential biomarkers of palbociclib plus ET on PFS. PATIENTS AND METHODS Of 178 patients randomized (92 palbociclib plus ET; 86 capecitabine), we performed targeted sequencing (141 patients) and whole transcriptome sequencing (165 patients) using baseline tumor samples to examine genomic alteration in relation to drug response on PFS. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using unstratified Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS PIK3CA (41%) and TP53 (33%) mutations and CCND1 copy number variation (29%) were found most frequently in targeted sequencing of 141 patients. ESR1 mutations were found only in 3.5% of patients of this population. Luminal type showed better prognosis in palbociclib + ET arm but no impact on PFS difference in capecitabine arm. High TMB, TP53 mutation, PTEN loss of function mutation and RB1 pathway alteration showed worse prognosis in palbociclib plus ET arm. Patients with BRCA2 pathogenic mutations showed worse prognosis regardless of PAM50 subtypes. AURKA mutation/amplification, BRIP1/MYC/RAD51C amplification were significantly associated to the patients with short PFS <6 month.

AIM Palbociclib is an oral cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, which is efficacious in treating breast cancer. Currently, there are numerous active clinical trials testing palbociclib alone or in combination with other medications for treating various types of malignancies. Here, we evaluated the anti-cancer effect of palbociclib in combination with radiation therapy (RT) for treating human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and addressed the molecular mechanism behind the combination therapy. METHODS Immunofluorescence staining of \u03b3H2AX or 53BP1 was used to determine the effect of palbociclib on double-strand break (DSB) repair. Clonogenic assays, sphere formation and cell death ELISA were performed to study the sensitising effect of palbociclib on radiation-induced cytotoxicity. Signal alteration in DSB repair pathways was examined by Western blot analysis. Finally, we evaluated the in vivo anti-cancer activity and the associated molecular events of the combination therapy in a preclinical HCC xenograft model. RESULTS Palbociclib affected the kinetics of DNA repair and enhanced the radiation sensitivity of HCC and CCA cells. Importantly, we found that palbociclib inhibits ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase, the key upstream kinase responding to RT-induced DSBs. Furthermore, we showed that the inhibitory effect of palbociclib on RT-induced ATM kinase activation is mediated by protein phosphatase 5 (PP5). Both in vitro and in vivo investigations revealed that the inhibition of the PP5-ATM axis by palbociclib after DNA damage is responsible for the synergism between palbociclib and RT.

BACKGROUND Palbociclib is a small-molecule, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor, which prevents phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and inhibits cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase. We performed this meta-analysis to estimate the safety and efficacy of palbociclib in cancer patients from clinical trials. METHODS PubMed and EMBASE were searched for eligible studies. Adverse events (AE) of grade \u22653 and all-grade (1-5) were extracted to calculate event rates. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to estimate the safety of palbociclib in endocrine treatment-combined studies. A fixed effects model was used when homogeneity was low (I2 \u2264 50%). A random effects model was adopted when there was a significant heterogeneity (I2 > 50%). For efficacy endpoints, hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI for progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS Nine clinical trials representing 1534 patients were identified. The most frequently observed all-grade adverse events (AEs) in patients treated with palbociclib were neutropenia (event rate: 68.1%), leukopenia (51.7%), fatigue (35.9%), anemia (34.7%), and thrombocytopenia (30.9%). The most common grade 3 or more toxicities were neutropenia (51.6%), leukopenia (29.4%), and thrombocytopenia (7.5%). Hematologic adverse events had high occurrence in the palbociclib group. The pooled analysis of survival outcomes suggested that palbociclib produced clinical benefits in breast cancers and Rb-positive tumors. More specifically, palbociclib was associated with significant improvement of PFS (HR: 0.518, 95% CI: 0.444-0.604) in the treatment of ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS Hematologic adverse events were common in palbociclib-treated cancer patients. Since palbociclib produced a higher PFS rate with a low serious complication rate, it can be a promising novel target therapy drug for treating ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer."

In this study, we evaluated the pathophysiological response of the neuroglobin gene and protein expression in the cerebral tissue of rats sustaining traumatic brain injury of differing severity, while simultaneously measuring the oxidant/antioxidant balance. Two levels of trauma (mild and severe) were induced in anesthetized animals using the weight-drop model of diffuse axonal injury. Rats were then sacrificed at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 120 h after traumatic brain injury, and the gene and protein expression of neuroglobin and the concentrations of malondialdehyde (as a parameter representative of reactive oxygen species-mediated damage), nitrite + nitrate (indicative of NO metabolism), ascorbate, and glutathione (GSH) were determined in the brain tissue. Results indicated that mild traumatic brain injury, although causing a reversible increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress (increase in malondialdehyde and nitrite + nitrate) and an imbalance in antioxidants (decrease in ascorbate and GSH), did not induce any change in neuroglobin. Conversely, severe traumatic brain injury caused an over nine- and a fivefold increase in neuroglobin gene and protein expression, respectively, as well as a remarkable increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress and depletion of antioxidants.

There is a significant need for novel treatments that will improve traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes. One potential neuroprotective mechanism is to increase oxygen binding proteins such as neuroglobin. Neuroglobin has a high affinity for oxygen, is an effective free radical scavenger, and is neuroprotective within the brain following hypoxia and ischemia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether neuroglobin overexpression improves sensorimotor outcomes following TBI in transgenic neuroglobin overexpressing (NGB) mice. Additional study aims were to determine if and when an endogenous neuroglobin response occurred following TBI in wild-type (WT) mice, and in what brain regions and cell types the response occurred. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) was performed in adult (5 month) C57/BL6 WT mice, and NGB mice constitutively overexpressing neuroglobin via the chicken beta actin promoter coupled with the cytomegalovirus distal enhancer. The gridwalk task was used for sensorimotor testing of both WT and NGB mice, prior to injury, and at 2, 3, and 7 days post-TBI. NGB mice displayed significant reductions in the average number of foot faults per minute walking at 2, 3, and 7 days post-TBI when compared to WT mice at each time point.

These results showed that overexpression of neuroglobin reduced sensorimotor deficits following TBI, and that an endogenous increase in neuroglobin expression occurs during the subacute period. Increasing neuroglobin expression through novel therapeutic interventions during the acute period after TBI may improve recovery."

BACKGROUND Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that over-expression of Neuroglobin (Ngb) is neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemic brain injuries. In this study we tested the neuroprotective effects of Ngb over-expression against traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice. RESULTS Both Ngb over-expression transgenic (Ngb-Tg) and wild-type (WT) control mice were subjected to TBI induced by a controlled cortical impact (CCI) device. TBI significantly increased Ngb expression in the brains of both WT and Ngb-Tg mice, but Ngb-Tg mice had significantly higher Ngb protein levels at the pre-injury baseline and post-TBI. Production of oxidative tissue damage biomarker 3NT in the brain was significantly reduced in Ngb-Tg mice compared to WT controls at 6 hours after TBI. The traumatic brain lesion volume was significantly reduced in Ngb Tg mice compared to WT mice at 3 weeks after TBI; however, there were no significant differences in the recovery of sensorimotor and spatial memory functional deficits between Ngb-Tg and WT control mice for up to 3 weeks after TBI. CONCLUSION Ngb over-expression reduced traumatic lesion volume, which might partially be achieved by decreasing oxidative stress."

Astrocytes play an important role in physiological, metabolic, and structural functions, and when impaired, they can be involved in various pathologies including Alzheimer, focal ischemic stroke, and traumatic brain injury. These disorders involve an imbalance in the blood flow and nutrients such as glucose and lactate, leading to biochemical and molecular changes that cause neuronal damage, which is followed by loss of cognitive and motor functions. Previous studies have shown that astrocytes are more resilient than neurons during brain insults as a consequence of their more effective antioxidant systems, transporters, and enzymes, which made them less susceptible to excitotoxicity. In addition, astrocytes synthesize and release different protective molecules for neurons, including neuroglobin, a member of the globin family of proteins. After brain injury, neuroglobin expression is induced in astrocytes. Since neuroglobin promotes neuronal survival, its increased expression in astrocytes after brain injury may represent an endogenous neuroprotective mechanism. Here, we review the role of neuroglobin in the central nervous system, its relationship with different pathologies, and the role of different factors that regulate its expression in astrocytes."

Dr. Nakazato Masamitsu reported that NERP-1 and -2 may have a local modulator function on the human endocrine system, and clearly showed expression of NERP-1 and -2 in human pancreas islets. Based on these data, we investigated the alteration of insulin secretion, insulin granule-related protein, and pancreas-specific transcription factors in response to NERPs expression. We confirmed the expression of NERP-1 and -2 in the pancreas of a human diabetes patient, in addition to diabetic animal models. When INS1 cells and primary rat islets were incubated with 10nM NERPs for 3 days, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion levels were blunted by NERP-1 and -2. The number of insulin granules released from the readily releasable pool, which is associated with the first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin release, was decreased by NERP-1 and -2. Insulin granule-related proteins and mRNAs were down-regulated by NERP-2 treatment. NERP-2 decreased the expression of BETA2/NeuroD and insulin and controlled the nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of FOXO1 and Pdx-1. We observed that NERP-2 levels were dramatically increased in diabetic pancreas. In conclusion, NERP-2 may play an important role in insulin secretion through the regulation of insulin secretory granules and \u03b2-cell transcription factors. In addition, NERP-2 expression is increased in diabetic conditions. Therefore, we suggest that NERPs may be potent endogenous suppressors of glucose-dependent insulin secretion."

The role of P2 purinoceptor agonists in regulatory insulin secretion in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats was studied using the isolated perfused pancreas and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) microfluorimetry. The relative potency of different purinoceptor agonists to stimulate the insulin secretory process was consistent with the conclusion that responses in [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion are mediated by the P2y subtype of purinoceptors. Additional studies using specific antagonists of the Ca2+ signaling pathway indicated that activation of P2y purinoceptor releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores and promotes Ca2+ entry through voltage-independent rather than voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels on the beta-cell membrane. Perfused pancreas and isolated islets from ZDF rats demonstrated markedly reduced or absent insulin secretion and [Ca2+]i responses to glucose and KCl. In contrast, responses to P2y purinoceptor agonists were normal, indicating that the secretion coupling pathway activated by these agonists is preserved in glucose-unresponsive islets from diabetic animals.

L-Triiodothyronine (L-T3) treatment as well as propylthiouracil (PTU) treatment decreased the immediate insulin secretory response of the pancreas slightly. Only thyroidectomy (Tx) reduced the immediate secretory response of the pancreas significantly.

When changes in body weight, rectal temperature, plasma glucose, plasma cholesterol, and plasma butanol-extractable iodine (BEI) in these rats were compared with the insulin secretory responses, it was evident that experimental hyperthyroidism results in decreased insulin release, whereas experimental hypothyroidism induces increased insulin secretion from the pancreas.

Aim of our current study is to investigate the role of somatostatin at mediating the effects of NmU on insulin secretion. METHODS Expression of NmU in the pancreas was detected by immunohistochemistry. Insulin and somatostatin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and isolated pancreatic islets was measured by radioimmunoassay. The paracrine effects of somatostatin within pancreatic islets were blocked by cyclosomatostatin, a somatostatin receptor antagonist. RESULTS Receptor subtype NmUR1, but not NmUR2, was expressed in the endocrine pancreas, predominantly in the periphery. Neuromedin U reduced insulin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and stimulated somatostatin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets. Neuromedin U stimulated somatostatin secretion at both physiological and supraphysiological glucose concentrations. Cyclosomatostatin increased insulin secretion and reduced NmU-induced inhibition of insulin secretion. CONCLUSIONS Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion.

Moreover, since many empty and mixed emulsion PCR beads are removed, the approach gives rise to a substantial increase in sequence quality and mean read length, as compared to that obtained by standard enrichment protocols."

One of the major questions in microbial ecology is \"who is there?\" This question can be answered using various tools, but one of the long-lasting gold standards is to sequence 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicons generated by domain-level PCR reactions amplifying from genomic DNA. Traditionally, this was performed by cloning and Sanger (capillary electrophoresis) sequencing of PCR amplicons. The advent of next-generation sequencing has tremendously simplified and increased the sequencing depth for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The introduction of benchtop sequencers now allows small labs to perform their 16S rRNA sequencing in-house in a matter of days. Here, an approach for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using a benchtop next-generation sequencer is detailed. The environmental DNA is first amplified by PCR using primers that contain sequencing adapters and barcodes. They are then coupled to spherical particles via emulsion PCR. The particles are loaded on a disposable chip and the chip is inserted in the sequencing machine after which the sequencing is performed. The sequences are retrieved in fastq format, filtered and the barcodes are used to establish the sample membership of the reads. The filtered and binned reads are then further analyzed using publically available tools. An example analysis where the reads were classified with a taxonomy-finding algorithm within the software package Mothur is given. The method outlined here is simple, inexpensive and straightforward and should help smaller labs to take advantage from the ongoing genomic revolution."

BACKGROUND Genotyping and massively-parallel sequencing projects result in a vast amount of diploid data that is only rarely resolved into its constituent haplotypes. It is nevertheless this phased information that is transmitted from one generation to the next and is most directly associated with biological function and the genetic causes of biological effects. Despite progress made in genome-wide sequencing and phasing algorithms and methods, problems assembling (and reconstructing linear haplotypes in) regions of repetitive DNA and structural variation remain. These dynamic and structurally complex regions are often poorly understood from a sequence point of view. Regions such as these that are highly similar in their sequence tend to be collapsed onto the genome assembly. This is turn means downstream determination of the true sequence haplotype in these regions poses a particular challenge. For structurally complex regions, a more focussed approach to assembling haplotypes may be required. RESULTS In order to investigate reconstruction of spatial information at structurally complex regions, we have used an emulsion haplotype fusion PCR approach to reproducibly link sequences of up to 1kb in length to allow phasing of multiple variants from neighbouring loci, using allele-specific PCR and sequencing to detect the phase. By using emulsion systems linking flanking regions to amplicons within the CNV, this led to the reconstruction of a 59kb haplotype across the DEFA1A3 CNV in HapMap individuals. CONCLUSION This study has demonstrated a novel use for emulsion haplotype fusion PCR in addressing the issue of reconstructing structural haplotypes at multiallelic copy variable regions, using the DEFA1A3 locus as an example."

Two human genomic DNA samples were used and conducted the successive experiments for sequencing library construction: shearing fragmentation by sonication, blunt-ending and phosphorylation, adaptor ligation, 150-200 bp fragments size selection, followed by hybridization with the baits, hybrid selection with magnetic beads, and PCR amplification. Prior to SOLiD sequencing reaction, the libraries were amplified with emulsion PCR and enriched with the P2 enrichment beads. The library samples were loaded to sequencing Chip for Work Flow Analysis (WFA) or sequencing running with default parameters. The results displayed that 46 509 baits were designed and synthesized for 11,147 gene regions, and SureSelect capture probe regent was prepared. Real-time PCR showed the target enrichment efficiency up to 2(9) times with the SureSelect system. WFA revealed that the libraries were suitable for SOLiD Sequencing.

Enhancers and promoters both regulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors (TFs); however, the degree to which enhancer vs. promoter activity is due to differences in their sequences or to genomic context is the subject of ongoing debate. We examined this question by analyzing the sequences of thousands of transcribed enhancers and promoters from hundreds of cellular contexts previously identified by cap analysis of gene expression. Support vector machine classifiers trained on counts of all possible 6-bp-long sequences (6-mers) were able to accurately distinguish promoters from enhancers and distinguish their breadth of activity across tissues. Classifiers trained to predict enhancer activity also performed well when applied to promoter prediction tasks, but promoter-trained classifiers performed poorly on enhancers. This suggests that the learned sequence patterns predictive of enhancer activity generalize to promoters, but not vice versa. Our classifiers also indicate that there are functionally relevant differences in enhancer and promoter GC content beyond the influence of CpG islands. Furthermore, sequences characteristic of broad promoter or broad enhancer activity matched different TFs, with predicted ETS- and RFX-binding sites indicative of promoters, and AP-1 sites indicative of enhancers. Finally, we evaluated the ability of our models to distinguish enhancers and promoters defined by histone modifications. Separating these classes was substantially more difficult, and this difference may contribute to ongoing debates about the similarity of enhancers and promoters. In summary, our results suggest that high-confidence transcribed enhancers and promoters can largely be distinguished based on biologically relevant sequence properties."

The ChIP-seq signal of histone modifications at promoters is a good predictor of gene expression in different cellular contexts, but whether this is also true at enhancers is not clear. To address this issue, we develop quantitative models to characterize the relationship of gene expression with histone modifications at enhancers or promoters. We use embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which contain a full spectrum of active and repressed (poised) enhancers, to train predictive models. As many poised enhancers in ESCs switch towards an active state during differentiation, predictive models can also be trained on poised enhancers throughout differentiation and in development. Remarkably, we determine that histone modifications at enhancers, as well as promoters, are predictive of gene expression in ESCs and throughout differentiation and development. Importantly, we demonstrate that their contribution to the predictive models varies depending on their location in enhancers or promoters. Moreover, we use a local regression (LOESS) to normalize sequencing data from different sources, which allows us to apply predictive models trained in a specific cellular context to a different one. We conclude that the relationship between gene expression and histone modifications at enhancers is universal and different from promoters.

BACKGROUND Gene expression is epigenetically regulated by a combination of histone modifications and methylation of CpG dinucleotides in promoters. In normal cells, CpG-rich promoters are typically unmethylated, marked with histone modifications such as H3K4me3, and are highly active. During neoplastic transformation, CpG dinucleotides of CG-rich promoters become aberrantly methylated, corresponding with the removal of active histone modifications and transcriptional silencing. Outside of promoter regions, distal enhancers play a major role in the cell type-specific regulation of gene expression. Enhancers, which function by bringing activating complexes to promoters through chromosomal looping, are also modulated by a combination of DNA methylation and histone modifications. RESULTS Here we use HCT116 colorectal cancer cells with and without mutations in DNA methyltransferases, the latter of which results in a 95% reduction in global DNA methylation levels. These cells are used to study the relationship between DNA methylation, histone modifications, and gene expression. We find that the loss of DNA methylation is not sufficient to reactivate most of the silenced promoters. In contrast, the removal of DNA methylation results in the activation of a large number of enhancer regions as determined by the acquisition of active histone marks. CONCLUSIONS Although the transcriptome is largely unaffected by the loss of DNA methylation, we identify two distinct mechanisms resulting in the upregulation of distinct sets of genes. One is a direct result of DNA methylation loss at a set of promoter regions and the other is due to the presence of new intragenic enhancers."

BACKGROUND Pax6 is a key regulator of the entire cascade of ocular lens formation through specific binding to promoters and enhancers of batteries of target genes. The promoters and enhancers communicate with each other through DNA looping mediated by multiple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions and are marked by specific combinations of histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Enhancers are distinguished from bulk chromatin by specific modifications of core histone H3, including H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, while promoters show increased H3K4me3 PTM. Previous studies have shown the presence of Pax6 in as much as 1/8 of lens-specific enhancers but a much smaller fraction of tissue-specific promoters. Although Pax6 is known to interact with EP300/p300 histone acetyltransferase responsible for generation of H3K27ac, a potential link between Pax6 and histone H3K4 methylation remains to be established. RESULTS Here we show that Pax6 co-purifies with H3K4 methyltransferase activity in lens cell nuclear extracts. Proteomic studies show that Pax6 immunoprecipitates with Set1a, Mll1, and Mll2 enzymes, and their associated proteins, i.e., Wdr5, Rbbp5, Ash2l, and Dpy30. ChIP-seq studies using chromatin prepared from mouse lens and cultured lens cells demonstrate that Pax6-bound regions are mostly enriched with H3K4me2 and H3K4me1 in enhancers and promoters, though H3K4me3 marks only Pax6-containing promoters. The shRNA-mediated knockdown of Pax6 revealed down-regulation of a set of direct target genes, including Cap2, Farp1, Pax6, Plekha1, Prox1, Tshz2, and Zfp536. Pax6 knockdown was accompanied by reduced H3K4me1 at enhancers and H3K4me3 at promoters, with little or no changes of the H3K4me2 modifications. These changes were prominent in Plekha1, a gene regulated by Pax6 in both lens and retinal pigmented epithelium. CONCLUSIONS Our study supports a general model of Pax6-mediated recruitment of histone methyltransferases Mll1 and Mll2 to lens chromatin, especially at distal enhancers. Genome-wide data in lens show that Pax6 binding correlates with H3K4me2, consistent with the idea that H3K4me2 PTMs correlate with the binding of transcription factors. Importantly, partial reduction of Pax6 induces prominent changes in local H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 modification. Together, these data open the field to mechanistic studies of Pax6, Mll1, Mll2, and H3K4me1/2/3 dynamics at distal enhancers and promoters of developmentally controlled genes."

DNA methylation also reversibly regulates H3K27ac and H3K27me3 at previously identified tissue-specific enhancers. These effects require DNMT catalytic activity.

JIL-1 is also required for CREB binding protein (CBP)-mediated acetylation of Lys27, a well-characterized mark of active enhancers. The presence of these proteins at enhancers and promoters of ecdysone-induced genes results in the establishment of the H3K9acS10ph and H3K27acS28ph marks at both regulatory sequences. These modifications are necessary for the recruitment of 14-3-3, a scaffolding protein capable of facilitating interactions between two simultaneously bound proteins. Chromatin conformation capture assays indicate that interaction between the enhancer and the promoter is dependent on the presence of JIL-1, 14-3-3, and CBP.

H3K27ac is also widely used to identify active enhancers, and the assumption has been that profiling H3K27ac is a comprehensive way of cataloguing the set of active enhancers in mammalian cell types.

CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations result in \"leaky\" RyR2 channels due to the decreased binding of the calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) subunit, which stabilizes the closed state of the channel. We found that mice heterozygous for the R2474S mutation in Ryr2 (Ryr2-R2474S mice) exhibited spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (which occurred in the absence of cardiac arrhythmias), exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Treatment with a novel RyR2-specific compound (S107) that enhances the binding of calstabin2 to the mutant Ryr2-R2474S channel inhibited the channel leak and prevented cardiac arrhythmias and raised the seizure threshold. Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias.

Loss-of-function (LOF) RyR2 mutations have also been identified and are linked to a distinct entity of cardiac arrhythmia termed RyR2 Ca2+ release deficiency syndrome (CRDS). Exercise stress testing (EST) is routinely used to diagnose CPVT, but it is ineffective for CRDS. There is currently no effective diagnostic tool for CRDS in humans. An alternative strategy to assess the risk for CRDS is to directly determine the functional impact of the associated RyR2 mutations. To this end, we have functionally screened 18 RyR2 mutations that are associated with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) or sudden death. We found two additional RyR2 LOF mutations E4146K and G4935R. The E4146K mutation markedly suppressed caffeine activation of RyR2 and abolished store overload induced Ca2+ release (SOICR) in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. E4146K also severely reduced cytosolic Ca2+ activation and abolished luminal Ca2+ activation of single RyR2 channels.

Interestingly, the RyR2-G4935R mutant carrier had a negative EST, and the E4146K carrier had a family history of sudden death during sleep, which are different from phenotypes of typical CPVT. Thus, our data further support the link between RyR2 LOF and a new entity of cardiac arrhythmias distinct from CPVT."

The RyR (ryanodine receptor) mediates rapid Ca2+ efflux from the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and is responsible for triggering numerous Ca2+-activated physiological processes. The most studied RyR-mediated process is excitation-contraction coupling in striated muscle, where plasma membrane excitation is transmitted to the cell interior and results in Ca2+ efflux that triggers myocyte contraction. Recently, single-residue mutations in the cardiac RyR (RyR2) have been identified in families that exhibit CPVT (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia), a condition in which physical or emotional stress can trigger severe tachyarrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. The RyR2 mutations in CPVT are clustered in the N- and C-terminal domains, as well as in a central domain. Further, a critical signalling role for dysfunctional RyR2 has also been implicated in the generation of arrhythmias in the common condition of HF (heart failure). We have prepared cardiac RyR2 plasmids with various CPVT mutations to enable expression and analysis of Ca2+ release mediated by the wild-type and mutated RyR2. These studies suggest that the mutational locus may be important in the mechanism of Ca2+ channel dysfunction. Understanding the causes of aberrant Ca2+ release via RyR2 may assist in the development of effective treatments for the ventricular arrhythmias that often leads to sudden death in HF and in CPVT."

Mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) cause malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD), whereas mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) lead to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Most disease-associated RyR1 and RyR2 mutations are located in the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal regions of the corresponding ryanodine receptor (RyR) isoform. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations enhance the propensity for spontaneous Ca2+ release during store Ca2+ overload, a process known as store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR). Considering the similar locations of disease-associated RyR1 and RyR2 mutations in the RyR structure, we hypothesize that like CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations, MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations also enhance SOICR. To test this hypothesis, we determined the impact on SOICR of 12 MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations E2347-del, R2163H, G2434R, R2435L, R2435H, and R2454H located in the central region, and Y4796C, T4826I, L4838V, A4940T, G4943V, and P4973L located in the C-terminal region of the channel. We found that all these RyR1 mutations reduced the threshold for SOICR. Dantrolene, an acute treatment for MH, suppressed SOICR in HEK293 cells expressing the RyR1 mutants R164C, Y523S, R2136H, R2435H, and Y4796C. Interestingly, carvedilol, a commonly used \u03b2-blocker that suppresses RyR2-mediated SOICR, also inhibits SOICR in these RyR1 mutant HEK293 cells. Therefore, these results indicate that a reduced SOICR threshold is a common defect of MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations, and that carvedilol, like dantrolene, can suppress RyR1-mediated SOICR. Clinical studies of the effectiveness of carvedilol as a long-term treatment for MH/CCD or other RyR1-associated disorders may be warranted."

CPVT is an inherited disorder associated with mutations in either the RyR2 or a SR luminal protein, calsequestrin. RyR2 shows normal function at rest in CPVT but the RyR2 dysfunction is unmasked by physical exercise or emotional stress, suggesting abnormal RyR2 activation as an underlying mechanism. Several potential mechanisms have been advanced to explain the dysfunctional RyR2 observed in HF and CPVT, including enhanced RyR2 phosphorylation status, altered RyR2 regulation at luminal/cytoplasmic sites and perturbed RyR2 intra/inter-molecular interactions.

Objective Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a lethal inherited disease characterized by ventricular arrhythmias induced by physical exercise or emotional stress. The major cause of CPVT is mutations in RYR2, which encodes the cardiac ryanodine receptor channel. Recent advances in sequencing technology have yielded incidental findings of RYR2 variants in other cardiac diseases. Analyzing the characteristics of RYR2 variants related to CPVT will be useful for differentiation from those related to other cardiac diseases. We examined the phenotypic characteristics of patients with RYR2 variants. Methods Seventy-nine probands carrying RYR2 variants whose diagnoses were either CPVT (n=68) or long QT syndrome (LQTS; n=11) were enrolled. We compared the characteristics of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the location of the RYR2 mutations-N-terminal (NT), central region (CR) or C-terminal (CT)-between the two patient groups. Results Using the ECGs available from 53 probands before \u03b2-blocker therapies, we analyzed the heart rates (HRs). CPVT probands showed bradycardia more frequently (25/44; 57%) than LQTS probands (1/9; 11%; p=0.024). In CPVT patients, 20 mutations were located in NT, 25 in CR and 23 in CT. In LQTS patients, 5 mutations were located in NT, 2 in CR and 4 in CT. There were no significant differences in the locations of the RYR2 mutations between the phenotypes. Conclusion Bradycardia was highly correlated with the phenotype of CPVT. When a clinically-diagnosed LQTS patient with bradycardia carries an RYR2 mutation, we should be careful to avoid making a misdiagnosis, as the patient may actually have CPVT."

Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2 displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates. However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220 for coactivator recruitment, whereas VDR-directed activation by CRSP/Med occurs normally.

We now report the sequencing and characterization of ovine/caprine CRSP-1 and caprine CRSP-2. Mature ovine and caprine CRSP-1 are identical and have strong structural homology to CRSP-1s identified to date from other species.

The Vam7p PX domain has the same overall alpha/beta fold observed in the structures of the ligand-free p47(phox) PX domain and the PtdIns(3)P-bound p40(phox) PX domain, exhibiting several similarities and differences with these two PX domains. Most striking is the similarity between the Vam7p and p40(phox) PX domains in a subset of secondary structure elements despite the low level of sequence identity between them, suggesting that these elements form a conserved core in the PX domain fold. These similarities and the observation that a putative PtdIns(3)P binding site is already formed in the apo Vam7p PX domains suggest that ligand binding does not induce major conformational changes, contrary to what was previously thought.

(1991) Biochemistry 30, 6922-6929]. However, scFv F11 demonstrated only an approximately 4-fold decrease in the antigen-binding affinity (K(a) = 1.3 x 10(8) M(-)(1)) versus the parent F11 antibody. The scFv fragment F11 provides the first description of a functional protein trapped under physiological conditions in a partially structured state. This state is either close to the native one in the antigen-binding affinity or, alternatively, initial weak binding of the antigenic epitope induces folding of scFv F11 into a more structured conformation that generates relatively high affinity."

OBJECTIVE To amplify and express the gene encoding murine single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody against human cervical cancer and predict the secondary structure and three-dimensional structure of the antibody. METHODS The gene fragments coding for the variable region of the heavy and light chains of scFv antibody against human cervical cancer were amplified respectively using recombinant DNA techniques from CsA125 hybridoma cells, and spliced together using a flexible linker to the antibody. The scFv genes were then cloned into the expression vector pCANTAB 5E and expressed in E.coli HB2151 and TG1, respectively. The scFv antibody obtained was assayed using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis, with its secondary structure and three-dimensional structure predicted with Swiss-model and 3dpssm. The physicochemical properties of the antibody were analyzed with Antheprot software. RESULTS The expressed scFv antibody was soluble and phage-displayed. The specific binding capacity of the soluble and phage-displayed scFv antibody to the surface-associated antigen of human cervical cancer cell line were further confirmed. The scFv antibody had a relative molecular mass of 32,000 as was consistent to theoretical prediction, with pI of 7.215 and characterized to belong to alpha+beta protein. The antibody contained many protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and casein kinase II phosphorylation sites in both the VH and VL domains. Computer graphic modeling indicated that the linker was isolated from the VH and VL domains, which formed a hydrophobic pocket in the molecule to facilitate antigen binding. CONCLUSIONS The soluble and phage displayed scFv antibody expressed in E. coli against human cervical cancer shows high and specific affinity to the cervical cancer cell line surface-associated antigen. The construction and analysis of the molecular model of the antibody may facilitate further studies in engineering of the antibody and exploration of the mechanism of the antigen-antibody interaction."

As fold recognition benchmarks are often presented without any thought to the results that might be expected from a purely random set of predictions, an analysis of fold recognition baselines is long overdue. Given varying amounts of basic information about a protein-ranging from the length of the sequence to a knowledge of its secondary structure-to what extent can the fold be determined by intelligent guesswork? Can simple methods that make use of secondary structure information assign folds more accurately than purely random methods and could these methods be used to construct viable hierarchical classifications? EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED: A number of rapid automatic methods which score similarities between protein domains were devised and tested. These methods ranged from those that incorporated no secondary structure information, such as measuring absolute differences in sequence lengths, to more complex alignments of secondary structure elements. Each method was assessed for accuracy by comparison with the Class Architecture Topology Homology (CATH) classification. Methods were rated against both a random baseline fold assignment method as a lower control and FSSP as an upper control. Similarity trees were constructed in order to evaluate the accuracy of optimum methods at producing a classification of structure. RESULTS Using a rigorous comparison of methods with CATH, the random fold assignment method set a lower baseline of 11% true positives allowing for 3% false positives and FSSP set an upper benchmark of 47% true positives at 3% false positives. The optimum secondary structure alignment method used here achieved 27% true positives at 3% false positives. Using a less rigorous Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP)-like sensitivity measurement the random assignment achieved 6%, FSSP-59% and the optimum secondary structure alignment method-32%. Similarity trees produced by the optimum method illustrate that these methods cannot be used alone to produce a viable protein structural classification system. CONCLUSIONS Simple methods that use perfect secondary structure information to assign folds cannot produce an accurate protein taxonomy, however they do provide useful baselines for fold recognition. In terms of a typical CASP assessment our results suggest that approximately 6% of targets with folds in the databases could be assigned correctly by randomly guessing, and as many as 32% could be recognised by trivial secondary structure comparison methods, given knowledge of their correct secondary structures."

We investigated the influence of the macromolecular form of an epitope on the structure of antibody variable and constant regions expressed by the B cell population participating in an immune response to that epitope. Hybridomas were constructed from strain A/J mice undergoing either primary or secondary immune responses to p-azophenylarsonate conjugated to Brucella abortus (Ars-Bruc). We determined the sequences of the V genes expressed by hybridomas selected on the basis of expression of a single VH gene segment known to encode a large family of anti-Ars antibodies. These sequences were compared with the sequences of V genes expressed by a previously characterized panel of hybridomas isolated in the same way during the primary and secondary responses of A/J mice to Ars-KLH. The repertoire of Ars-specific V domains expressed among primary and secondary hybridomas elicited with these two forms of Ars were similar, as were the differences between primary and secondary V region somatic mutational alteration and affinity for Ars. In contrast, predominant expression of IgG2 anti-Ars antibodies was elicited in the secondary Ars-Bruc response, whereas secondary anti-Ars antibodies elicited with Ars-KLH are predominantly IgG1. Thus, differences in the macromolecular form of Ars clearly influence the isotypic profile of the anti-Ars response, but the expression, diversification, and selection of V domains elicited with this hapten are not greatly affected by such differences.

The AFS can be distinguished from the molten globule state by the formation of nonnative structure and, in particular, its high stability. In this study, the isolated domains of the MAK33 (murine monoclonal antibody of the subtype kappa/IgG1) Fab fragment were investigated under conditions that have been reported to induce the AFS. Surprising differences in the ability of individual domains to form the AFS were observed, despite the similarities in their native structures. All Fab domains were able to adopt the AFS, but only for V(H) (variable domain of the heavy chain) could a significant amount of tertiary structure be detected and different conditions were needed to induce the AFS. V(H), the least stable of the domains under physiological conditions, was the most stable in the AFS, yet all domains showed significant stability against thermal and chemical unfolding in their AFS. Formation of the AFS was found to generally proceed via the unfolded state, with similar rates for most of the domains. Taken together, our data reveal striking differences in the biophysical properties of the AFS of individual antibody domains that reflect the variation possible for domains of highly homologous native structures. Furthermore, they allow individual domain contributions to be dissected from specific oligomer effects in the AFS of the antibody Fab fragment."

The cohesin protein complex contributes to transcriptional regulation in a CTCF-independent manner by colocalizing with master regulators at tissue-specific loci. The regulation of transcription involves the concerted action of multiple transcription factors (TFs) and cohesin's role in this context of combinatorial TF binding remains unexplored. To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver. We observe a positive correlation between the number of distinct TFs bound and the presence of CNC sites. In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes. We also show that cohesin presence partially explains the commonly observed discrepancy between TF motif score and ChIP signal. Evidence from these statistical analyses in wild-type cells, and comparisons to maps of TF binding in Rad21-cohesin haploinsufficient mouse liver, suggests that cohesin helps to stabilize large protein-DNA complexes. Finally, we observe that the presence of mirrored CTCF binding events at promoters and their nearby cohesin-bound enhancers is associated with elevated expression levels."

Contraction of the large Igh and Igkappa loci brings all V genes, spanning >2.5 Mb in each locus, in proximity to DJ(H) or J(kappa) genes. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression by long-range chromosomal looping. We therefore hypothesized that CTCF may be crucial for the contraction of the Ig loci, but no CTCF sites have been described in any V loci. Using ChIP-chip, we demonstrated many CTCF sites in the V(H) and V(kappa) regions. However, CTCF enrichment in the Igh locus, but not the Igkappa locus, was largely unchanged throughout differentiation, suggesting that CTCF binding alone cannot be responsible for stage-specific looping. Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci. The differential binding of cohesin to CTCF sites may promote multiple loop formation and thus effective V(D)J recombination."

The cohesin protein complex holds sister chromatids in dividing cells together and is essential for chromosome segregation. Recently, cohesin has been implicated in mediating transcriptional insulation, via its interactions with CTCF. Here, we show in different cell types that cohesin functionally behaves as a tissue-specific transcriptional regulator, independent of CTCF binding. By performing matched genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-seq) in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), we discovered thousands of genomic sites that share cohesin and estrogen receptor alpha (ER) yet lack CTCF binding. By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, estrogen-regulated genes are preferentially bound by both ER and cohesin, and functionally, the silencing of cohesin caused aberrant re-entry of breast cancer cells into cell cycle after hormone treatment. We combined chromosomal interaction data in MCF-7 cells with our cohesin binding data to show that cohesin is highly enriched at ER-bound regions that capture inter-chromosomal loop anchors. Together, our data show that cohesin cobinds across the genome with transcription factors independently of CTCF, plays a functional role in estrogen-regulated transcription, and may help to mediate tissue-specific transcriptional responses via long-range chromosomal interactions."

CTCF and the cohesin complex modify chromatin by binding to DNA and interacting with each other and with other cellular proteins. Both proteins regulate transcription by a variety of local effects on transcription and by long-range topological effects. CTCF and cohesin also bind to herpesvirus genomes at specific sites and regulate viral transcription during latent and lytic cycles of replication. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) transcription is regulated by CTCF and cohesin, with both proteins previously reported to act as restrictive factors for lytic cycle transcription and virion production. In this study, we examined the interdependence of CTCF and cohesin binding to the KSHV genome. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses revealed that cohesin binding to the KSHV genome is highly CTCF dependent, whereas CTCF binding does not require cohesin. Furthermore, depletion of CTCF leads to the almost complete dissociation of cohesin from sites at which they colocalize. Thus, previous studies that examined the effects of CTCF depletion actually represent the concomitant depletion of both CTCF and cohesin components. Analysis of the effects of single and combined depletion indicates that CTCF primarily activates KSHV lytic transcription, whereas cohesin has primarily inhibitory effects. Furthermore, CTCF or cohesin depletion was found to have regulatory effects on cellular gene expression relevant for the control of viral infection, with both proteins potentially facilitating the expression of multiple genes important in the innate immune response to viruses. Thus, CTCF and cohesin have both positive and negative effects on KSHV lytic replication as well as effects on the host cell that enhance antiviral defenses.IMPORTANCE Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is causally linked to Kaposi's sarcoma and several lymphoproliferative diseases. KSHV, like other herpesviruses, intermittently reactivates from latency and enters a lytic cycle in which numerous lytic mRNAs and proteins are produced, culminating in infectious virion production. These lytic proteins may also contribute to tumorigenesis. Reactivation from latency is controlled by processes that restrict or activate the transcription of KSHV lytic genes. KSHV gene expression is modulated by binding of the host cell proteins CTCF and cohesin complex to the KSHV genome. These proteins bind to and modulate the conformation of chromatin, thereby regulating transcription. We have analyzed the interdependence of binding of CTCF and cohesin and demonstrate that while CTCF is required for cohesin binding to KSHV, they have very distinct effects, with cohesin primarily restricting KSHV lytic transcription. Furthermore, we show that cohesin and CTCF also exert effects on the host cell that promote antiviral defenses."

However, the N terminus of CTCF fused to artificial zinc fingers was not sufficient to redirect cohesin to non-CTCF binding sites, indicating a lack of an autonomously functioning domain in CTCF responsible for cohesin positioning.

Pharmacophore models are three-dimensional arrangements of molecular features required for biological activity that are used in ligand identification efforts for many biological targets, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Though GPCR are integral membrane proteins of considerable interest as targets for drug development, many of these receptors lack known ligands or experimentally determined structures necessary for ligand- or structure-based pharmacophore model generation, respectively. Thus, we here present a structure-based pharmacophore modeling approach that uses fragments placed with Multiple Copy Simultaneous Search (MCSS) to generate high-performing pharmacophore models in the context of experimentally determined, as well as modeled GPCR structures. Moreover, we have addressed the oft-neglected topic of pharmacophore model selection via development of a cluster-then-predict machine learning workflow. Herein score-based pharmacophore models were generated in experimentally determined and modeled structures of 13 class A GPCR and resulted in pharmacophore models exhibiting high enrichment factors when used to search a database containing 569 class A GPCR ligands. In addition, classification of pharmacophore models with the best performing cluster-then-predict logistic regression classifier resulted in positive predictive values (PPV) of 0.88 and 0.76 for selecting high enrichment pharmacophore models from among those generated in experimentally determined and modeled structures, respectively."

Since chemical features in a pharmacophore model are well known and highly transparent for medicinal chemists, these models are intuitively understandable and have been increasingly successful in computational drug discovery in the past few years. The performance and applicability of pharmacophore modeling depends on two main factors: the definition and placement of pharmacophoric features and the alignment techniques used to overlay 3D pharmacophore models and small molecules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD GABA(A) ion channel is a validated drug target, implicated in the pathophysiology of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Structural investigations on GABA(A) are currently precluded in the absence of experimentally resolved structure. Pharmacophore modeling circumvents such issues and proves to be a powerful and successful method in drug discovery. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW The present reviews encompass pharmacophoric models available in the literature for the orthosteric GABA and the allosteric benzodiazepine binding site. Success stories from these simplistic pharmacophore models in scaffold hopping and strategic lead optimization have been highlighted. Recent advances in pharmacophore modeling that can leverage CNS drug discovery programs and deliver astounding results have been reviewed. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN Readers are bound to gain a comprehensive insight on different computational techniques used by different groups to arrive at simple, yet sophisticated pharmacophore models. In the absence of experimentally unresolved active site geometry of GABA(A), these models will provide the reader an opportunity to translate these pharmacophoric features to the microscopic phenomenon of supramolecular ligand interaction. TAKE HOME MESSAGE Pharmacophore modeling has now evolved as a mainstay approach for lead generation and optimization in drug discovery programs. Of late, many advances in pharmacophore perception have emerged. Such advancements should be used to confront activity profiling and early stage risk assessment in a high-throughput fashion. Extending such technologies has the potential not only to reduce time and cost, but also to prevent late stage attrition in drug discovery."

One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article. Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.\u03b1-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed. The models reported by various scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to visually demonstrate their similarities and differences. The models developed by different researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different sets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a single model with good predictive values. One of the main reasons for this challenge is related to relatively large size of the active sites and flexibility of the CYP isoenzymes, which results in multiple binding sites. We propose development of multiple- diverse pharmacophore models for each binding mode (as opposed to a single predictive model for each CYP isoenzyme). After scoring and prioritization of the models, we propose the use of a battery of pharmacophore models for each CYP isoenzyme binding mode to computationally obtain a P450 interaction profile for drug candidates early in the drug development cycle, when decisions on their fate can be made before incurring the costs of synthesis and testing."

Generation of reliable pharmacophore models is a key strategy in drug design. The quality of a pharmacophore model is known to depend on several factors, with the quality of the conformer sets used perhaps being one of the most important. The goal of this study was to compare different conformational analysis methods to determine if one was superior to the others for pharmacophore generation using Catalyst/HypoGen. The five methods selected were Catalyst/Fast, Catalyst/Best, Omega, Chem-X and MacroModel. Data sets for which Catalysts models had previously been published were selected using defined quality measures. Hypotheses were generated for each of the data sets and the performance of the different conformational analysis methods was compared using both quantitative (cost and correlation coefficients) and qualitative measures (by comparing the hypotheses in terms of the features present and their spatial relationships). Two main conclusions emerged from the study. First, it was not always possible to replicate the literature results. The reasons for these failures are explored in detail, and a template for use in publications that apply the Catalyst methodology is proposed. Second, the faster rule-based methods for conformational analysis give pharmacophore models that are just as good as, and in some cases better than, the models generated using the slower, more rigorous approaches."

We present a new approach that incorporates flexibility based on extensive MD simulations of protein-ligand complexes into structure-based pharmacophore modeling and virtual screening. The approach uses the multiple coordinate sets saved during the MD simulations and generates for each frame a pharmacophore model. Pharmacophore models with the same pharmacophore features are pooled. In this way the high number of pharmacophore models that results from the MD simulation is reduced to only a few hundred representative pharmacophore models. Virtual screening runs are performed with every representative pharmacophore model; the screening results are combined and rescored to generate a single hit-list. The score for a particular molecule is calculated based on the number of representative pharmacophore models which classified it as active. Hence, the method is called common hits approach (CHA). The steps between the MD simulation and the final hit-list are performed automatically and without user interaction. We test the performance of CHA for virtual screening using screening databases with active and inactive compounds for 40 protein-ligand systems. The results of the CHA are compared to the (i) median screening performance of all representative pharmacophore models of protein-ligand systems, as well as to the virtual screening performance of (ii) a random classifier, (iii) the pharmacophore model derived from the experimental structure in the PDB, and (iv) the representative pharmacophore model appearing most frequently during the MD simulation. For the 34 (out of 40) protein-ligand complexes, for which at least one of the approaches was able to perform better than a random classifier, the highest enrichment was achieved using CHA in 68% of the cases, compared to 12% for the PDB pharmacophore model and 20% for the representative pharmacophore model appearing most frequently.

This merged pharmacophore model contains all features that are present during the simulation and statistical information about the dynamics of the pharmacophore features. Based on the dynamics of the pharmacophore features we derive two distinctive feature patterns resulting in two different pharmacophore models for the analyzed system - the first model consists of features that are obtained from the PDB structure and the second uses two features that can only be derived from the molecular dynamics simulation.

PURPOSE Estrogen Receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) is a well-established therapeutic target for Estrogen Receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers. Both Selective Estrogen Receptor Degraders (SERD) and PROTAC ER degraders are synthetic compounds suppressing the ER activity through the degradation of ER. However, the differences between SERD and PROTAC ER degraders are far from clear. METHODS The effect of PROTAC ER degrader ERD-148 and SERD fulvestrant on protein degradation was evaluated by western blot analysis. The cell proliferation was tested by WST-8 assays and the gene expressions were assessed by gene microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis after the compound treatment. RESULTS ERD-148 is a potent and selective PROTAC ER\u03b1 degrader. It degrades not only unphosphorylated ER\u03b1 but also the phosphorylated ER\u03b1 in the cells. In contrast, the SERD fulvestrant showed much-reduced degradation potency on the phosphorylated ER\u03b1. The more complete degradation of ER\u03b1 by ERD-148 translates into a greater maximum cell growth inhibition. However, ERD-148 and fulvestrant share a similar gene regulation profile except for the variation of regulation potency. Further studies indicate that ERD-148 degrades the ER\u03b1 in fulvestrant-resistant cells. CONCLUSION PROTAC ER degrader has a different mechanism of action compared to SERD which may be used in treating fulvestrant-resistant cancers."

Endocrine therapy (ET) targeting estrogen receptor (ER) signaling is still the mainstay treatment option for early or advanced ER-positive breast cancer (BC) and may involve suppressing estrogen production by means of aromatase inhibitors or directly blocking the ER pathway through selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen or selective estrogen receptor degraders such as fulvestrant. However, despite the availability of this armamentarium in clinical practice, de novo or acquired resistance to ET is the main cause of endocrine-based treatment failure leading to the progression of the BC. Recent advances in targeting, modulating, and degrading ERs have led to the development of new drugs capable of overcoming intrinsic or acquired ET resistance related to alterations in the ESR1 gene. The new oral selective estrogen receptor degraders, which are capable of reducing ER protein expression and blocking estrogen-dependent and -independent ER signaling, have a broader spectrum of activity against ESR1 mutations and seem to be a promising means of overcoming the failure of standard ET. The aim of this review is to summarize the development of oral selective estrogen receptor degraders, their current status, and their future perspectives."

INTRODUCTION The selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) and full receptor antagonist provides an important therapeutic option for hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. Endocrine therapies include tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), that exhibits receptor agonist and antagonist activity, and aromatase inhibitors that block estrogen biosynthesis but which demonstrate acquired resistance. Fulvestrant, the only currently approved SERD, is limited by poor drug-like properties. A key focus for improving disease management has been development of oral SERDs with optimized target occupancy and potency and superior clinical efficacy. AREAS COVERED Using PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, and congress websites, this review explored the preclinical development and clinical pharmacokinetics from early phase clinical studies (2015 or later) of novel oral SERDs, including giredestrant, amcenestrant, camizestrant, elacestrant, and rintodestrant. EXPERT OPINION Numerous oral SERDs are in clinical development, aiming to form the core endocrine therapy for HR-positive breast cancer. Through property- and structure-based drug design of estrogen receptor-binding, antagonism, degradation, anti-proliferation, and pharmacokinetic properties, these SERDs have distinct profiles which impact clinical dosing, efficacy, and safety.

However, in vivo, positron emission tomography scanning studies show that the compound displaces the selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, raclopride. We have evaluated, in this study, the effect of (-)-OSU6162, on L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesias in a primate model of Parkinson's disease. Five 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated cynomolgus monkeys with a stable parkinsonian syndrome and reproducible dyskinesias to L-DOPA were used in this study. The monkeys were housed in observation cages equipped with an electronic motility monitoring system. They were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with L-DOPA methyl ester (125 mg per animal) plus benserazide (50 mg per animal; L-DOPA/benserazide) alone or in combination with (-)-OSU6162 (1.0, 3.0, 6.0 or 10 mg/kg, s.c.). Subcutaneous injection of sterile saline was used as control. L-DOPA/benserazide increased locomotion and improved parkinsonism but also induced dyskinesias. Co-administration of (-)-OSU6162 with L-DOPA/benserazide produced a significant reduction in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. This improvement in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias occurred mainly at the onset of the L-DOPA/benserazide effect as reflected by an increase in the duration of the \"ON\" state without dyskinesias up to 3.4 fold after (-)-OSU6162 co-administration as compared to L-DOPA/benserazide alone. The anti-dyskinetic effect of (-)-OSU6162 was maintained during 14 days and no tolerance to this effect was observed. Our data suggests that (-)-OSU6162 could be of significant clinical value to reduce L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in fluctuating advanced Parkinson's disease patients."

The pathophysiology of L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias (LID), a common problem after long-term use of L-dopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), is not completely understood. Oscillations in L-Dopa concentrations in the brain are believed to be responsible, at least in part, for their pathogenesis. This study was aimed at verifying whether chronic administration of cabergoline, a long-acting dopamine D2-like receptor agonist, can reverse established LID. Four MPTP-treated cynomolgus monkeys with long-standing and stable parkinsonian syndrome and reproducible dyskinesias to L-Dopa, were used in this study. We compared the antiparkinsonian and dyskinetic responses of L-Dopa methyl ester (62.5 mg and 125 mg), given with benserazide (50 mg) (L-Dopa/benserazide), administered before and after a 6-week period during which the animals were treated only by daily administration of cabergoline (doses ranging from 0.125 to 0.185 mg/kg, subcutaneous). During cabergoline treatment, the monkeys initially showed marked dyskinesias, which were reduced significantly after 4 weeks of treatment. However, there was no tolerance to its antiparkinsonian effect. L-Dopa/benserazide given 4 days after cabergoline withdrawal produced a significant antiparkinsonian effect, but dyskinesias were dramatically reduced compared to what had been seen before chronic cabergoline treatment. The duration of the L-Dopa response was not increased after chronic administration of cabergoline. Our data suggest that sustained dopamine D2 receptor stimulation could be of value when trying to reduce or to reverse LID in patients with fluctuating advanced PD."

Loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in the midbrain causes Parkinson's disease. L-DOPA, the precursor to the neurotransmitters dopamine, crosses vast majority of physiological and biochemical barriers that dopamine cannot. But most levodopa is decarboxylated to dopamine before it reaches the brain. This causes to little therapeutic gain with strong peripheral side effects. Benserazide is an irreversible inhibitor of peripheral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase that prevents the breakdown of levodopa in the bloodstream. The challenges are to increase the therapeutic efficiency, the bioavailability and decreasing the unfavourable side effects of Levodopa drug. Biocompatible nano-sized drug carriers could address these challenges at molecular level. Thus calculations of drug loading ability of acid-functionalized CNT for the benserazide as a nanodug carrier complex for L-DOPA were performed. In this regard, evaluation of all adsorption features of the most stable conformer of benserazide molecule onto carboxylated carbon nanotube is critical. To determine the minimum energy conformer of benserazide, the molecular structure and conformational analysis of 512 possible conformers have been subjected to first principle quantum mechanical calculations. Our work established a novel and easy-to-make formulation of benserazide/carboxylated CNT conjugate with extremely high drug loading efficiency of Levodopa for Parkinson disease treatment."

BACKGROUND Chronic treatment with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) is often associated with motor side effects in PD patients. The search for new therapeutic approaches has led to study the role of other neuromodulators including adenosine. Among the four adenosine receptors characterized so far, the A2A subtype is distinctively present on striatopallidal output neurons containing enkephalin and mainly bearing dopamine (DA) D2 receptors (indirect pathway). Studies in DA-denervated rats suggest that blockade of adenosine A2A receptors might be used in PD. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the antiparkinsonian effect of a new selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, KW-6002, in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys. METHODS In the present study, we used six MPTP-exposed cynomolgus monkeys already primed and exhibiting L-dopa-induced dyskinesias to evaluate both the antiparkinsonian and dyskinetic effect upon challenge with two oral doses (60 and 90 mg/kg) of KW-6002 administered alone or in combination with L-dopa/benserazide (50/12.5 mg). RESULTS KW-6002 administered alone produced a dose-dependent antiparkinsonian response that reached the level of efficacy of L-dopa/benserazide but was less likely to reproduce dyskinesias in these animals. When co-administered, KW-6002 potentiated the effects of L-dopa/benserazide on motor activity (up to 30%) without affecting the dyskinetic response. CONCLUSION Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists have antiparkinsonian effects of their own with a reduced propensity to elicit dyskinesias. They might therefore be useful agents in the treatment of PD."

Thirty minutes after the first administration, animals treated with L-DOPA, L-DOPA+benserazide, and nano-DOPA showed equally significant (p<0.05) improvements in coordination performance in comparison to the non-treated group. After 4 weeks of treatment, coordination performance in the nano-DOPA group (89\u00b113% of the intact control level) was twice as high as in the L-DOPA and L-DOPA+benserazide groups, which did not differ from non-treated animals.

The enhanced response was not due to an intrinsic effect of benserazide. Nor was it dependent on a change in central dopamine (DA) receptor sensitivity, because the two pretreatment groups (L-DOPA-A and vehicle) did not differ in their locomotor response to a range of apomorphine doses (300--3,000 micrograms/kg, IP).

Moreover, the enhanced response to L-DOPA-B chf L-DOPA alone (without benserazide) (1,200 mg/kg, orally). Animals which had been pretreated with L-DOPA-B had significantly higher brain levels of L-DOPA and DA after a subsequent challenge dose of L-DOPA-B administered 24 h later.

BACKGROUND Porphyromonas gingivalis produces outer membrane-attached proteins that include the virulence-associated cysteine proteinases RgpA and RgpB (Arg-gingipains) and Kgp (Lys-gingipain). The gingipains provide P. gingivalis with a general proteolytic tool for degradation of proteinaceous nutrients for growth. They are also essential for the processing and maturation of the major fimbriae (FimA) which are important in facilitating bacterial adhesion to host tissues. FimA has been characterized as an important virulence factor for P. gingivalis, and many studies, both animal experiments and clinical investigations, have characterized fimA genotypes II, Ib, and IV to be associated with disease (periodontitis and cardiovascular disease) while genotypes I, III, and V represent avirulent strains. The relationship between virulence and gene variation of the rgpB gene has not been investigated extensively. However, nucleotide variations of the rgpB gene result in four amino acid substitutions in the catalytic domain identifying five different rgpB genotypes. They are named according to the different amino acid sequences in the primary protein structure of RGPB and named NYPN, NSSN, NSSK, NYPK, and DYPN (Beikler et al. 2005). AIM The aim of the present study is to elucidate a possible relationship between fimA virulent and avirulent genotypes to the corresponding rgpB genotypes. METHODS The total length of the rgpB (2212 bp) and fimA genes (1140 bp) from 20 clinical isolates was sequenced. Primers for pcr and sequencing of the genes were selected according to earlier investigations. RESULTS The rgpB genotypes, NSSN and NYPN (n=2 and 6, respectively), were detected in the fimA II genotypes of P. gingivalis, while NSSK was detected in one fimA Ib genotype in the population. For the eight fimA IV genotypes, five NSSK and three NSSN rgpB genotypes were detected. In two fima I genotypes were detected one DYPN and one NYPN of the rgpB variants, while one fimA III genotype was associated with NSSK. CONCLUSION The rgpB genotypes NSSN, NYPN, NSSK of P. gingivalis may be associated with the virulent fimA genotypes II, Ib and IV, indicating a possible connection to their virulent properties."

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the prevalence of P. gingivalis-specific fimA genotypes and periodontal health status in Chinese adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS One-hundred and fifteen patients with chronic periodontitis and 136 periodontally healthy adults were selected. P. gingivalis detection, determination of fimA genotypes, and the co-existence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Tannerella forsythia with various fimA types, were assessed by the polymerase chain reaction. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for associating the fimA-specific genes with periodontitis. RESULTS P. gingivalis was detected in 22.1% of healthy subjects and in 81.7% of the patients. A single fimA genotype was detected in most samples. In healthy adults, the most prevalent fimA genotype was type I (66.7%). However, type II was detected most frequently (43.6%) in the patient group, followed by type IV (30.9%). The frequency of co-existing A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. forsythia was highest in type II fimA-positive sites. Statistical analysis revealed that periodontitis was associated with occurrences of type I (odds ratio 0.97), Ib (odds ratio 13.26), II (odds ratio 36.62), III (odds ratio 4.57), IV (odds ratio 22.86) and V (odds ratio 1.19).

We also analyzed the relationship between fimbrial genotypes and clinical parameters of periodontitis recorded at the first medical examination. RESULTS Both fimbrial types could be detected in 63 out of 100 samples; among them, fimA genotype II was found in 33 samples (52.4%), in which the mfa genotype was 1.75 times more prevalent than mfa .

BACKGROUND Although most adults are infected by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), some patients develop highly lethal diseases associated with EBV infection, including EBV-hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH), chronic active EBV infections (CAEBV), and lymphoma, the pathogeneses of which remain to be investigated. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex may be associated with the viral infection pathway, and, therefore, HLA alleles may be associated with EBV-related diseases and subpopulations of infected cells, studies related to EBV-associated diseases, and subpopulations of infected cells that were conducted in China are scarce. METHODS In this study, we analyzed the high-resolution HLA genotypes of 269 patients with EBV-associated diseases and 213 EBV-seronegative hematopoietic stem cell donors using PCR-SBT assay and elucidated the associations of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 alleles with EBV-associated diseases in the Chinese population, Benjamini-Hochberg correction to adjust for multiple testing. HLA genotypes were also analyzed in patients with EBV-associated diseases showing EBV-infected lymphocyte subpopulations. RESULTS We found that individuals carrying the following alleles showed the following levels of risks: HLA-DRB1*11 allele, reduced risk of EBV-related disease (OR [odds ratio]: 0.56; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.32-0.99; p < .05; Adjust p = .71); HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele, reduced risk (OR: 0.5699; 95% CI: 0.3486-0.9317; p < .05; Adjust p = .57); and HLA-B*15:01 allele, increased risk (OR: 1.763; 95% CI: 0.3486-0.9317; p < .05; Adjust p = .57). Patients with EBV-associated diseases showing the B*15:01 genotype had a higher risk of T-cell, NK-cell, and multicell infections than those with other genotype subgroups. CONCLUSIONS These findings highlight the importance of HLA genotype for assessing EBV infectivity."

BACKGROUND Viliuisk encephalomyelitis is a disorder that starts, in most cases, as an acute meningoencephalitis. Survivors of the acute phase develop a slowly progressing neurologic syndrome characterized by dementia, dysarthria, and spasticity. An epidemic of this disease has been spreading throughout the Yakut Republic of the Russian Federation. Although clinical, neuropathologic, and epidemiologic data suggest infectious etiology, multiple attempts at pathogen isolation have been unsuccessful. METHODS Detailed clinical, pathologic, laboratory, and epidemiologic studies have identified 414 patients with definite Viliuisk encephalomyelitis in 15 of 33 administrative regions of the Yakut Republic between 1940 and 1999. All data are documented in a Registry. RESULTS The average annual Viliuisk encephalomyelitis incidence rate at the height of the epidemic reached 8.8 per 100,000 population and affected predominantly young adults. The initial outbreak occurred in a remote isolated area of the middle reaches of Viliui River; the disease spread to adjacent areas and further in the direction of more densely populated regions. The results suggest that intensified human migration from endemic villages led to the emergence of this disease in new communities. Recent social and demographic changes have presumably contributed to a subsequent decline in disease incidence. CONCLUSIONS Based on the largest known set of diagnostically verified Viliuisk encephalomyelitis cases, we demonstrate how a previously little-known disease that was endemic in a small indigenous population subsequently reached densely populated areas and produced an epidemic involving hundreds of persons."

Since the discovery of Viliuisk encephalomyelitis (VE) in 1887, scientists have tried to understand the natural history and aetiology of this endemic neurological disorder among the native Sakha population of Central Siberia. Familial aggregation and segregation analysis suggested a genetic influence on VE incidence. However, recent studies have implicated an unknown virus, possibly from the alpha herpesvirus family, as a possible cause for this disease. As VE is a neurological disease characterized by the inflammatory reactions systematically observed in the spinocerebellar fluid and in the brain tissue of deceased patients, we examined 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across seven inflammation-related candidate gene regions, including chemokine receptors type 2 and 5 (CCR2/CCR5), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-10, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF) and chemokine regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES). Our main objective was to analyse the degree of genetic association between VE and candidate genes that have been previously implicated in other inflammatory diseases. Samples were collected from 83 affected families comprising 88 verified VE cases, 156 family members, and an additional 69 unrelated, unaffected inhabitants of the same geographical area. This collection included substantially all of the cases that are currently on the VE Registry. The experimental design included both case-control and transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT)-based familial association analyses. None of 17 SNPs analysed was significantly associated with VE occurrence. Exclusion of these eight genes based on the lack of association has important implications for identifying the disease agent, as well as prescribing therapy and understanding Viliuisk encephalomyelitis."

Death occurs within 3 to 6 months in subacute cases and within 6 years in the slowly progressive cases. Chronic cases lack a subacute phase but show a slowly progressive dementia associated with bradykinesia, dysarthria and spastic paraparesis that stabilizes late in the disease process. In subacute and slowly progressive cases, focal necrotizing encephalomyelitis is seen at necropsy. Chronic cases show multifocal areas of lysis with a gliotic margin, predominantly within grey matter, lacking associated chronic inflammatory changes seen in the other forms of the disease. Epidemiological studies are consistent with a disease of low-grade communicability, but laboratory studies have so far failed to reveal an infectious organism.

METHODS AND RESULTS In order to address the current gap in the knowledge of potential underlying pathophysiology, a retrospective case-control study of polysomnographic recordings of patients presenting to a tertiary sleep disorders clinic with exploding head syndrome was conducted. Interictal (non-attack associated) electroencephalographic biomarkers were investigated by performing macrostructural and event-related dynamic spectral analyses of the whole-night EEG. In patients with exploding head syndrome, additional oscillatory activity was recorded during wakefulness and at sleep/wake periods. This activity differed in its frequency, topography and source from the alpha rhythm that it accompanied. CONCLUSION Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesise that at times of sleep-wake transition in patients with exploding head syndrome, aberrant attentional processing may lead to amplification and modulation of external sensory stimuli."

Using two independent samples, we examine sleep and well-being variables associated with exploding head syndrome. We focused on insomnia symptoms, life stress, anxiety and depression symptoms, and sleep experiences such as sleep paralysis as potential factors associated with exploding head syndrome. Study 1 consisted of 199 female undergraduate students. We found a lifetime prevalence of 37.19%, with 6.54% experiencing at least one episode a month. All variables were associated with exploding head syndrome in univariate analyses, but only insomnia symptoms and sleep paralysis frequency were significantly associated with exploding head syndrome in multiple logistic regression models. Study 2 was an international sample of 1683 participants (age range 18-82, 53.00% female). Lifetime prevalence was 29.59%, with monthly episodes occurring in 3.89% of participants.

Histone lysine methyltransferase SUV420H1, which is responsible for site-specific di-/tri-methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20), has crucial roles in DNA-templated processes, including DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and chromatin compaction. Its mutations frequently occur in human cancers. Nucleosomes containing the histone variant H2A.Z enhance the catalytic activities of SUV420H1 on H4K20 di-methylation deposition, regulating early replication origins. However, the molecular mechanism by which SUV420H1 specifically recognizes and deposits H4K20 methyl marks on nucleosomes remains poorly understood. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of SUV420H1 associated with H2A-containing nucleosome core particles (NCPs), and H2A.Z-containing NCPs. We find that SUV420H1 makes extensive site-specific contacts with histone and DNA regions. SUV420H1 C-terminal domain recognizes the H2A-H2B acidic patch of NCPs through its two arginine anchors, thus enabling H4K20 insertion for catalysis specifically. We also identify important residues increasing the catalytic activities of SUV420H1 bound to H2A.Z NCPs. In vitro and in vivo functional analyses reveal that multiple disease-associated mutations at the interfaces are essential for its catalytic activity and chromatin state regulation. Together, our study provides molecular insights into the nucleosome-based recognition and methylation mechanisms of SUV420H1, and a structural basis for understanding SUV420H1-related human disease."

Among other targets, the protein lysine methyltransferase PR-Set7 induces histone H4 lysine 20 monomethylation (H4K20me1), which is the substrate for further methylation by the Suv4-20h methyltransferase. Although these enzymes have been implicated in control of replication origins, the specific contribution of H4K20 methylation to DNA replication remains unclear. Here, we show that H4K20 mutation in mammalian cells, unlike in Drosophila, partially impairs S-phase progression and protects from DNA re-replication induced by stabilization of PR-Set7. Using Epstein-Barr virus-derived episomes, we further demonstrate that conversion of H4K20me1 to higher H4K20me2/3 states by Suv4-20h is not sufficient to define an efficient origin per se, but rather serves as an enhancer for MCM2-7 helicase loading and replication activation at defined origins. Consistent with this, we find that Suv4-20h-mediated H4K20 tri-methylation (H4K20me3) is required to sustain the licensing and activity of a subset of ORCA/LRWD1-associated origins, which ensure proper replication timing of late-replicating heterochromatin domains. Altogether, these results reveal Suv4-20h-mediated H4K20 tri-methylation as a critical determinant in the selection of active replication initiation sites in heterochromatin regions of mammalian genomes."

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains."

PR-Set7 is the sole monomethyltransferase responsible for H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) that is the substrate for further methylation by Suv4-20h1/h2. PR-Set7 is required for proper cell cycle progression and is subject to degradation by the CRL4(Cdt2) ubiquitin ligase complex as a function of the cell cycle and DNA damage. This report demonstrates that PR-Set7 is an important downstream effector of CRL4(Cdt2) function during origin of DNA replication licensing, dependent on Suv4-20h1/2 activity. Aberrant rereplication correlates with decreased levels of H4K20me1 and increased levels of H4K20 trimethylation (H4K20me3). Expression of a degradation-resistant PR-Set7 mutant in the mouse embryo that is normally devoid of Suv4-20 does not compromise development or cell cycle progression unless Suv4-20h is coexpressed. PR-Set7 targeting to an artificial locus results in recruitment of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in a manner dependent on Suv4-20h and H4K20me3. Consistent with this, H4K20 methylation status plays a direct role in recruiting ORC through the binding properties of ORC1 and ORCA/LRWD1. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes."

Maintenance of genomic integrity is essential to ensure normal organismal development and to prevent diseases such as cancer. Nuclear DNA is packaged into chromatin, and thus genome maintenance can be influenced by distinct chromatin environments. In particular, post-translational modifications of histones have emerged as key regulators of genomic integrity. Intense research during the past few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20 methylation states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses monomethylation of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes mediate further H4K20 methylation to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance. In this review, we explain molecular mechanisms underlying these defects and discuss novel ideas for furthering our understanding of genome maintenance in higher eukaryotes."

Here, we examined MCM hexamer states during the cell cycle in human hTERT-RPE1 cells using multicolor immunofluorescence-based, single-cell plot analysis, and biochemical size fractionation. Experiments involving cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase and release from the arrest revealed that a double MCM hexamer was formed via a single hexamer during G1 progression. A single MCM hexamer was recruited to chromatin in the early G1 phase. Another single hexamer was recruited to form a double hexamer in the late G1 phase. We further examined relationship between the MCM hexamer states and the methylation levels at lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20) and found that the double MCM hexamer state was correlated with di/trimethyl-H4K20 (H4K20me2/3). Inhibiting the conversion from monomethyl-H4K20 (H4K20me1) to H4K20me2/3 retained the cells in the single MCM hexamer state. Non-proliferative cells, including confluent cells or Cdk4/6 inhibitor-treated cells, also remained halted in the single MCM hexamer state.

DNA replication during cell division leads to dilution of histone modifications and can thus affect chromatin-mediated gene regulation, raising the question of how the cell-cycle shapes the histone modification landscape, particularly during embryogenesis. We tackled this problem by manipulating the cell cycle during early Xenopus laevis embryogenesis and analyzing in vivo histone H4K20 methylation kinetics. The global distribution of un-, mono-, di-, and tri-methylated histone H4K20 was measured by mass spectrometry in normal and cell-cycle-arrested embryos over time. Using multi-start maximum likelihood optimization and quantitative model selection, we found that three specific biological methylation rate constants were required to explain the measured H4K20 methylation state kinetics. While demethylation is essential for regulating H4K20 methylation kinetics in non-cycling cells, demethylation is very likely dispensable in rapidly dividing cells of early embryos, suggesting that cell-cycle-mediated dilution of H4K20 methylation is an essential regulatory component for shaping its epigenetic landscape during early development.

In order to correlate histone modifications and transcription-dependent histone turnover, we performed genome wide analyses for euchromatic regions in G2/M-arrested fission yeast. The results show that transcription-dependent histone turnover at 5' promoter and 3' termination regions is directly correlated with the occurrence of H3K56Ac and H4K20 mono-methylation (H4K20me1) in actively transcribed genes. Furthermore, the increase of H3K56Ac and H4K20me1 and antisense RNA production was observed in the absence of the histone H3K36 methyltransferase Set2 and histone deacetylase complex (HDAC) that are involved in the suppression of histone turnover within the coding regions.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the histone methylase Set1 is responsible for the transcription-dependent deposition of H3K4 methylation (H3K4me) throughout the genome. Here we show that a combination of a hypomorphic replication mutation (orc5-1) with the absence of Set1 (set1\u0394) compromises the progression through S-phase, and this is associated with a large increase in DNA damage. The ensuing DNA damage checkpoint activation, in addition to that of the spindle assembly checkpoint, restricts the growth of orc5-1 set1\u0394. The opposite effects of the lack of RNase H activity and the reduction of histone levels on orc5-1 set1\u0394 viability are in agreement with their expected effects on replication fork progression. We propose that the role of H3K4 methylation during DNA replication becomes critical when the replication forks acceleration due to decreased origin firing in the orc5-1 background increases the risk for transcription replication conflicts. Furthermore, we show that an increase of reactive oxygen species levels, likely a consequence of the elevated DNA damage, is partly responsible for the lethality in orc5-1 set1\u0394."

We therefore aimed to examine the procedural methods and early and late outcomes among patients undergoing distal LM trifurcation versus bifurcation PCI in the EXCEL trial. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with distal LM bifurcation disease randomised to PCI with everolimus-eluting stents in the EXCEL trial were categorised into those with and without trifurcation involvement. Angiographic and procedural characteristics in addition to clinical events up to five-year follow-up after PCI were compared. Among 605 patients with site-reported distal LM disease, 61 patients (10.1%) were identified with trifurcation anatomy. The five-year primary composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 16.6% of patients with trifurcation disease compared with 22.5% of patients with distal bifurcation disease only (p=0.32).

PATIENTS AND METHODS We compared baseline clinical and procedural characteristics and also determined how the relative treatment effect of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was different in EXCEL and NOBLE, compared with those of the multicenter, IRIS-MAIN registry (n=2481). The primary outcome for between-study comparison was a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke. RESULTS There were between-study differences in patient risk profiles (age, BMI, diabetes, and clinical presentation), lesion complexities, and procedural characteristics (stent type, the use of off-pump surgery, and radial artery); the proportion of diabetes and acute coronary syndrome was particularly lower in NOBLE than in other studies. Although there was interstudy heterogeneity for the protocol definition of MI, the risks for serious composite outcome of death, MI, or stroke were similar between PCI and CABG in EXCEL [hazard ratio (HR): 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79-1.26; P=0.98] and in the matched cohort of IRIS-MAIN (HR: 1.08; 95%CI: 0.85-1.38; P=0.53), whereas it was significantly higher after PCI than after CABG in NOBLE (HR: 1.47; 95%CI: 1.06-2.05; P=0.02), which was driven by more common MI and stroke after PCI.

The SSII provides the following treatment recommendations: (i) coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (equipoise risk), (ii) CABG preferred (excessive risk for PCI) or (iii) PCI preferred (excessive risk for CABG). We sought to externally validate SSII and to investigate the impact of not abiding by the SSII recommendations in the randomized EXCEL trial of PCI versus CABG for left main disease. METHODS The calibration plot of predicted versus observed 4-year mortality was constructed from individual values of SSII in EXCEL. To assess overestimation versus underestimation of predicted mortality risk, an optimal fit regression line with slope and intercept was determined. Prospective treatment recommendations based on SSII were compared with actual treatments and all-cause mortality at 4 years. RESULTS SSII variables were available from EXCEL trial in 1807/1905 (95%) patients. For the entire cohort, discrimination was possibly helpful (C statistic = 0.670). SSII-predicted all-cause mortality at 4 years overestimated the observed mortality, particularly in the highest-risk percentiles, as confirmed by the fit regression line [intercept 2.37 (1.51-3.24), P = 0.003; slope 0.67 (0.61-0.74), P < 0.001]. When the SSII-recommended treatment was CABG, randomized EXCEL patients treated with PCI had a trend towards higher mortality compared with those treated with CABG (14.1% vs 5.3%, P = 0.07) in the as-treat population. In the intention-to-treat population, patients randomized to PCI had higher mortality compared with those randomized to CABG (15.1% vs 4.1%, P = 0.02), when SSII recommended CABG. CONCLUSIONS In the EXCEL trial of patients with left main disease, the SSII-predicted 4-year mortality overestimated the 4-year observed mortality with a possibly helpful discrimination. Non-compliance with SSII CABG treatment recommendations (i.e. randomized to PCI) was associated with higher 4-year all-cause mortality."

Importance Patients with left main coronary artery disease have improved outcomes with coronary revascularization compared with medical therapy, but the choice of optimal revascularization technique is unresolved. Objective To use bayesian methods to analyze the risk differences for patients with left main coronary artery disease randomized to treatment with coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) compared with those randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Design, Setting, and Participants A systematic review using the PubMed database with the query string \"(left main disease) and (PCI or CABG) and (5-year follow-up) and (clinical trial)\" identified all RCTs from January 1996 to January 2020 comparing CABG to PCI for treatment of patients with left main coronary artery disease and with 5-year follow-up data. With the use of bayesian methods, the largest and most publicized RCT (EXCEL; Evaluation of XIENCE Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization; 2019) was reanalyzed (1) as an isolated entity using noninformative priors and (2) in the context of previous knowledge using informative priors derived from similar trials. Published aggregate data were used with assignments from each trial following the original intention-to-treat principle. Combining EXCEL data with varying levels of prior information using Bayes theorem provided final (posterior) probability distributions for primary and secondary outcomes. Main Outcomes and Measures A composite end point of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke was the primary EXCEL outcome and was accordingly the primary outcome for this reanalysis. Secondary analyses were performed for isolated all-cause mortality and for the composite outcome along with repeated revascularization procedures. Results When EXCEL data were analyzed using the originally stated noninferiority design, the 5-year primary outcome difference reported (2.8%; 95% CI, -0.9% to 6.5%) exceeded the predefined 4.2% noninferiority margin; thus, the null hypothesis of PCI inferiority could not be rejected. By contrast, the present bayesian analysis of the EXCEL primary outcome estimated 95% probability that the 5-year primary outcome difference was increased with PCI compared with CABG and 87% probability that this difference was greater than 1 extra event per 100 patients treated. Bayesian analyses also suggested 99% probability that EXCEL total mortality was increased with PCI and 94% probability that this absolute difference exceeded 1 extra deaths per 100 treated. A systematic review identified 3 other RCTs that studied the same question. The incorporation of this prior knowledge reduced the estimated probability of any excess mortality with PCI to 85%. For the secondary composite end point, which also included repeated revascularizations, there were estimated probabilities of 98% for at least 4 extra events and of 90% for at least 5 extra events per 100 patients treated with PCI. Conclusions and Relevance Bayesian analysis assisted in RCT data interpretation and specifically suggested, whether based on EXCEL results alone or on the totality of available evidence, that PCI was associated with inferior long-term results for all events, including mortality, compared with CABG for patients with left main coronary artery disease."

Whereas rates of death, stroke, and myocardial infarction were similar at 36 months, event timing and repeat revascularization rates differed by treatment group. OBJECTIVES To understand the effects of revascularization strategy from the patient's perspective, a prospective quality of life (QoL) substudy was performed alongside the EXCEL trial. METHODS Between September 2010 and March 2014, 1,905 patients with LMCAD were randomized to undergo CABG or PCI, of whom 1,788 participated in the QoL substudy. QoL was assessed at baseline and 1, 12, and 36 months using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, the Rose Dyspnea Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8, and the EQ-5D. Differences between PCI and CABG were assessed using longitudinal random-effect growth curve models. RESULTS Over 36 months, both PCI and CABG were associated with significant improvements in QoL compared with baseline. At 1 month, PCI was associated with better QoL than CABG. By 12 months though, these differences were largely attenuated, and by 36 months, there were no significant QoL differences between PCI and CABG. CONCLUSIONS Among selected patients with LMCAD, both PCI and CABG result in similar QoL improvement through 36 months, although a greater early benefit is seen with PCI. Taken together with the 3-year clinical results of EXCEL, these findings suggest that PCI and CABG provide similar intermediate-term outcomes for patients with LMCAD.

GPI use was infrequent (n = 67, 7.2%) and was not associated with adverse outcomes. CONCLUSION Among patients undergoing LMCA PCI in the EXCEL trial, procedural use of bivalirudin was associated with greater rates of periprocedural MI and the 30-day composite endpoint without reducing bleeding complications. Five-year outcomes were similar. GPIs were used infrequently and were not associated with clinical outcomes."

BACKGROUND Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been established as an alternative treatment option to coronary artery by-pass graft (CABG) surgery in patients with left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD). Whether the findings of randomized controlled trials are applicable to a real-world patient population is unclear. METHODS We compared the outcomes of PCI with new-generation DES in the all-comer, international, multicenter DELTA-2 registry retrospectively evaluating mid-term clinical outcomes with the historical CABG cohort enrolled in the DELTA-1 registry according to the EXCEL key inclusion or exclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at the median time of follow-up time of 501 days. The consistency of the effect of DELTA-2 PCI versus DELTA-1 CABG according to the EXCEL enrollment criteria was tested using propensity score-adjusted Cox regression models. RESULTS Out of 3986 patients enrolled in the DELTA-2 PCI registry, 2418 were EXCEL candidates and 1568 were not EXCEL candidates. The occurrence of the primary endpoint was higher among non-EXCEL candidates compared with EXCEL candidates (15.4% vs. 6.9%; hazard ratio 2.52; 95% confidence interval 2.00-3.16; p < 0.001). Among 901 patients enrolled in the historical DELTA-1 CABG cohort, 471 were EXCEL candidates and 430 were not EXCEL candidates. When comparing the DELTA-2 PCI with the DELTA-1 CABG cohort, the occurrence of the primary endpoint was lower in the PCI group compared with the historical CABG cohort among EXCEL candidates (6.9% vs. 10.7%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.92), while no significant difference was observed among non-EXCEL candidates (15.4% vs. 12.5%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.94; 95% confidence interval: 0.67-1.33) with evidence of statistical interaction (adjusted interaction p-value = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS In a real-world population, PCI can be selected more favorably as an alternative to CABG in patients fulfilling the enrollment criteria of the EXCEL trial."

BACKGROUND The Charlson and Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices are the most widely used comorbidity assessment methods in medical research. Both methods are adapted for use with the International Classification of Diseases, which 10th revision (ICD-10) is used by over a hundred countries in the world. Available Charlson and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index calculating methods are limited to a few applications with command-line user interfaces, all requiring specific programming language skills. This study aims to use Microsoft Excel to develop a non-programming and ICD-10 based dataset calculator for Charlson and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index and to validate its results with R- and SAS-based methods. METHODS The Excel-based dataset calculator was developed using the program's formulae, ICD-10 coding algorithms, and different weights of the Charlson and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Real, population-wide, nine-year spanning, index hip fracture data from the Estonian Health Insurance Fund was used for validating the calculator. The Excel-based calculator's output values and processing speed were compared to R- and SAS-based methods. RESULTS A total of 11,491 hip fracture patients' comorbidities were used for validating the Excel-based calculator. The Excel-based calculator's results were consistent, revealing no discrepancies, with R- and SAS-based methods while comparing 192,690 and 353,265 output values of Charlson and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, respectively. The Excel-based calculator's processing speed was slower but differing only from a few seconds up to four minutes with datasets including 6250-200,000 patients. CONCLUSIONS This study proposes a novel, validated, and non-programming-based method for calculating Charlson and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index scores. As the comorbidity calculations can be conducted in Microsoft Excel's simple graphical point-and-click interface, the new method lowers the threshold for calculating these two widely used indices.

The Evaluation of XIENCE versus EXCEL (Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) trial is the largest randomized study comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with second-generation drug-eluting stents and bypass surgery in unprotected left main disease (ULMD). Our aim was to assess which proportion of patients from a contemporary all-comer population of ULMD PCI would be eligible for the EXCEL trial and whether these patients show different long-term outcomes than the rest of the ULMD population. A total of 246 consecutive patients underwent ULMD PCI between January 2018 and December 2021 and were retrospectively analyzed. After application of the EXCEL trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, 98 patients (39%) were allocated to the \"EXCEL-like\" cohort and 148 to the \"non-EXCEL-like.\" Baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were substantially comparable. The mean baseline SYNTAX score was lower in the EXCEL-like patients than the non-EXCEL-like group (20.1 \u00b1 7.1 vs 23.0 \u00b1 11.2, p = 0.025), with the latter also showing a higher degree of incomplete revascularization (residual SYNTAX score >8 : 11% vs 26%, p = 0.005). At 1 year, the cumulative major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events rate was 7% for the EXCEL-like and 17% for the non-EXCEL-like patients, respectively (p = 0.03). At the last follow-up available, the significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events rate persisted (19% vs 37%, p = 0.02) and a significant difference in any unplanned revascularization was also shown (1.5% vs 13%, p = 0.04). In conclusion, in a contemporary real-world cohort of ULMD PCI, only a minority of patients could be enrolled in the EXCEL trial; the EXCEL-like patients, in our population, showed less clinical events at long-term follow-up than the cohort of patients who were ineligible for EXCEL, despite comparable baseline cardiovascular profiles; these findings may challenge a broad external applicability of the results of the EXCEL trial in routine clinical activity."

This study had two aims: first, we sought to replicate therapy-associated changes in DNA methylation of commonly assessed candidate genes in isolated monocytes from 60 female patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our second, exploratory goal was to identify novel genomic regions with substantial pre-to-post intervention DNA methylation changes by performing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) in two patients with PTSD. Equivalence testing and Bayesian analyses provided evidence against physiologically meaningful intervention-associated DNA methylation changes in monocytes of PTSD patients in commonly investigated target genes (NR3C1, FKBP5, SLC6A4, OXTR). Furthermore, WGBS yielded only a limited set of candidate regions with suggestive evidence of differential DNA methylation pre- to post-therapy. These differential DNA methylation patterns did not prove replicable when investigated in the entire cohort.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is unique among psychiatric disorders since there is an explicit requirement for the presence of a well-defined precipitating environmental event. This suggests the participation of adaptable molecular processes such as epigenetic modifications, including acetylation and methylation of histones and DNA methylation. In the present study we investigated whether changes in DNA methylation are associated with the effects of traumatic stressor, using a validated PTSD rat model. Screening of genomic DNA methylation patterns revealed that maladaptation to traumatic stress is associated with numerous changes in the methylation pattern of rat hippocampus. Of the differentially methylated genes revealed by this global screening, Disks Large-Associated Protein (Dlgap2) was of special interest, demonstrating an increase in a specific methylation site which was associated with a reduction in its gene expression in PTSD-like compared to non-PTSD-like rats. The association between the methylation rate and Dlgap2 expression was further substantiated by re-dividing the rats according to their methylation state. A significantly higher expression was observed in the non-methylated compared to methylated rats. In addition, taking all rats as one group revealed a significant correlation between their behavioural stress responses and Dlgap2 transcript levels. These results suggest that alterations in global methylation pattern are involved in behavioural adaptation to environmental stress and pinpoint Dlgap2 as a possible target in PTSD."

Methylation of DNA may provide key insights, as it likely is reflective of factors that may increase the risk in trauma patients, as DNA methylation is altered by previous stressors. Here, we compared DNA methylation patterns using bisulfite sequencing in patients with a physical trauma that required more than a 24-h hospitalization (n = 33). We then compared DNA methylation in patients who developed and compared the following groups (1) PTSD and MDD; n = 12), (2) MDD (patients with MDD only; n = 12), and (3) control (patients who did not have PTSD or MDD; n = 9), determined by the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) at 6-months follow-up. We identified 17 genes with hypermethylated cytosine sites and 2 genes with hypomethylated sites in comparison between PTSD and control group. In comparison between MDD and control group, we identified 12 genes with hypermethylated cytosine sites and 6 genes with hypomethylated sites. Demethylation of these genes altered the CREB signaling pathway in neurons and may represent a promising therapeutic development target for PTSD and MDD. Our findings suggest that epigenetic changes in these gene regions potentially relate to the onset and symptomology of PTSD and MDD and could be used as potential biomarkers in predicting the onset of PTSD or MDD following traumatic events."

Total Life Stress (TLS) was also assessed in all subjects. We evaluated DNA extracted from peripheral blood using the HumanMethylation27 BeadChip and analyzed both global and site-specific methylation. Methylation levels were examined for association with PTSD, child abuse history, and TLS using a linear mixed model adjusted for age, sex, and chip effects. Global methylation was increased in subjects with PTSD. CpG sites in five genes (TPR, CLEC9A, APC5, ANXA2, and TLR8) were differentially methylated in subjects with PTSD. Additionally, a CpG site in NPFFR2 was associated with TLS after adjustment for multiple testing. Notably, many of these genes have been previously associated with inflammation. Given these results and reports of immune dysregulation associated with trauma history, we compared plasma cytokine levels in these subjects and found IL4, IL2, and TNF\u03b1 levels associated with PTSD, child abuse, and TLS.

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given psychosocial stress composed of two acute cat exposures in conjunction with 31 days of daily social instability. These manipulations have been shown previously to produce physiological and behavioral sequelae in rats that are comparable to symptoms observed in traumatized people with PTSD. We then assessed Bdnf DNA methylation patterns (at exon IV) and gene expression. We have found here that the psychosocial stress regimen significantly increased Bdnf DNA methylation in the dorsal hippocampus, with the most robust hypermethylation detected in the dorsal CA1 subregion. Conversely, the psychosocial stress regimen significantly decreased methylation in the ventral hippocampus (CA3). No changes in Bdnf DNA methylation were detected in the medial prefrontal cortex or basolateral amygdala. In addition, there were decreased levels of Bdnf mRNA in both the dorsal and ventral CA1. These results provide evidence that traumatic stress occurring in adulthood can induce CNS gene methylation, and specifically, support the hypothesis that epigenetic marking of the Bdnf gene may underlie hippocampal dysfunction in response to traumatic stress. Furthermore, this work provides support for the speculative notion that altered hippocampal Bdnf DNA methylation is a cellular mechanism underlying the persistent cognitive deficits which are prominent features of the pathophysiology of PTSD."

Studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level increase is associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk. BDNF may be a \"missing-link\" that mediates the interaction between genetics, environment, and the sympathetic system. Trauma has been shown to induce DNA methylation that in turn can increase BDNF concentration due to increased gene expression. Therapies that focus on the reduction of beta-NGF (BNGF) levels may impact PTSD symptoms. The focus of this paper is to discuss possible effect of stellate ganglion block (SGB) on epigenetic changes noted with PTSD mediated by BDNF and NGF. Stellate ganglion block has recently shown significant therapeutic efficacy for treatment of PTSD symptoms. Previously reported theoretical mechanisms of SGB impact on PTSD have focused on likely reduction of NGF, leading to eventual loss of extraneous sympathetic nerve growth, eventually leading to reduction of secondary norepinephrine level, which in turn is hypothesized to reduce PTSD symptoms. We used PUBMED to obtain available data following a search for the following: DNA, neurotrophic factors, post-traumatic stress disorder, and demethylation following local anesthetic application. A number of articles meeting criteria were found and reviewed. Based on the evidence summarized, trauma can lead to DNA methylation, as well as BNGF/NGF level increase, which in turn starts a cascade of sympathetic sprouting, leading to increased brain norepinephrine, and finally symptomatic PTSD. Cascade reversal may occur in part by demethylation of DNA caused by application of local anesthetic to the stellate ganglion."

Overall, a number of NR3C1 CpG sites were significantly associated with trauma or psychopathology, but significant findings were often inconsistent across studies. This lack of consistency is likely influenced by significant methodological variability - experimentally and analytically - across studies. Selected common genetic variants show no significant effect on NR3C1 CpG methylation. In contrast, there was ample evidence linking increased methylation of NR3C1 to reduced expression of this gene.

Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the main and interacting effects of candidate genes' methylation values and number of potentially traumatic events (PTEs), adjusting for age and other covariates. Results revealed that only one candidate gene - MAN2C1} - showed a significant methylation x PTE interaction, such that those with both higher MAN2C1 methylation and greater exposure to PTEs showed a marked increase in risk of lifetime PTSD (OR 4.35, 95% CI: 1.07, 17.77, p=0.04).

However, some viruses have evolved anti-autophagy strategies to escape host immunity and to promote viral replication.

Suppressed autophagy activity enhanced viral transduction and overexpression of autophagosomes reduced viral transduction, suggesting that autophagy is involved in degradation process of viral particles. Actin filaments were involved in the viral transduction, while microtubules negatively regulated viral transduction by facilitating the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, where degradation of viral particles occurs.

By knocking down the expression or activity of five autophagy-related proteins, we confirmed the proviral function that the autophagic machinery exerts on HCMV production. Using 3D reconstruction from confocal microscopy and electron microscopy, we demonstrated that lipidated LC3-positive vesicles accumulated at the viral assembly compartment (vAC). The vAC is a juxtanuclear ring-shaped structure containing several organelles and membranes, where assembly and final envelopment of HCMV particles occur. Two LC3 homologs, GABARAPL1 and GATE16, also accumulated during HCMV infection and were associated with the vAC, in proximity with fragmented Golgi stacks. Additionally, we observed the formation of a pre-assembly compartment (PrAC) in infected cells, which consists of a juxtanuclear structure containing both fragmented Golgi and LC3-positive vesicles. Finally, we showed that highly purified extracellular viral particles were associated with various autophagy proteins.

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic cellular process that exerts antiviral functions during a viral invasion. However, co-evolution and co-adaptation between viruses and autophagy have armed viruses with multiple strategies to subvert the autophagic machinery and counteract cellular antiviral responses. Specifically, the host cell quickly initiates the autophagy to degrade virus particles or virus components upon a viral infection, while cooperating with anti-viral interferon response to inhibit the virus replication. Degraded virus-derived antigens can be presented to T lymphocytes to orchestrate the adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, some viruses have evolved the ability to inhibit autophagy in order to evade degradation and immune responses. Others induce autophagy, but then hijack autophagosomes as a replication site, or hijack the secretion autophagy pathway to promote maturation and egress of virus particles, thereby increasing replication and transmission efficiency. Interestingly, different viruses have unique strategies to counteract different types of selective autophagy, such as exploiting autophagy to regulate organelle degradation, metabolic processes, and immune responses. In short, this review focuses on the interaction between autophagy and viruses, explaining how autophagy serves multiple roles in viral infection, with either proviral or antiviral functions."

Influenza A virus (IAV) is an infectious pathogen, threatening the population and public safety with its epidemics. Therefore, it is essential to better understand influenza virus biology to develop efficient strategies against its pathogenicity. Autophagy is an important cellular process to maintain cellular homeostasis by cleaning up the hazardous substrates in lysosome. Accumulating research has also suggested that autophagy is a critical mechanism in host defense responses against IAV infection by degrading viral particles and activating innate or acquired immunity to induce viral clearance. However, IAV has conversely hijacked autophagy to strengthen virus infection by blocking autophagy maturation and further interfering host antiviral signalling to promote viral replication. Therefore, how the battle for autophagy between host and IAV is carried out need to be known. In this review, we describe the role of autophagy in host defence and IAV survival, and summarize the role of influenza proteins in subverting the autophagic process as well as then concentrate on how host utilize antiviral function of autophagy to prevent IAV infection."

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an enveloped Flavivirus with a positive-sense RNA genome, causes acute encephalitis with high mortality in humans. We used a virulent (RP-9) and an attenuated (RP-2ms) JEV strain to assess the role of autophagy in JEV infection. By monitoring the levels of lipidated LC3, we found that autophagy was induced in human NT-2 cells infected with RP-2ms, especially at the late stage, and to a lesser extent with RP-9. The induction of autophagy by rapamycin increased viral production, whereas the inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine reduced viral yields for both RP-9 and RP-2ms. The viral replication of RP-9 and RP-2ms was also reduced in cells with downregulated ATG5 or Beclin 1 expression, suggesting a proviral role of autophagy in JEV replication. To determine the step of JEV life cycle affected by autophagy, we used an mCherry-LC3 fusion protein as the autophagosome marker. Little of no colocalization of LC3 puncta with dsRNA was noted, whereas the input JEV particles were targeted to autophagosomes stained positive for early endosome marker. Overall, we show for the first time that the cellular autophagy process is involved in JEV infection and the inoculated viral particles traffic to autophagosomes for subsequent steps of viral infection."

Marine photosynthetic microorganisms are the basis of marine food webs and are responsible for nearly 50% of the global primary production. Emiliania huxleyi forms massive oceanic blooms that are routinely terminated by large double-stranded DNA coccolithoviruses. The cellular mechanisms that govern the replication cycle of these giant viruses are largely unknown. We used diverse techniques, including fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cryoelectron tomography, immunolabeling and biochemical methodologies to investigate the role of autophagy in host-virus interactions. Hallmarks of autophagy are induced during the lytic phase of E. huxleyi viral infection, concomitant with up-regulation of autophagy-related genes (ATG genes). Pretreatment of the infected cells with an autophagy inhibitor causes a major reduction in the production of extracellular viral particles, without reducing viral DNA replication within the cell. The host-encoded Atg8 protein was detected within purified virions, demonstrating the pivotal role of the autophagy-like process in viral assembly and egress. We show that autophagy, which is classically considered as a defense mechanism, is essential for viral propagation and for facilitating a high burst size. This cellular mechanism may have a major impact on the fate of the viral-infected blooms, and therefore on the cycling of nutrients within the marine ecosystem."

Autophagy is an essential vacuolar process of the cell, leading to lysosomal degradation and recycling of proteins and organelles, which is extremely important in maintaining homeostasis. Multiple roles have been now associated with autophagy, in particular a pro-survival role in nutrient starvation or in stressful environments, a role in life span extension, in development, or in innate and adaptive immunity. This cellular process can also take over microorganisms or viral proteins inside autophagosomes and degrade them directly in autolysosomes and is then called xenophagy and virophagy, respectively. Several Herpesviruses have developed strategies to escape this degradation, by expression of specific anti-autophagic proteins. However, we are increasingly discovering that Herpesviruses hijack autophagy, rather than just fight it. This beneficial effect is obvious since inhibition of autophagy will lead to decreased viral titers for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV), for example. Conversely, autophagy stimulation will improve viral multiplication. The autophagic machinery can be used in whole or in part, and can optimize viral propagation or persistence. Some viruses block maturation of autophagosomes to avoid the degradation step, then autophagosomal membranes are used to contribute to the envelopment and/or the egress of viral particles. On the other hand, VZV stimulates the whole process of autophagy to subvert it in order to use vesicles containing ATG (autophagy-related) proteins and resembling amphisomes for their transport in the cytoplasm. During latency, autophagy can also be activated by latent proteins encoded by different oncogenic Herpesviruses to promote cell survival and achieve long term viral persistence in vivo. Finally, reactivation of gammaherpesvirus Murid Herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) in mice appears to be positively modulated by autophagy, in order to control the level of inflammation. Therefore, Herpesviruses appear to behave more like thieves than fugitives."

Autophagy is a cellular process involved in the degradation and turn-over of long-lived proteins and organelles, which can be subjected to suppression or further induction in response to different stimuli. According to its essential role in cellular homeostasis, autophagy has been implicated in several pathologies including cancer, neurodegeneration and myopathies. More recently, autophagy has been described as a mechanism of both innate and adaptive immunity against intracellular bacteria and viruses. In this context, autophagy has been proposed as a protective mechanism against viral infection by degrading the pathogens into autolysosomes. This is strengthened by the fact that several proteins involved in interferon (IFN) signalling pathways are linked to autophagy regulation. However, several viruses have evolved strategies to divert IFN-mediated pathways and autophagy to their own benefit. This review provides an overview of the autophagic process and its involvement in the infection by different viral pathogens and of the connections existing between autophagy and proteins involved in IFN signalling pathways."

Despite intense scientific efforts, patients diagnosed with GBM and treated with the current standard of care have a median survival of only 15 months. Patients are initially treated by a neurosurgeon with the goal of maximal safe resection of the tumor. Obtaining tissue samples during surgery is indispensable for the diagnosis of GBM. Technological improvements, such as navigation systems and intraoperative monitoring, significantly advanced the possibility of safe gross tumor resection. Usually within six weeks after the surgery, concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide are initiated. However, current radiotherapy regimens are based on population-level studies and could also be improved. Implementing artificial intelligence in radiotherapy planning might be used to individualize treatment plans. Furthermore, detailed genetic and molecular markers of the tumor could provide patient-tailored immunochemotherapy. In this article, we review current standard of care and possibilities of personalizing these treatments. Additionally, we discuss novel individualized therapeutic options with encouraging results. Due to inherent heterogeneity of GBM, applying patient-tailored treatment could significantly prolong survival of these patients."

OBJECT Glioblastoma is a highly malignant brain tumor, for which standard treatment consists of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Increasing extent of tumor resection (EOTR) is associated with prolonged survival. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) is used to increase EOTR, based on contrast enhanced MR images. The correlation between intraoperative contrast enhancement and tumor has not been studied systematically. METHODS For this prospective cohort study, we recruited 10 patients with a supratentorial brain tumor suspect for a glioblastoma. After initial resection, a 0.15 Tesla iMRI scan was made and neuronavigation-guided biopsies were taken from the border of the resection cavity. Scores for gadolinium-based contrast enhancement on iMRI and for tissue characteristics in histological slides of the biopsies were used to calculate correlations (expressed in Kendall's tau). RESULTS A total of 39 biopsy samples was available for further analysis. Contrast enhancement was significantly correlated with World Health Organization (WHO) grade (tau 0.50), vascular changes (tau 0.53), necrosis (tau 0.49), and increased cellularity (tau 0.26). Specificity of enhancement patterns scored as \"thick linear\" and \"tumor-like\" for detection of (high grade) tumor was 1, but decreased to circa 0.75 if \"thin linear\" enhancement was included. Sensitivity for both enhancement patterns varied around 0.39-0.48 and 0.61-0.70, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Presence of intraoperative contrast enhancement is a good predictor for presence of tumor, but absence of contrast enhancement is a bad predictor for absence of tumor. The use of gadolinium-based contrast enhancement on iMRI to maximize glioblastoma resection should be evaluated against other methods to increase resection, like new contrast agents, other imaging modalities, and \"functional neurooncology\" - an approach to achieve surgical resection guided by functional rather than oncological-anatomical boundaries."

Standard of care consists of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and concomitant and maintenance temozolomide (temozolomide/radiotherapy\u2192temozolomide). Corticosteroids are commonly used perioperatively to control cerebral oedema and are frequently continued throughout subsequent treatment, notably radiotherapy, for amelioration of side effects. The effects of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone on cell growth in glioma models and on patient survival have remained controversial. We performed a retrospective analysis of glioblastoma patient cohorts to determine the prognostic role of steroid administration. A disease-relevant mouse model of glioblastoma was used to characterize the effects of dexamethasone on tumour cell proliferation and death, and to identify gene signatures associated with these effects. A murine anti-VEGFA antibody was used in parallel as an alternative for oedema control. We applied the dexamethasone-induced gene signature to The Cancer Genome Atlas glioblastoma dataset to explore the association of dexamethasone exposure with outcome. Mouse experiments were used to validate the effects of dexamethasone on survival in vivo Retrospective clinical analyses identified corticosteroid use during radiotherapy as an independent indicator of shorter survival in three independent patient cohorts. A dexamethasone-associated gene expression signature correlated with shorter survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas patient dataset. In glioma-bearing mice, dexamethasone pretreatment decreased tumour cell proliferation without affecting tumour cell viability, but reduced survival when combined with radiotherapy. Conversely, anti-VEGFA antibody decreased proliferation and increased tumour cell death, but did not affect survival when combined with radiotherapy. Clinical and mouse experimental data suggest that corticosteroids may decrease the effectiveness of treatment and shorten survival in glioblastoma. Dexamethasone-induced anti-proliferative effects may confer protection from radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced genotoxic stress. This study highlights the importance of identifying alternative agents such as vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists for managing oedema in glioblastoma patients. Beyond the established adverse effect profile of protracted corticosteroid use, this analysis substantiates the request for prudent and restricted use of corticosteroids in glioblastoma."

BACKGROUND Intraoperative prediction of radiochemosensitivity is desirable for improving the clinical management of glioblastoma (GBM) patients. We have previously developed an original technique for intraoperative flow cytometry (iFC) and defined a malignancy index (MI). OBJECTIVE To determine whether MI correlates with prognosis in GBM patients who underwent the standard treatment protocol of radiotherapy and temozolomide administration. METHODS The current study included 102 patients with GBM that had been newly diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 who underwent our iFC analysis and received the standard treatment protocol. We evaluated MI values in each patient, then statistically analyzed the relationship between MI and prognosis using survival analysis that include other clinicopathological factors (age, sex, Karnofsky performance status [KPS], extent of resection, second-line bevacizumab, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase [MGMT] status, MIB-1 labeling index, and mutation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene [IDH1]). RESULTS Log-rank test revealed that age, KPS, extent of resection, MGMT status, IDH1 mutation, and high MI (\u226526.3%) significantly correlated with overall survival. Multivariate analysis with Cox regression modeling identified MI as the most significant prognostic factor (hazard ratio = 2.246; 95% confidence interval = 1.347-3.800; P = .0019). MI showed strong correlation with IDH1 mutation status in chi-square test (P = .0023). In addition, log-rank test revealed that MI affects overall survival more strongly in patients with IDH1 wildtype than those with IDH1 mutant. CONCLUSION MI from an iFC study may help predict the prognosis in patients with GBM who receive the standard treatment. Survival can be related to sensitivity to radio-chemotherapy."

Advances in modern technologies and computers have enabled digital image processing to become a vital tool in conventional clinical practice, including mammography. However, the core problem of the clinical evaluation of mammographic tumors remains a highly demanding cognitive task. In order for these automated diagnostic systems to perform in levels of sensitivity and specificity similar to that of human experts, it is essential that a robust framework on problem-specific design parameters is formulated. This study is focused on identifying a robust set of clinical features that can be used as the base for designing the input of any computer-aided diagnosis system for automatic mammographic tumor evaluation. A thorough list of clinical features was constructed and the diagnostic value of each feature was verified against current clinical practices by an expert physician. These features were directly or indirectly related to the overall morphological properties of the mammographic tumor or the texture of the fine-scale tissue structures as they appear in the digitized image, while others contained external clinical data of outmost importance, like the patient's age. The entire feature set was used as an annotation list for describing the clinical properties of mammographic tumor cases in a quantitative way, such that subsequent objective analyses were possible. For the purposes of this study, a mammographic image database was created, with complete clinical evaluation descriptions and positive histological verification for each case. All tumors contained in the database were characterized according to the identified clinical features' set and the resulting dataset was used as input for discrimination and diagnostic value analysis for each one of these features. Specifically, several standard methodologies of statistical significance analysis were employed to create feature rankings according to their discriminating power. Moreover, three different classification models, namely linear classifiers, neural networks and support vector machines, were employed to investigate the true efficiency of each one of them, as well as the overall complexity of the diagnostic task of mammographic tumor characterization. Both the statistical and the classification results have proven the explicit correlation of all the selected features with the final diagnosis, qualifying them as an adequate input base for any type of similar automated diagnosis system. The underlying complexity of the diagnostic task has justified the high value of sophisticated pattern recognition architectures."

List-mode positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction is an important tool for PET scanners with many lines-of-response and additional information such as time-of-flight and depth-of-interaction. Deep learning is one possible solution to enhance the quality of PET image reconstruction. However, the application of deep learning techniques to list-mode PET image reconstruction has not been progressed because list data is a sequence of bit codes and unsuitable for processing by convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this study, we propose a novel list-mode PET image reconstruction method using an unsupervised CNN called deep image prior (DIP) which is the first trial to integrate list-mode PET image reconstruction and CNN. The proposed list-mode DIP reconstruction (LM-DIPRecon) method alternatively iterates the regularized list-mode dynamic row action maximum likelihood algorithm (LM-DRAMA) and magnetic resonance imaging conditioned DIP (MR-DIP) using an alternating direction method of multipliers. We evaluated LM-DIPRecon using both simulation and clinical data, and it achieved sharper images and better tradeoff curves between contrast and noise than the LM-DRAMA, MR-DIP and sinogram-based DIPRecon methods. These results indicated that the LM-DIPRecon is useful for quantitative PET imaging with limited events while keeping accurate raw data information. In addition, as list data has finer temporal information than dynamic sinograms, list-mode deep image prior reconstruction is expected to be useful for 4D PET imaging and motion correction."

Backmasking is a recording technique used to hide a sound or message in a music track in reverse, meaning that it is only audible when the record is played backwards. Analogously, the compact yeast genome encodes for diverse sources of information such as overlapping coding and non-coding transcripts, and protein-binding sites on the two complementary DNA strands. Examples are the consensus binding site sequences of the RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 that target non-coding transcripts for degradation. Here, by examining the overlap of stable (SUTs, stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable (CUTs, cryptic unstable transcripts) transcripts with protein-coding genes, we show that the predicted Nrd1 and Nab3-binding site sequences occur at differing frequencies. They are always depleted in the sense direction of protein-coding genes, thus avoiding degradation of the transcript. However in the antisense direction, predicted binding sites occur at high frequencies in genes with overlapping unstable ncRNAs (CUTs), so limiting the availability of non-functional transcripts. In contrast they are depleted in genes with overlapping stable ncRNAs (SUTs), presumably to avoid degrading the non-coding transcript. The protein-coding genes maintain similar amino-acid contents, but they display distinct codon usages so that Nrd1 and Nab3-binding sites can arise at differing frequencies in antisense depending on the overlapping transcript type. Our study demonstrates how yeast has evolved to encode multiple layers of information-protein-coding genes in one strand and the relative chance of degrading antisense RNA in the other strand-in the same regions of a compact genome."

In nrd1 and nab3 mutants, we observe 3'-extended transcripts originating from CUT promoters but failing to terminate through the Nrd1- and Nab3-directed pathway. Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components for degradation.

Pervasive and hidden transcription is widespread in eukaryotes, but its global level, the mechanisms from which it originates and its functional significance are unclear. Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) were recently described as a principal class of RNA polymerase II transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These transcripts are targeted for degradation immediately after synthesis by the action of the Nrd1-exosome-TRAMP complexes. Although CUT degradation mechanisms have been analysed in detail, the genome-wide distribution at the nucleotide resolution and the prevalence of CUTs are unknown. Here we report the first high-resolution genomic map of CUTs in yeast, revealing a class of potentially functional CUTs and the intrinsic bidirectional nature of eukaryotic promoters. An RNA fraction highly enriched in CUTs was analysed by a 3' Long-SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) approach adapted to deep sequencing. The resulting detailed genomic map of CUTs revealed that they derive from extremely widespread and very well defined transcription units and do not result from unspecific transcriptional noise. Moreover, the transcription of CUTs predominantly arises within nucleosome-free regions, most of which correspond to promoter regions of bona fide genes. Some of the CUTs start upstream from messenger RNAs and overlap their 5' end. Our study of glycolysis genes, as well as recent results from the literature, indicate that such concurrent transcription is potentially associated with regulatory mechanisms. Our data reveal numerous new CUTs with such a potential regulatory role. However, most of the identified CUTs corresponded to transcripts divergent from the promoter regions of genes, indicating that they represent by-products of divergent transcription occurring at many and possibly most promoters. Eukaryotic promoter regions are thus intrinsically bidirectional, a fundamental property that escaped previous analyses because in most cases divergent transcription generates short-lived unstable transcripts present at very low steady-state levels."

This is the same processing pathway used by yeast snoRNAs. Whereas CUTs are only easily observed in cells lacking the Rrp6 or Rrp47 subunits of the nuclear exosome, Stable Uncharacterized Transcripts (SUTs) are present even in wild-type cells. Here we show that SUTs are partially susceptible to the nuclear exosome, but are primarily degraded by cytoplasmic 5' to 3' degradation and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Therefore, SUTs may be processed similarly to mRNAs. Surprisingly, both CUTs and SUTs were found to produce 3' extended species that were also subject to cytoplasmic degradation. The functions, if any, of these extended CUTs and SUTs are unknown, but their discovery suggests that yeasts generate transcripts reminiscent of long non-coding RNAs found in higher eukaryotes."

CUTs are often considered as by-products of transcriptional noise, but in an increasing number of cases they play a central role in the control of gene expression. Regulatory mechanisms involving expression of a CUT are diverse and include attenuation, transcriptional interference, and alternative transcription start site choice. This review focuses on the impact of cryptic transcription on gene expression, describes the role of the Nrd1-complex as the main actor in preventing nonfunctional and potentially harmful transcription, and details a few systems where expression of a CUT has an essential regulatory function.

Notably, position sensing correlates with the phosphorylation status of the polymerase C-terminal domain (CTD). The Nrd1 complex is recruited to chromatin via interactions with both the nascent RNA and the CTD, but a permissive phosphorylation status of the latter is absolutely required for efficient transcription termination.

Nuclear RNA degradation pathways are highly conserved across eukaryotes and play important roles in RNA quality control. Key substrates for exosomal degradation include aberrant functional RNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). It has recently been reported that the nuclear exosome is inactivated during meiosis in budding yeast through degradation of the subunit Rrp6, leading to the stabilisation of a subset of meiotic unannotated transcripts (MUTs) of unknown function. We have analysed the activity of the nuclear exosome during meiosis by deletion of TRF4, which encodes a key component of the exosome targeting complex TRAMP. We find that TRAMP mutants produce high levels of CUTs during meiosis that are undetectable in wild-type cells, showing that the nuclear exosome remains functional for CUT degradation, and we further report that the meiotic exosome complex contains Rrp6. Indeed Rrp6 over-expression is insufficient to suppress MUT transcripts, showing that the reduced amount of Rrp6 in meiotic cells does not directly cause MUT accumulation. Lack of TRAMP activity stabilises \u223c 1600 CUTs in meiotic cells, which occupy 40% of the binding capacity of the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC). CBC mutants display defects in the formation of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs), and we see similar defects in TRAMP mutants, suggesting that a key function of the nuclear exosome is to prevent saturation of the CBC complex by CUTs.

These CUTs originate from different types of genomic features, but the highest increase corresponds to Tf2 retrotransposons and rDNA repeats, where they map along the entire elements. In the absence of abp1, increased RNAPII-Ser5P occupancy is observed throughout the Tf2 coding region and, unexpectedly, RNAPII-Ser5P is enriched at rDNA repeats.

BACKGROUND Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are a largely unexplored class of nuclear exosome degraded, non-coding RNAs in budding yeast. It is highly debated whether CUT transcription has a functional role in the cell or whether CUTs represent noise in the yeast transcriptome. We sought to ascertain the extent of conserved CUT expression across a variety of Saccharomyces yeast strains to further understand and characterize the nature of CUT expression. RESULTS We sequenced the WT and rrp6\u0394 transcriptomes of three S.cerevisiae strains: S288c, \u03a31278b, JAY291 and the S.paradoxus strain N17 and utilized a hidden Markov model to annotate CUTs in these four strains. Utilizing a four-way genomic alignment we identified a large population of CUTs with conserved syntenic expression across all four strains. By identifying configurations of gene-CUT pairs, where CUT expression originates from the gene 5' or 3' nucleosome free region, we observed distinct gene expression trends specific to these configurations which were most prevalent in the presence of conserved CUT expression. Divergent pairs correlate with higher expression of genes, and convergent pairs correlate with reduced gene expression. CONCLUSIONS Our RNA-seq based method has greatly expanded upon previous CUT annotations in S.cerevisiae underscoring the extensive and pervasive nature of unstable transcription. Furthermore we provide the first assessment of conserved CUT expression in yeast and globally demonstrate possible modes of CUT-based regulation of gene expression."

CTCF has been directly and indirectly linked to the modulation of AS at the individual transcript and at the transcriptome-wide level. The emerging role of CTCF-mediated regulation of AS involves diverse mechanisms; including transcriptional elongation, DNA methylation, chromatin architecture, histone modifications, and regulation of splicing factor expression and assembly. CTCF thereby appears to not only co-ordinate gene expression regulation but contributes to the modulation of transcriptomic complexity. In this review, we highlight previous discoveries regarding the role of CTCF in AS. In addition, we summarize detailed mechanisms by which CTCF mediates AS regulation. We propose opportunities for further research designed to examine the possible fate of CTCF-mediated alternatively spliced genes and associated biological consequences.

BACKGROUND Alternative splicing is primarily controlled by the activity of splicing factors and by the elongation of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Recent experiments have suggested a new complex network of splicing regulation involving chromatin, transcription and multiple protein factors. In particular, the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), the Argonaute protein AGO1, and members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family have been implicated in the regulation of splicing associated with chromatin and the elongation of RNAPII. These results raise the question of whether these proteins may associate at the chromatin level to modulate alternative splicing. RESULTS Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data for CTCF, AGO1, HP1\u03b1, H3K27me3, H3K9me2, H3K36me3, RNAPII, total H3 and 5metC and alternative splicing arrays from two cell lines, we have analyzed the combinatorial code of their binding to chromatin in relation to the alternative splicing patterns between two cell lines, MCF7 and MCF10. Using Machine Learning techniques, we identified the changes in chromatin signals that are most significantly associated with splicing regulation between these two cell lines. Moreover, we have built a map of the chromatin signals on the pre-mRNA, that is, a chromatin-based RNA-map, which can explain 606 (68.55%) of the regulated events between MCF7 and MCF10. This chromatin code involves the presence of HP1\u03b1, CTCF, AGO1, RNAPII and histone marks around regulated exons and can differentiate patterns of skipping and inclusion. Additionally, we found a significant association of HP1\u03b1 and CTCF activities around the regulated exons and a putative DNA binding site for HP1\u03b1. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that a considerable number of alternative splicing events could have a chromatin-dependent regulation involving the association of HP1\u03b1 and CTCF near regulated exons.

Normal cytogenetic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) frequently harbor a TCTG insertion in exon 12 of Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1); the resulting frameshift creates a nuclear export signal (NES) and cytoplasmic localization of NPM1c. However, how NPM1c causes AML is not completely understood. NPM1 participates in multiple protein-protein interactions one of which involves the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Through binding of CTCF binding sites (CBS), CTCF mediates nuclear functions including DNA looping, regulation of gene expression, and RNA splicing. We hypothesized that mislocalization of CTCF into the cytoplasm by NPM1c reduces the functional level of nuclear CTCF and so alters gene expression. We verified the interaction of CTCF with NPM1 and showed that CTCF interacts with NPM1c, with redistribution of CTCF into the cytoplasm. The interaction of CTCF and NPM1c involves the amino terminus of CTCF and the last 50 amino acids of NPM1. By interfering with the interaction of CTCF and NPM1c, CTCF becomes relocalized into the nucleus."

The multifunctional zinc-finger protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a very strong candidate for the role of coordinating the expression level of coding sequences with their three-dimensional position in the nucleus, apparently responding to a \"code\" in the DNA itself. Dynamic interactions between chromatin fibers in the context of nuclear architecture have been implicated in various aspects of genome functions. However, the molecular basis of these interactions still remains elusive and is a subject of intense debate. Here we discuss the nature of CTCF-DNA interactions, the CTCF-binding specificity to its binding sites and the relationship between CTCF and chromatin, and we examine data linking CTCF with gene regulation in the three-dimensional nuclear space. We discuss why these features render CTCF a very strong candidate for the role and propose a unifying model, the \"CTCF code,\" explaining the mechanistic basis of how the information encrypted in DNA may be interpreted by CTCF into diverse nuclear functions."

OBJECTIVES To review the English literature pertaining to idiopathic avascular necrosis of a vertebral body. As an illustrative example, the case of a 60-year-old woman with idiopathic avascular necrosis of L4 is presented. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Avascular necrosis of a vertebral body is an uncommon entity. Avascular necrosis has been described in the context of other underlying lesions, such as with malignancy, infection, radiation therapy, and systemic steroid treatment. The intravertebral vacuum cleft phenomenon seen on plain films has been strongly associated with vertebral body avascular necrosis. METHODS Literature and chart review was carried out. Vertebral body avascular necrosis was initially identified with imaging studies and confirmed with biopsy. A comprehensive preoperative evaluation did not identify a specific cause of avascular necrosis. The patient underwent vertebral body resection with fibula allograft struts. CONCLUSIONS Although vertebral body collapse in an osteoporotic individual is relatively common, a case is reported of vertebral body collapse and subsequent necrosis without evidence of underlying disease at 48-month follow-up. The current findings support the diagnosis of idiopathic avascular necrosis of L4."

BACKGROUND Kummell disease is defined as avascular necrosis of vertebra, occurs after the delayed posttraumatic osteoporotic vertebral collapse, and mainly occurs in adults older than 50 years of age. We report the first case of refracture of Kummell disease and epidural hematoma followed by paraparesis. CASE DESCRIPTION A 67-year-old woman with a known case of osteoporotic T12 fracture (3 months back) visited our outpatient clinic complaining of persistent back pain and paraparesis after jerking while getting up from the bed. Her neurology worsened suddenly in the next 2 days. A physical examination revealed grade 3 power in lower extremities with a lower extremity paresthesia and diminished bilateral knee and ankle reflexes. Urinary retention was also present. A plain radiographic examination of her thoracolumbar spine revealed osteoporotic compression fractures with almost 50% reduction in height of the 12th thoracic vertebra. Magnetic resonance imaging showed dorsal epidural soft tissue mass that caused posterior compression of the spinal cord at the T12-L3 levels. We performed thoracic lateral retropleural corpectomy and cage insertion at T12. Bone cement-augmented pedicle screw fixation was performed at the T10, T11, and L1 levels with laminectomy and decompression of hematoma at the T12, L1, L2, and L3 levels as a stage 1 procedure. CONCLUSIONS Although rare, the possibility of refracture of Kummell disease and spinal epidural hematoma should be kept in mind in patients with osteoporotic fractures. Periodic follow-up and treatment are essential for preventing tragic neurologic impairment."

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. OBJECTIVE To identify fracture morphology-dependent risk factors for the occurrence of cement leakage during percutaneous vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Extravertebral cement leakage is the most frequently reported complication and represents a major risk after vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty. Despite the frequent occurrence of cement leakage and potentially dangerous complications and sequelae, there are few reports that examine its predictors. METHODS Retrospective review of 194 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty for painful osteoporotic or malignant vertebral fracture. The influences of several parameters that might affect the occurrence of cement leakage were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Cement leakage was assessed using computed tomography scanning and classified into 4 different types with different potential sequelae: through the basivertebral vein, through the segmental vein, through a cortical defect, and intradiscal leakage. RESULTS Leakage of cement was detected in 209 of the 272 treated vertebrae (76.83%). The most common types of leakage detected were through the basivertebral vein (43.38%) and the segmental vein (42.27%). None of the evaluated variables showed a statistically significant effect. Only the absence of Kummell disease (P = 0.063) and a lower severity grade of collapse (P = 0.068) approached statistical significance. For basivertebral vein leakages, the location at the thoracolumbar level and the absence of Kummell disease (P < 0.05) were strong predictive factors for cement leakages. For segmental vein leakages, the odds decreased as the severity grade of collapse increased (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION Each different vertebral fracture pattern has its own risk factors for cement leakage. For certain types of leakage, Kummell avascular necrosis as a protective factor and fracture severity grade with paradoxical effect have each demonstrated influence in the occurrence of cement leakage.

BACKGROUND Kummell disease is a clinical syndrome characterized by minor spinal trauma with a symptom-free period from months to years, followed by progressive painful kyphosis. Many surgical options for Kummell disease have been reported in the previous literature; however, no study has mentioned the surgical strategy for patients whose fractured vertebrae were severely compressed and only a slice of superior and inferior end plate was left. CASE DESCRIPTION Here we report the case of a 69-year-old woman who suffered persistent severe back pain since she slipped and fell 1 year before medical consult. The patient presented with constrained body posture and pressure pain on the thoracolumbar region. Visual analog scale pain under weight bearing was 90/100, and her Oswestry Disability Index score was 74%. Kummell disease was diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation, trauma history, radiograph, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. We performed the posterior vertebral column resection through the unilateral osteotomy approach for the patient, and the clinical outcome and radiologic restoration were recorded. One year after the surgery, outpatient follow-up review revealed that the visual analog scale reduced to 10/100 and Oswestry Disability Index reduced to 13%. The posteroanterior and lateral radiograph in the standing position showed bony fusion was achieved at the osteotomy site. No pseudarthrosis or instrumentation-related failure occurred. CONCLUSION Posterior vertebral column resection through unilateral osteotomy approach is an effective method for patients with Kummell disease, especially when the fractured vertebrae compressed severely and only a slice of superior and inferior end plate was left."

Complementary intron-mediated overexpression is one of the most utilized methodologies for circRNA research but not without bearing echoing skepticism for its poorly defined mechanism and latent coexistent side products. In this study, leveraging such circRNA overexpression system, we have interrogated the protein-coding potential of 30 human circRNAs containing infinite open reading frames in HEK293T cells. Surprisingly, pervasive translation signals are detected by immunoblotting. However, intensive mutagenesis reveals that numerous translation signals are generated independently of circRNA synthesis. We have developed a dual tag strategy to isolate translation noise and directly demonstrate that the spurious translation signals originate from cryptically spliced linear transcripts. The concomitant linear RNA byproducts, presumably concatemers, can be translated to allow pseudo rolling circle translation signals, and can involve backsplicing junction (BSJ) to disqualify the BSJ-based evidence for circRNA translation. We also find non-AUG start codons may engage in the translation initiation of circRNAs. Taken together, our systematic evaluation sheds light on heterogeneous translational outputs from circRNA overexpression vector and comes with a caveat that ectopic overexpression technique necessitates extremely rigorous control setup in circRNA translation and functional investigation."

A few circRNAs are also known to translate into functional polypeptides regulating cellular physiology. All these functions primarily depend on the full-length sequence of the circRNAs. CircRNA backsplice junction sequence is the key to identifying circRNAs and their full-length mature sequence. However, some multi-exonic circRNAs exist in different isoforms sharing identical backsplice junction sequences and are termed circRNA splice variants.

A subset of circRNAs with splice variants was validated by the circRNA-rolling circle amplification (circRNA-RCA) method. Interestingly, several validated circRNAs were predicted to translate into proteins by the riboCIRC database. Furthermore, polyribosome fractionation followed by quantitative PCR confirmed the association of a subset of circRNAs with polyribosome supporting their protein-coding potential.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs), covalently closed RNA molecules that form due to back-splicing of RNA transcripts, have recently been implicated in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies. circRNAs are regulated by N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) RNA methylation, can serve as \"sponges\" for proteins and RNAs, and can be translated into protein via a cap-independent mechanism. Mechanisms underlying circRNA dysregulation in tauopathies and causal relationships between circRNA and neurodegeneration are currently unknown. In the current study, we aimed to determine whether pathogenic forms of tau drive circRNA dysregulation and whether such dysregulation causally mediates neurodegeneration. We identify circRNAs that are differentially expressed in the brain of a Drosophila model of tauopathy and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying a tau mutation associated with autosomal dominant tauopathy. We leverage Drosophila to discover that depletion of circular forms of muscleblind ( circMbl) , a circRNA that is particularly abundant in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila , significantly suppresses tau neurotoxicity, suggesting that tau-induced circMbl elevation is neurotoxic. We detect a general elevation of m 6 A RNA methylation and circRNA methylation in tau transgenic Drosophila and find that tau-induced m 6 A methylation is a mechanistic driver of circMbl formation. Interestingly, we find that circRNA and m 6 A RNA accumulate within nuclear envelope invaginations of tau transgenic Drosophila and in iPSC-derived cerebral organoid models of tauopathy. Taken together, our studies add critical new insight into the mechanisms underlying circRNA dysregulation in tauopathy and identify m 6 A-modified circRNA as a causal factor contributing to neurodegeneration.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) encompass a widespread and conserved class of RNAs, which are generated by back-splicing of downstream 5' to upstream 3' splice sites. CircRNAs are tissue-specific and have been implicated in diseases including cancer. They can function as sponges for microRNAs (miRNAs) or RNA binding proteins (RBPs), for example. Moreover, some contain open reading frames (ORFs) and might be translated. The functional relevance of such peptides, however, remains largely elusive. Here, we report that the ORF of circZNF609 is efficiently translated when expressed from a circZNF609 overexpression construct. However, endogenous proteins could not be detected. Moreover, initiation of circZNF609 translation is independent of m6A-generating enzyme METTL3 or RNA sequence elements such as internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs). Surprisingly, a comprehensive mutational analysis revealed that deletion constructs, which are deficient in producing circZNF609, still generate the observed protein products. This suggests that the apparent circZNF609 translation originates from trans-splicing by-products of the overexpression plasmids and underline that circRNA overexpression constructs need to be evaluated carefully, particularly when functional studies are performed."

Renal biopsy revealed amyloid deposits in glomerular space, with absence of light chains and protein AA. We suspected amyloidosis with fibrinogen A alpha chain deposits, which is the most frequent cause of hereditary amyloidosis in Europe, with a glomerular preferential affectation.

On reviewing the biopsy of the patient's mother similar glomerular deposits were found, but there were significant deposits in the renal medulla as well, which is typical in APO AI amyloidosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Apo AI amyloidosis is characterized by slowly progressive renal disease and end-stage renal disease occurs aproximately 3 to 15 years from initial diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION Fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant disease associated with mutations in the fibrinogen A alpha chain (FGA) gene, and it is the most common cause of hereditary renal amyloidosis in the UK. Patients typically present with kidney impairment and progress to end-stage renal disease over a median time of 4.6 years. METHODS Six patients presented with proteinuria, hypertension, and/or lower limb edema and underwent detailed clinical and laboratory investigations. RESULTS A novel FGA gene mutation was identified in each case: 2 frameshift mutations F521Sfs*27 and G519Efs*30 and 4 single base substitutions G555F, E526K, E524K, R554H. In 5 subjects, extensive amyloid deposits were found solely within the glomeruli, which stained specifically with antibodies to fibrinogen A alpha chain, and in one of these cases, we found coexistent fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease. One patient was diagnosed with light-chain amyloidosis after a bone marrow examination revealed a small clonal plasma cell population, and laser microdissection of the amyloid deposits followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry identified kappa light chain as the fibril protein. DISCUSSION We report 6 novel mutations in the FGA gene: 5 were associated with renal fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis and 1 was found to be incidental to light-chain amyloid deposits discovered in a patient with a plasma cell dyscrasia. Clinical awareness and suspicion of hereditary amyloidosis corroborated by genetic analysis and adequate typing using combined immunohistochemistry and laser microdissection and mass spectrometry is valuable to avoid misdiagnosis, especially when a family history of amyloidosis is absent."

Nowadays, a novel technique LMD/MS technique or laser microdissection combined with mass spectrometry help to diagnose amyloidosis. Amyloidosis of the kidney is typically classified as being either one of two types: AL or AA. Less common is the hereditary amyloidosis.

The prognosis of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma remains dismal in spite of the current concomitant chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide.

In the present study, we evaluated in vitro and in vivo the antitumor effects of combination therapy of cilengitide with belotecan, a camptothecin derivate, to treat experimental glioblastoma. The therapeutic effects of the drugs on the U87MG and U251MG human glioblastoma cell lines were assessed using in vitro cell viability and apoptosis assays. The combination treatment group with cilengitide and belotecan enhanced the cytotoxic effects to the glioblastoma cell lines and increased the apoptosis of the tumor cells compared to monotherapy with either drug alone in vitro. Nude mice with established U87MG glioblastoma were assigned to the following four groups: control, cilengitide, belotecan and combination treatment. The volume of tumors and length of survival were also measured. Animals in the combination therapy group demonstrated a significant reduction of tumor volume and an increase in survival (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry revealed a decrease in angiogenesis by cilengitide and an increase in apoptosis by cilengitide and belotecan in vivo.

Preclinical studies demonstrate antiangiogenic activity and anti-invasive activity in a number of glioma models. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tumor delivery of cilengitide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Patients with recurrent glioblastoma who require a surgical resection for optimal clinical care received 3 intravenous doses of cilengitide at either 500 or 2000 mg (day -8, -4, -1) prior to undergoing tumor resection with corresponding blood samples for plasma to tumor comparisons.

Preclinical data as well as anecdotal clinical observations indicate that anti-angiogenic treatment may result in altered patterns of tumor progression.

Thirty patients from the experimental treatment arm of the EORTC/NCIC pivotal TMZ trial served as a reference. MRIcro software was used to map location and extent of initial preoperative and recurrent tumors on MRI of both groups into the same stereotaxic space which were then analyzed using an automated tool of image analysis. Clinical and outcome data of the cilengitide-treated patients were similar to those of the EORTC/NCIC trial except for a higher proportion of patients with a methylated O(6)-methylguanyl-DNA-methyltransferase gene promoter. Analysis of recurrence pattern revealed neither a difference in the size of the recurrent tumor nor in the distance of the recurrences from the preoperative tumor location between groups. Overall frequencies of distant recurrences were 20 % in the reference group and 19 % (4/21 patients) in the cilengitide group.

The Children's Oncology Group ACNS0621 study thus evaluated whether cilengitide is active as a single agent in the treatment of children with refractory high-grade glioma (HGG). Secondary objectives were to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of cilengitide in this population. METHODS Cilengitide (1800 mg/m(2)/dose intravenous) was administered twice weekly until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Thirty patients (age range, 1.1-20.3 years) were enrolled, of whom 24 were evaluable for the primary response end point. RESULTS Toxicity was infrequent and mild, with the exception of one episode of grade 2 pain possibly related to cilengitide. Two intratumoral hemorrhages were reported, but only one (grade 2) was deemed to be possibly related to cilengitide and was in the context of disease progression. One patient with GBM received cilengitide for 20 months and remains alive with continuous stable disease. There were no other responders, with median time to tumor progression of 28 days (range, 11-114 days). Twenty-one of the 24 evaluable patients died, with a median time from enrollment to death of 172 days (range, 28-325 days). The 3 patients alive at the time of this report had a follow-up time of 37, 223, and 1068 days, respectively.

Data from phase 2 trials suggest that it has antitumour activity as a single agent in recurrent glioblastoma and in combination with standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (particularly in tumours with methylated MGMT promoter). We aimed to assess cilengitide combined with temozolomide chemoradiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with methylated MGMT promoter. METHODS In this multicentre, open-label, phase 3 study, we investigated the efficacy of cilengitide in patients from 146 study sites in 25 countries. Eligible patients (newly diagnosed, histologically proven supratentorial glioblastoma, methylated MGMT promoter, and age \u226518 years) were stratified for prognostic Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class and geographic region and centrally randomised in a 1:1 ratio with interactive voice response system to receive temozolomide chemoradiotherapy with cilengitide 2000 mg intravenously twice weekly (cilengitide group) or temozolomide chemoradiotherapy alone (control group). Patients and investigators were unmasked to treatment allocation. Maintenance temozolomide was given for up to six cycles, and cilengitide was given for up to 18 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary endpoint was overall survival. We analysed survival outcomes by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00689221. FINDINGS Overall, 3471 patients were screened. Of these patients, 3060 had tumour MGMT status tested; 926 patients had a methylated MGMT promoter, and 545 were randomly assigned to the cilengitide (n=272) or control groups (n=273) between Oct 31, 2008, and May 12, 2011. Median overall survival was 26\u00b73 months (95% CI 23\u00b78-28\u00b78) in the cilengitide group and 26\u00b73 months (23\u00b79-34\u00b77) in the control group (hazard ratio 1\u00b702, 95% CI 0\u00b781-1\u00b729, p=0\u00b786). None of the predefined clinical subgroups showed a benefit from cilengitide. We noted no overall additional toxic effects with cilengitide treatment.

OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of the angiogenesis inhibitor Cilengitide (EMD 121974) on glioblastoma growth and associated angiogenesis in the brains of nude mice. METHODS Human glioblastoma cells (10 U87MG cells) in 1 mul of medium were stereotactically injected during a 20-minute period into the caudate/putamen of nude mice. The mice were intraperitoneally treated daily with Cilengitide or solvent (control) beginning 5 days after tumor injection. The mice were sacrificed from 1 hour to 63 days after tumor implantation and examined for tumor size, vascularity, apoptosis, and cell replication. RESULTS This injection technique resulted in a highly reproducible, localized, spherical tumor cell placement in the parenchyma without reflux into the subarachnoid space or penetration into the ventricle. Serial brain sections showed the tumor size remained unchanged at 1 to 2 mm for approximately 30 to 40 days. Thereafter, the control tumors showed exponential growth to a volume of 120 mm, with death of the mice at approximately 8 to 9 weeks. Serial staining for Ki-67, a marker for cell replication, and CD31, an indicator for angiogenesis, demonstrated an increase in proportion to the growth of the tumor. In contrast, the tumor volume in Cilengitide-treated mice stayed unchanged at 1 to 2 mm during the entire length of the experiment, with staining for Ki-67 and CD31 remaining low. CONCLUSION This standardized brain tumor model is highly reproducible and useful for testing new treatment regimens.

Cilengitide and other integrin-targeting therapeutics have preclinical activity against many cancer subtypes including glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadliest CNS tumor. Cilengitide is active against orthotopic GBM xenografts and can augment radiotherapy and chemotherapy in these models. In Phase I and II GBM trials, cilengitide and the combination of cilengitide with standard temozolomide and radiation demonstrate consistent antitumor activity and a favorable safety profile. Cilengitide is currently under evaluation in a pivotal, randomized Phase III study (Cilengitide in Combination With Temozolomide and Radiotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Phase III Randomized Clinical Trial [CENTRIC]) for newly diagnosed GBM. In addition, randomized controlled Phase II studies with cilengitide are ongoing for non-small-cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Cilengitide is the first integrin inhibitor in clinical Phase III development for oncology."

Integrins are critical intermediaries in a wide spectrum of cancer cell activities and thus represent a highly attractive target in oncology therapy.

In this review, we will focus on cilengitide, an RGD pentapeptide inhibitor of \u03b1 V integrins. Although several integrin inhibitors are under clinical evaluation, cilengitide is the most clinically advanced and is emerging as a prototype for this class of anticancer therapy. A foundation of encouraging preclinical studies led to a well-designed clinical development plan that culminated in a pivotal phase III study of cilengitide in combination with radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. Accrual to this study recently completed, while phase II studies of cilengitide are ongoing for head and neck cancer as well as lung cancer. Important future considerations for cilengitide and other integrin-targeting agents will likely include the identification of optimal combinatorial regimens and the delineation of biomarkers associated with efficacy."

BACKGROUND Survival outcomes for patients with glioblastoma remain poor, particularly for patients with unmethylated O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter. This phase II, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial investigated the efficacy and safety of 2 dose regimens of the selective integrin inhibitor cilengitide combined with standard chemoradiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and an unmethylated MGMT promoter. METHODS Overall, 265 patients were randomized (1:1:1) to standard cilengitide (2000 mg 2\u00d7/wk; n = 88), intensive cilengitide (2000 mg 5\u00d7/wk during wk 1-6, thereafter 2\u00d7/wk; n = 88), or a control arm (chemoradiotherapy alone; n = 89). Cilengitide was administered intravenously in combination with daily temozolomide (TMZ) and concomitant radiotherapy (RT; wk 1-6), followed by TMZ maintenance therapy (TMZ/RT\u2192TMZ). The primary endpoint was overall survival; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, pharmacokinetics, and safety and tolerability. RESULTS Median overall survival was 16.3 months in the standard cilengitide arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.686; 95% CI: 0.484, 0.972; P = .032) and 14.5 months in the intensive cilengitide arm (HR, 0.858; 95% CI: 0.612, 1.204; P = .3771) versus 13.4 months in the control arm. Median progression-free survival assessed per independent review committee was 5.6 months (HR, 0.822; 95% CI: 0.595, 1.134) and 5.9 months (HR, 0.794; 95% CI: 0.575, 1.096) in the standard and intensive cilengitide arms, respectively, versus 4.1 months in the control arm. Cilengitide was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS Standard and intensive cilengitide dose regimens were well tolerated in combination with TMZ/RT\u2192TMZ. Inconsistent overall survival and progression-free survival outcomes and a limited sample size did not allow firm conclusions regarding clinical efficacy in this exploratory phase II study."

The principal symptom of subjects suffering from King-Kopetzky syndrome is a perceived difficulty in recognizing and understanding speech in noisy backgrounds. For some patients, minor disturbances in auditory function, e.g. a deteriorated signal-to-noise ratio for speech, can be demonstrated; for others, all measurements of hearing are normal. A conceptual framework developed for the analysis of communication disorders is applied to King-Kopetzky syndrome in the present article. The usefulness of the framework is evaluated, and an extended system for the analysis of King-Kopetzky syndrome patients is suggested. It is emphasized that changes in demands resulting from external conditions and altered perception and evaluation of the conditions may generate the symptoms. A change in the subjects' desired self-image (preferendum) and a change in social role, new, unfamiliar vocabulary, as well as minor dysfunctions in peripheral and central auditory processing, might generate the characteristic features of the syndrome. The framework is related to the current literature, and arguments for the usefulness of the framework in the planning of support and rehabilitation are presented. Several new questions are generated for further analysis of King-Kopetzky syndrome."

In a study on 110 consecutive patients with King-Kopezky syndrome referred to the Welsh Hearing Institute, subjects were subdivided into seven subcategories based on sensitized measures of auditory dysfunction and on psychological assessment. These were: (1) middle ear dysfunction; (2) mild cochlear pathology; (3) central/medial olivocochlear efferent system (MOCS) auditory dysfunction; (4) purely psychological problems; (5) multiple auditory pathologies; (6) combined auditory dysfunction and psychological problems and (7) unknown.

The significantly higher (worse) SHHI scores in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome indicate that this group suffer a considerable degree of speech-hearing disability. In our study, the main findings are that some psychological factors, performance of the sentence in noise test and auditory thresholds are significantly correlated with the SHHI scores. We were unable to find any relationships between the SHHI and frequency resolution or EOAEs. In a multiple stepwise regression, somatic anxiety and the performance of the sentence in noise test are the significant predictors of SHHI scores.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve glycemic control by a reversible inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporters in the renal proximal tubules resulting in increased urinary glucose. This unique mechanism, independent of insulin secretion and beta cell function, has made this class of medication desirable in patients with type 2 diabetes. However in May 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning pertaining to the development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors. DKA associated with SGLT2 inhibitors frequently develops in the absence of hyperglycemia, which makes the diagnosis more challenging. Due to the reversible inhibition of SGLT2 by this class of medication, a quick recovery of glucosuria after cessation of medication is expected. In this article, we present a case of a 50-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes who developed euglycemic DKA after initiating therapy with canagliflozin. This case of DKA associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use was unique due to her hypoglycemic presentation and persistent glucosuria.

Pyricularia oryzae, a blast fungus of gramineous plants, is composed of various host genus-specific pathotypes. The avirulence of an Avena isolate on wheat is conditioned by PWT3 and PWT4. We isolated the third avirulence gene from the Avena isolate and designated it as PWT7. PWT7 was effective as an avirulence gene only at the seedling stage or on leaves. PWT7 homologs were widely distributed in a subpopulation of the Eleusine pathotype and the Lolium pathotype but completely absent in the Triticum pathotype (the wheat blast fungus). The PWT7 homolog found in the Eleusine pathotype was one of the five genes involved in its avirulence on wheat. A comparative analysis of distribution of PWT7 and the other two genes previously identified in the Eleusine pathotype suggested that, in the course of parasitic specialization toward the wheat blast fungus, a common ancestor of the Eleusine, Lolium, Avena, and Triticum pathotypes first lost PWT6, secondly PWT7, and, finally, the function of PWT3. PWT7 or its homologs were located on core chromosomes in Setaria and Eleusine isolates but on supernumerary chromosomes in Lolium and Avena isolates. This is an example of interchromosomal translocations of effector genes between core and supernumerary chromosomes. [Formula: see text] Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

This clone, termed RS-1, is a genomic DNA clone containing at least one highly repeated sequence that is abundant in Avena species containing the C genome. This sequence or a related sequence is also present, but at much reduced levels, in species that do not contain the C genome.

We have also done similar analysis of the Avena genus using a rDNA clone from wheat. The results of these experiments demonstrate that clearly definable C genome-specific markers can be identified with both probes. These molecular probes can be useful in studying the genomic relationships of Avena and can provide some clues as to the origin of the cultivated Avena species. These results can, therefore, provide breeders with directions for the efficient transfer of desirable traits of wild Avena species into commencal varieties."

The cloned DNA fragment was a dispersed repeat present in all Avena species used in this study (A. strigosa, A. clauda, A. vaviloviana, A. magna, and A. sativa). The fragment was sequenced (210 bp) and found to be 69.5% homologous to part of WIS-2-1A, and 60.5% homologous to the leader sequence of BARE-1; both of these elements have been characterized as Ty1-copia-like retrotransposons in wheat and barley, respectively. In situ hybridization of pAvKB30 to diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid oat species revealed that the probe is present on both arms of all chromosomes (A, B, C, and D genomes) but is excluded from their centromeric and nucleolar organizer regions. By using double in situ hybridization in hexaploid A. sativa (ACD genome), pAvKB30 was found to be present in lower copy numbers in C-genome chromosomes compared with A- and D-genome chromosomes. Furthermore, under low stringency conditions, pAvKB30 hybridized on Southern blots containing barley, wheat, rye, and Arrhenatherum DNA. However, under high stringency conditions, it hybridized only on Arrhenatherum DNA, which is considered to be the genus most closely related to Avena.

On the basis of the well-known softening effect of puroindolines in wheat kernel texture, in this study, indolines and their encoding genes are investigated in Avena species at different ploidy levels. Three novel 14 kDa proteins, showing a central hydrophobic domain with four tryptophan residues and here named vromindoline (VIN)-1,2 and 3, were identified. Each VIN protein in diploid oat species was found to be synthesized by a single Vin gene whereas, in hexaploid A. sativa, three Vin-1, three Vin-2 and two Vin-3 genes coding for VIN-1, VIN-2 and VIN-3, respectively, were described and assigned to the A, C or D genomes based on similarity to their counterparts in diploid species. Expression of oat vromindoline transgenes in the extra-hard durum wheat led to accumulation of vromindolines in the endosperm and caused an approximate 50 % reduction of grain hardness, suggesting a central role for vromindolines in causing the extra-soft texture of oat grain. Further, hexaploid oats showed three orthologous genes coding for avenoindolines A and B, with five or three tryptophan residues, respectively, but very low amounts of avenoindolines were found in mature kernels.

Samples were tested by tissue-blot immunoassay (2) using antisera against 7 cereal-infecting viruses: Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), Wheat dwarf virus (WDV), Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), Barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV), Barley yellow striate mosaic virus (BYSMV), Maize streak virus (MSV), and Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). Strong positive reactions against the BYDV-PAV polyclonal antiserum were shown by 43 samples. To confirm, total RNAs from 10 of the positive samples (three bread wheat, three durum wheat, the oat, and one sample each of T. beoticum, T. turgidum, and T. dicoccoides) were submitted to RT-PCR with two primer pairs adapted in part from (3). Primers Luteo1F 5'TTCGGMSARTGGTTGTGGTCCA 3' and YanR-new 5'TGTTGAGGAGTCTACCTATTTNG 3' (adapted from primer YanR (3)) allow the specific amplification of viruses of the genus Luteovirus (including BYDV) while primers Luteo2F 5'TCACSTTCGGRCCGWSTYTWTCAG 3' (adapted from primer Shu2a-F (3)) and YanR-new are specific for the genus Polerovirus (including Cereal yellow dwarf virus, CYDV).

Sequencing of amplification products obtained with the Luteo1F/YanR-new primer pair confirmed the presence of BYDV-PAV in all samples (GenBank JX275850 to JX275857). The Azeri isolates were all similar (0 to 1.7% nucleotide divergence) except for one isolate (JX275855, from T. turgidum, 2.4 to 3.2% divergence). An Azeri BYDV-PAV isolate (JX275851, from bread wheat) showed 100% identity with a Latvian isolate (AJ563414) and with two isolates from Morocco (AJ007929 and AJ007918). These isolates belong to a group of widespread PAV isolates and are 99% identical with isolates from Sweden, the United States, China, France, and New Zealand. Sequencing of products obtained with the Luteo2F/YanR-new primers (JX294311 and JX294312) identified CYDV-RPV. The two Azeri sequences show ~3% nucleotide divergence and their closest relatives in GenBank are a range of CYDV-RPV isolates mostly from the United States, including EF521848 and EF521830, with ~4 to 5% divergence.

BACKGROUND The identification of chromosomes among Avena species have been studied by C-banding and in situ hybridization. However, the complicated results from several cytogenetic nomenclatures for identifying oat chromosomes are often contradictory. A universal karyotyping nomenclature system for precise chromosome identification and comparative evolutionary studies would be essential for genus Avena based on the recently released genome sequences of hexaploid and diploid Avena species. RESULTS Tandem repetitive sequences were predicted and physically located on chromosomal regions of the released Avena sativa OT3098 genome assembly v1. Eight new oligonucleotide (oligo) probes for sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were designed and then applied for chromosome karyotyping on mitotic metaphase spreads of A. brevis, A. nuda, A. wiestii, A. ventricosa, A. fatua, and A. sativa species. We established a high-resolution standard karyotype of A. sativa based on the distinct FISH signals of multiple oligo probes. FISH painting with bulked oligos, based on wheat-barley collinear regions, was used to validate the linkage group assignment for individual A. sativa chromosomes. We integrated our new Oligo-FISH based karyotype system with earlier karyotype nomenclatures through sequential C-banding and FISH methods, then subsequently determined the precise breakage points of some chromosome translocations in A. sativa. CONCLUSIONS This new universal chromosome identification system will be a powerful tool for describing the genetic diversity, chromosomal rearrangements and evolutionary relationships among Avena species by comparative cytogenetic and genomic approaches."

The bone diagnostic instrument (BDI) is being developed with the long-term goal of providing a way for researchers and clinicians to measure bone material properties of human bone in vivo. Such measurements could contribute to the overall assessment of bone fragility in the future. Here, we describe an improved BDI, the Osteoprobe IItrade mark. In the Osteoprobe IItrade mark, the probe assembly, which is designed to penetrate soft tissue, consists of a reference probe (a 22 gauge hypodermic needle) and a test probe (a small diameter, sharpened rod) which slides through the inside of the reference probe. The probe assembly is inserted through the skin to rest on the bone. The distance that the test probe is indented into the bone can be measured relative to the position of the reference probe. At this stage of development, the indentation distance increase (IDI) with repeated cycling to a fixed force appears to best distinguish bone that is more easily fractured from bone that is less easily fractured. Specifically, in three model systems, in which previous mechanical testing and/or tests reported here found degraded mechanical properties such as toughness and postyield strain, the BDI found increased IDI. However, it must be emphasized that, at this time, neither the IDI nor any other mechanical measurement by any technique has been shown clinically to correlate with fracture risk. Further, we do not yet understand the mechanism responsible for determining IDI beyond noting that it is a measure of the continuing damage that results from repeated loading. As such, it is more a measure of plasticity than elasticity in the bone."

BACKGROUND We investigated the validity of probe-to-bone testing in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis in a selected subgroup of patients clinically suspected of having diabetic foot osteomyelitis. METHODS Between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2008, inpatients and outpatients with a diabetic foot ulcer were prospectively evaluated, and those having a clinical diagnosis of foot infection and at least one of the osteomyelitis clinical suspicion criteria were consecutively included in this study. RESULTS Sixty-five patients met the inclusion criteria and were prospectively enrolled in the study. Forty-nine patients (75.4%) were hospitalized, and the remaining 16 (24.6%) were followed as outpatients. Osteomyelitis was diagnosed in 39 patients (60.0%). Probe-to-bone test results were positive in 30 patients (46.1%). The positive predictive value for the probe-to-bone test was fairly high (87%), but the negative predictive value was only 62%. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 66% and 84%, respectively. White blood cell counts and mean C-reactive protein levels did not statistically significantly differ between groups. However, erythrocyte sedimentation rates greater than 70 mm/h reached statistical significance between groups. Wound area and depth were not found to be statistically significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS Positive probe-to-bone test results and erythrocyte sedimentation rates greater than 70 mm/h provide some support for the diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis, but it is not strong; magnetic resonance imaging or bone biopsy will probably be required in cases of doubt."

AIMS To investigate the accuracy of the sequential combination of the probe-to-bone test and plain X-rays for diagnosing osteomyelitis in the foot of patients with diabetes. METHODS We prospectively compiled data on a series of 338 patients with diabetes with 356 episodes of foot infection who were hospitalized in the Diabetic Foot Unit of La Paloma Hospital from 1 October 2002 to 31 April 2010. For each patient we did a probe-to-bone test at the time of the initial evaluation and then obtained plain X-rays of the involved foot. All patients with positive results on either the probe-to-bone test or plain X-ray underwent an appropriate surgical procedure, which included obtaining a bone specimen that was processed for histology and culture. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios of the procedures, using the histopathological diagnosis of osteomyelitis as the criterion standard. RESULTS Overall, 72.4% of patients had histologically proven osteomyelitis, 85.2% of whom had positive bone culture. The performance characteristics of both the probe-to-bone test and plain X-rays were excellent. The sequential diagnostic approach had a sensitivity of 0.97, specificity of 0.92, positive predictive value of 0.97, negative predictive value of 0.93, positive likelihood ratio of 12.8 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.02. Only 6.6% of patients with negative results on both diagnostic studies had osteomyelitis. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians seeing patients in a setting similar to ours (specialized diabetic foot unit with a high prevalence of osteomyelitis) can confidently diagnose diabetic foot osteomyelitis when either the probe-to-bone test or a plain X-ray, or especially both, are positive."

OBJECTIVE To compare the diagnostic characteristics of tests used for a prompt diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot, using bone histology as the criterion standard. The tests assessed were probe-to-bone (PTB), clinical signs of infection, radiography signs of osteomyelitis, and ulcer specimen culture. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A prospective study was performed on patients with foot ulcers referred to our diabetic foot clinic. Ulcer infection was diagnosed by recording clinical signs of infection and taking specimens for culture. The presumptive diagnosis of osteomyelitis was based on these results and the findings of a plain X-ray and PTB test. All patients with a clinical suspicion of bone infection were subjected to surgical treatment of the affected bone. During surgery, bone specimens were obtained for a histological diagnosis of osteomyelitis. RESULTS Over 2.5 years, 210 foot lesions were consecutively examined and 132 of these wounds with clinical suspicion of infection selected as the study sample. Of these, 105 (79.5%) lesions were diagnosed as osteomyelitis. Among the tests compared, the best results were yielded by the PTB test including an efficiency of 94%, sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 78%, positive predictive value of 95%, and negative predictive value of 91% (P < 0.001, \u03ba 0.803); the positive likelihood ratio was 4.41, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.02 (95% CI). CONCLUSIONS In our outpatient population with a high prevalence of osteomyelitis, the PTB test was of greatest diagnostic value, especially for neuropathic ulcers, and proved to be efficient for detecting osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot."

Periodontal disease in dogs is highly prevalent but can only be accurately diagnosed by performing an anesthetized oral examination with periodontal probing and dental radiography. In this study, 114 dogs had a visual awake examination of the oral cavity and were administered an oral-fluid thiol-detection test prior to undergoing a a full-mouth anesthetized oral examination and digital dental radiographs. The results show the visual awake examination underestimated the presence and severity of active periodontal disease. The thiol-detection test was superior to the visual awake examination at detecting the presence and severity of active periodontal disease and was an indicator of progression toward alveolar bone loss. The thiol-detection test detected active periodontal disease at early stages of development, before any visual cues were present, indicating the need for intervention to prevent periodontal bone loss. Early detection is important because without intervention, dogs with gingivitis (active periodontal disease) progress to irreversible periodontal bone loss (stage 2+). As suggested in the current AAHA guidelines, a thiol-detection test administered in conjunction with the visual awake examination during routine wellness examinations facilitates veterinarian-client communication and mitigates under-diagnosis of periodontal disease and underutilization of dental services.

Accurate detection of bone resorption is extremely important in the orthodontic treatment process as it can provide a basis for clinical treatment strategies. Recently, pH-responsive fluorescence probes have received tremendous attention in bone resorption monitoring owing to their high sensitivity, good specificity, and in situ and real-time detection capabilities, but there are still some shortcomings like the increase in the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw by use of bisphosphonate as the bone-targeting moiety and the insufficient monitoring accuracy due to susceptibility to interference. Herein, we designed and synthesized a near-infrared ratiometric hemicyanine-based pH fluorescence probe (Hcy-Asp6) with fluorescence-imaging and pH-determining capabilities, and bone targetability for more reliably and safely monitoring the bone resorption in orthodontic treatment. In vitro optical performance tests of Hcy-Asp6 revealed that the probe had high sensitivity, excellent photostability, reversibility, and strong resistance to interference, and the probe suggested excellent bone-binding ability and biocompatibility in the bone-targeting evaluation and the cytotoxicity test. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo bone resorption monitoring assays demonstrated that this probe can detect bone resorption by fluorescence imaging and quantitative monitoring of pH associated with the bone resorption. Thus, the results indicated that this probe possessing bone targetability and accurate bone resorption-monitoring capability has an extraordinarily great clinical potential to be employed for real-time monitoring of bone resorption in orthodontic treatment and could also serve as a reference in bone resorption monitoring for other bone resorption-related diseases."

BACKGROUND Doxycycline is one of the recommended antibiotics for treating erythema migrans (EM). Since EM predominantly occurs during summer, the potential of doxycycline to induce photosensitivity is of concern. In studies on the efficacy of doxycycline for treating relatively small numbers of patients with EM, the reported frequency of photosensitivity has varied from none to 15%. The aim of this study was to elucidate the frequency and clinical symptoms of doxycycline-induced photosensitivity in a large cohort of patients with EM treated in a single medical centre. METHODS Prospectively collected data on adverse events were analysed in adult patients with EM treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10-15 days. RESULTS Photosensitivity reactions ranging from itching and burning sensations to transient mild erythema of sun-exposed skin were documented in 16/858 (1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.0%) patients and appeared from June to October with highest frequency in July. These adverse events were more frequent in patients treated for 14 or 15 days (16/750 [2.1%]; 95% CI 1.2-3.4%) than in those treated for 10 days (0/108 [0%]; 95% CI 0.0-3.4%); however, the difference was not significant (P = 0.24).

Of the 16 patients who developed photosensitivity, 13 did not adhere to the recommendation to avoid sun exposure. None of the patients had any long-term sequelae of photosensitivity. CONCLUSIONS Photosensitivity reactions in adult patients with EM treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10-15 days occurred rarely, were not severe, and had no long-term sequelae.

BACKGROUND Therapeutic guidelines for treatment of late manifestations of Lyme borreliosis have not yet become well established. Patients with symptoms suggesting central nervous system involvement are often treated with courses of intravenous ceftriaxone. This is an expensive treatment approach with potentially severe side effects. We compared the efficacy, side effects and costs of doxycycline and ceftriaxone in the treatment of such patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Adult patients qualified for the study if they had nonspecific symptoms suggesting central nervous system involvement for more than six months (but without overt clinical signs of the involvement), had positive serum borrelial antibody titers and/or erythema migrans prior to the onset of symptoms, had not been previously treated with antibiotics and did not have pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. Patients were given either 100 mg of oral doxycycline twice daily for 4 weeks (23 patients) or 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone daily for 2 weeks followed by 100 mg of doxycycline twice daily for another 2 weeks (23 patients). Clinical outcome was assessed during a 12-month follow-up period. RESULTS Improvement in the frequency and/or the intensity of symptoms was reported by more than two-thirds of the 46 patients enrolled in the study. The two treatment regimens were found to be correspondingly effective. Photosensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were noted more often among patients receiving doxycycline than in those receiving ceftriaxone. Treatment with doxycycline proved to be much cheaper than with ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS In patients with previously untreated chronic Lyme borreliosis with symptoms suggesting central nervous system involvement but without overt clinical signs of it, and without pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, treatment with doxycycline is as effective as with ceftriaxone. Treatment with doxycycline is cheap and relatively safe, but gastrointestinal symptoms and photosensitivity reactions can be expected more often than with ceftriaxone."

Chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) is an uncommon, eczematous photosensitive eruption affecting predominantly elderly men and to which drug-induced photosensitivity may sometimes appear clinically identical. This retrospective study compares the monochromatic irradiation results in 11 patients with CAD and 14 patients with drug-induced photosensitivity, to assess whether such testing is useful in the differentiation of these two conditions. Thus, the action spectra of the drug photosensitivity patients were plotted and compared with those of 12 nonphotosensitive control patients: 10 patients were found to be photosensitive in the UVA range; the implicated drugs included quinine, sparfloxacin, amiodarone, doxycycline, mefenamic acid, nalidixic acid, fenbrufen, diclofenac, enalapril, diltiazem and prochlorperazine maleate. One patient on doxycycline was photosensitive in both the UVA and UVB ranges. The remaining three patients were not tested until after discontinuation of their drug and their light tests were then normal. In the CAD group, five patients were photosensitive in the UVA, UVB and visible light ranges and six were photosensitive in the UVA and UVB ranges. Comparison of the mean minimal erythema dose responses then demonstrated dissociation of the drug-induced from the CAD group in the UVB region; the result was statistically significant. This suggests that UVA-sensitivity dissociated from UVB-sensitivity is a relative indicator of drug-induced photosensitivity and monochromatic irradiation testing may therefore be helpful in the differentiation of these two disorders."

OBJECTIVES Many patients undergoing long-term doxycycline treatment do not regularly take their treatment because of photosensitivity.

METHODS We tested sera and hair samples from patients treated with doxycycline by a suitable ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) based assay. RESULTS We estimated that the speed of hair growth is roughly 1.25 cm per month and we were able to determine doxycycline levels over a 6-month period. We tested 14 patients treated with doxycycline and we found similar levels of doxycycline in the serum and the hair samples representing the last 4 months. Linear regression analysis revealed that the level of doxycycline in the serum remained stable over time (p = 0.7) but the level of doxycycline in the hair decreased significantly over time (p = 0.03) indicating a degradation of this molecule in the hair. We detected two patients who did not have antibiotic in the hair, indicating a lack of compliance that was also confirmed by interview.

A total of 232 patients with physician-documented erythema migrans were treated orally for 20 days with either cefuroxime axetil, 500 mg twice daily (119 patients), or doxycycline, 100 mg three times daily (113 patients), and clinical evaluations were conducted during treatment (8 to 12 days) and at 1 to 5 days and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months posttreatment. Patients were assessed as to the resolution of erythema migrans and of the signs and symptoms related to early Lyme disease as well as to the prevention of late Lyme disease. A satisfactory clinical outcome (success or improvement) was achieved in 90 of 100 (90%) evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil and in 89 of 94 (95%) patients treated with doxycycline (difference, -5%; 95% confidence interval, -12 to 3%). Patients with paresthesia, arthralgia, or irritability at enrollment were at higher risk for an unsatisfactory clinical outcome at 1 month posttreatment.

Twenty-eight percent of patients treated with doxycycline and 17% of those treated with cefuroxime axetil had one or more drug-related adverse events (P = 0.041). Doxycycline was associated with more photosensitivity reactions (6% compared with 0% for patients treated with cefuroxime axetil; P=0.006), and cefuroxime axetil was associated with more cases of diarrhea (5% compared with 0% for patients treated with doxycycline; P=0.030). Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions occurred in 12% of the patients in each treatment group. In summary, cefuroxime axetil is well tolerated and appears to be equally as effective as doxycycline in the treatment of early Lyme disease and in preventing the subsequent development of late Lyme disease."

The mainstay of management is prevention, including informing patients of the possibility of increased photosensitivity as well as the use of appropriate sun protective measures. Once a photosensitivity reaction has occurred, it may be necessary to discontinue the culprit medication and treat the reaction with corticosteroids. For certain medications, long-term surveillance may be indicated because of a higher risk of developing melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma at sites of earlier photosensitivity reactions. A large number of medications have been implicated as causes of photosensitivity, many with convincing clinical and scientific supporting evidence. We review the medical literature regarding the evidence for the culpability of each drug, including the results of phototesting, photopatch testing and rechallenge testing. Amiodarone, chlorpromazine, doxycycline, hydrochlorothiazide, nalidixic acid, naproxen, piroxicam, tetracycline, thioridazine, vemurafenib and voriconazole are among the most consistently implicated and warrant the most precaution by both the physician and patient."

BACKGROUND No case of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura with Doege-Potter syndrome has been reported in China. This study was to report a rare repeatedly recurrent case of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura with Doege-Potter syndrome diagnosed in China and a three-decade literature review of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura with Doege-Potter syndrome worldwide. CASE PRESENTATION A rare case of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura with Doege-Potter syndrome was diagnosed in 2005 with follow-up to 2011. All medical records were collected and literature of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura with Doege-Potter syndrome from 1979 to 2011 was obtained through Medline. This typical case, diagnosed and confirmed by histopathologic results, was a 72-year-old Chinese woman who had a complaint of night sweat for a month. A localized mass 12 cm \u00d7 11 cm \u00d7 8 cm in size was found associated with pleural effusion in her left low chest cavity, and blood tests showed severe hypoglycemia. Removal of the mass solved the hypoglycemia. The case was repeatedly recurrent in April, 2010 and March, 2011 and had no signs of recurrence up to the end of 2011 after surgery. A review of 45 cases of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura with Doege-Potter syndrome compared and summarized clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes by benign and malignant tumor nature. CONCLUSIONS Incidence of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura with Doege-Potter syndrome is similar between genders. There are no significant differences in clinical characteristics between benign and malignant cases. Surgery is the first effective treatment for solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura with Doege-Potter syndrome and the completeness of the initial resection is the key to preventing recurrence. Routine follow-up examinations are recommended for early detection of recurrence."

UNLABELLED INTRODUCTION Doege-Potter syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia secondary to a solitary fibrous tumor. This tumor causes hypoglycemia by the secretion of a prohormone form of insulin-like growth factor II. We describe the diagnosis and management of Doege-Potter syndrome and the use of transarterial chemoembolization in a patient with a malignant extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor. CASE PRESENTATION Our patient was a 64-year-old Caucasian woman who initially presented with urinary incontinence and was found to have a 14.5\u00d79.0\u00d79.0cm retroperitoneal solitary fibrous tumor compressing her bladder. Her tumor was surgically resected but recurred with multiple hepatic metastatic lesions. The hepatic metastases progressed despite systemic chemotherapy and treatment with doxorubicin transarterial chemoembolization. Her course was complicated by the development of recurrent fasting hypoglycemia, most likely secondary to Doege-Potter syndrome. Her hypoglycemia was managed with corticosteroid therapy and frequent scheduled nutrient intake overnight. CONCLUSIONS The rarity of hepatic solitary fibrous tumors and consequent lack of controlled trials make this report significant in that it describes the diagnostic approach to Doege-Potter syndrome, describes our experience with the use of doxorubicin transarterial chemoembolization, and presents management options for tumor-associated hypoglycemia in the case of extensive disease not amenable to surgical resection."

The complement system regulator CD55 was initially found to carry the Cromer blood group system antigens, and its complete loss of function was subsequently revealed to cause a severe monogenic gastrointestinal syndrome characterized by protein-losing enteropathy and susceptibility to venous thrombosis. Here we present homozygosity to the CD55 c.596C>T; p.Ser199Leu variant, which was previously described as the Cromer Dr(a-) genotype, in two Bukharan Jewish CD55-deficiency patients with variable disease severity. We confirm that this missense variant causes aberrant splicing and deletion of 44 bp in exon 5, leading to premature termination and low expression of the CD55 protein. Furthermore, Patient 1 exhibited a mildly abnormal B cell immunophenotyping profile. By population screening we established that this variant is highly prevalent in the Bukharan Jewish population, with a carrier frequency of 1:17, suggesting that many similar patients are un- or mis-diagnosed. The phenotypic variability, ranging from abdominal pain when eating a high-fat diet to the full CD55-deficiency phenotype, is likely related to modifiers affecting the proportion of the variant that is able to escape aberrant splicing. Establishing the diagnosis of CD55-deficiency in a timely manner, even in patients with milder symptoms, may have a critical effect on their management and quality-of-life since treatment with the complement inhibitor eculizumab is highly effective in ameliorating disease manifestations. Awareness of founder mutations within certain populations can further guide genetic testing and prevent a diagnostic odyssey, by placing this CD55 variant high on the differential diagnosis."

Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) or Waldmann's disease was described in 1961 as an important cause of protein-losing enteropathy (PLE). PIL can be the sole finding in rare individuals or occur as part of a multisystemic genetic syndrome. Although genetic etiologies of many lymphatic dysplasia syndromes associated with PIL have been identified, the pathogenesis of isolated PIL (with no associated syndromic features) remains unknown. Familial cases and occurrence at birth suggest genetic etiologies in certain cases. Recently, CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and PLE (the CHAPLE syndrome) has been identified as a monogenic form of PIL. Surprisingly, loss of CD55, a key regulator of complement system leads to a predominantly gut condition. Similarly to other complement disorders, namely paroxysmal nocturnal and hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), CHAPLE disease involves pathogenic cross-activation of the coagulation system, predisposing individuals to severe thrombosis. The observation that complement system is overly active in CHAPLE disease introduced a novel concept into the management of PLE; anti-complement therapy. While CD55 deficiency constitutes a treatable subgroup in the larger pool of patients with isolated PIL, the etiology remains to be identified in the remaining patients with intact CD55."

METHODS We studied 11 patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea caused by early-onset protein-losing enteropathy with primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, edema due to hypoproteinemia, malabsorption, and less frequently, bowel inflammation, recurrent infections, and angiopathic thromboembolic disease; the disorder followed an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify gene variants. We evaluated the function of CD55 in patients' cells, which we confirmed by means of exogenous induction of expression of CD55. RESULTS We identified homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding CD55 (decay-accelerating factor), which lead to loss of protein expression. Patients' T lymphocytes showed increased complement activation causing surface deposition of complement and the generation of soluble C5a. Costimulatory function and cytokine modulation by CD55 were defective. Genetic reconstitution of CD55 or treatment with a complement-inhibitory therapeutic antibody reversed abnormal complement activation. CONCLUSIONS CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) results when cells have a somatic defect in the synthesis of GPI anchors and lack CD55 and CD59, as well as CD52. Several patients treated with Campath developed PNH-like symptoms with hemolysis and thrombosis.

Thereafter we instituted a screening program for the presence of CD55/59 levels in all pretransplant patients. Our results show that 17.3% of all pretransplant samples contained abnormal (9.7% of samples) or slightly abnormal (7.6% of samples) levels of granulocytes deficient in CD55 or CD59.

Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a feature of ischemic acute renal failure and it impacts both short- and long-term graft survival after kidney transplantation. Complement activation has been implicated in renal IRI, but its mechanism of action is uncertain and the determinants of complement activation during IRI remain poorly understood. We engineered mice deficient in two membrane complement regulatory proteins, CD55 and CD59, and used them to investigate the role of these endogenous complement inhibitors in renal IRI. CD55-deficient (CD55(-/-)), but not CD59-deficient (CD59(-/-)), mice exhibited increased renal IRI as indicated by significantly elevated blood urea nitrogen levels, histological scores, and neutrophil infiltration. Remarkably, although CD59 deficiency alone was inconsequential, CD55/CD59 double deficiency greatly exacerbated IRI. Severe IRI in CD55(-/-)CD59(-/-) mice was accompanied by endothelial deposition of C3 and the membrane attack complex (MAC) and medullary capillary thrombosis. Complement depletion in CD55(-/-)CD59(-/-) mice with cobra venom factor prevented these effects. Thus, CD55 and CD59 act synergistically to inhibit complement-mediated renal IRI, and abrogation of their function leads to MAC-induced microvascular injury and dysfunction that may exacerbate the initial ischemic assault. Our findings suggest a rationale for anti-complement therapies aimed at preventing microvascular injury during ischemia reperfusion, and the CD55(-/-)CD59(-/-) mouse provides a useful animal model in this regard."

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorder characterized by a partial or complete deficiency of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane proteins, which leads to intravascular hemolysis. The loss of CD55 and CD59, two GPI-anchored proteins on red blood cell surfaces, from mutations in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) gene, causes unrestricted proliferation of complement activation. The loss of CD59 especially leads to 'paroxysms' of acute intravascular hemolysis during events of stress. Extravascular hemolysis also occurs without CD55 as the accumulation of C3 on red blood cell surfaces leads to their destruction by the reticuloendothelial system. Diagnosis of PNH relies primarily on clinical presentation and flow cytometry assays used to detect the GPI-anchored proteins, CD55 and CD59; however, fluorescein-labeled proaerolysin variant (FLAER) is seen to have a significant advantage over CD55 and CD59. Typical symptoms of the disorder include fatigue, shortness of breath, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain and bone marrow failure. Thrombosis also occurs secondary to nitric oxide (NO) deficiency, release of procoagulants, increased tissue factor and reduced fibrinolysis. The classification of PNH is subdivided into three types: classical, PNH with another bone marrow disorder and subclinical PNH. Management of hemolysis, thrombosis and pancytopenia is based on the pathogenesis involved. Inhibition of complement in the form of humanized monoclonal antibody against complement C5 (eculizumab) is seen as an emerging treatment option, while stem cell/bone marrow transplant may also be offered. We present a rare case of PNH with bilateral renal vein thrombosis, who was diagnosed with classical PNH on clinical presentation and flow cytometry. He was initially offered bone marrow transplantation but was lost to follow-up and later presented with bilateral renal vein thrombosis.

OBJECTIVES Loss of the complement inhibitor CD55 leads to a syndrome of early-onset protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), associated with intestinal lymphangiectasia and susceptibility to large-vein thrombosis. The in vitro and short-term treatment benefits of eculizumab (C5-inhibitor) therapy for CD55-deficiency have been previously demonstrated. Here we present the 18-months treatment outcomes for 3 CD55-deficiency patients with sustained therapeutic response. METHODS Three CD55-deficiency patients received off-label eculizumab treatment. Clinical and laboratory treatment outcomes included frequency and consistency of bowl movements, weight, patient/parent reports of overall well-being, and serum albumin and total protein levels. Membrane attack complex deposition on leukocytes was tested by flow cytometry, before and during eculizumab treatment. RESULTS Marked clinical improvement was noted in all 3 patients with resolution of PLE manifestations, that is, diarrhea, edema, malabsorption, overall well-being, growth, and quality of life. In correlation with the clinical observations, we observed progress in all laboratory outcome parameters, including increase in albumin and total protein levels, and up to 80% reduction in membrane attack complex deposition on leukocytes (P < 0.001). The progress persisted over 18 months of treatment without any severe adverse events. CONCLUSIONS CD55-deficiency patients present with early-onset diarrhea, edema, severe hypoalbuminemia, abdominal pain, and malnutrition. Targeted therapy with the terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab has positive clinical and laboratory outcomes in PLE related to CD55 loss-of-function mutations, previously a life-threatening condition.

Despite the importance of the complement system, the exact role of each component has been overlooked because the complement system was thought to be a nonspecific humoral immune mechanism that worked against pathogens. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF or CD55) is a known inhibitor of the complement system and has recently attracted substantial attention due to its role in various diseases, such as cancer, protein-losing enteropathy, and malaria. Some protein-losing enteropathy cases are caused by CD55 deficiency, which leads to complement hyperactivation, malabsorption, and angiopathic thrombosis. In addition, CD55 has been reported to be an essential host receptor for infection by the malaria parasite. Moreover, CD55 is a ligand of the seven-span transmembrane receptor CD97. Since CD55 is present in various cells, the functional role of CD55 has been expanded by showing that CD55 is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, malaria, protein-losing enteropathy, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and autoimmune diseases. This review summarizes the current understanding of CD55 and the role of CD55 in these diseases. It also provides insight into the development of novel drugs for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases associated with CD55."

Shrinking lung syndrome is a rare complication of systemic lupus erythematosus; its impact on sleep-disordered breathing is not well understood. We describe a case of a 36-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus experiencing shrinking lung syndrome and frequent pain crises. We review manifestations of her disease during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement sleep. Shrinking lung syndrome with its restrictive physiology and associated diaphragmatic myopathy is expected to decrease minute ventilation during NREM and rapid eye movement sleep. Normalization of respiratory rate during NREM, as opposed to rapid eye movement and awake state, should alert clinicians to dysfunctional breathing that is suppressed in NREM when cortical breathing is overridden by involuntary breathing. Recognition of dysfunctional breathing disorders by sleep providers is important for addressing all contributors to dyspnea in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus; polysomnogram can be a valuable tool in detecting incongruent ventilation parameters that deviate from expected NREM and rapid eye movement norms and point to dysfunctional breathing disorders. Abnormalities in respiratory rate and gas exchange that improve or vanish in NREM sleep can serve as an additional diagnostic clue of dysfunctional breathing disorders. CITATION Saleh D, Loewen A.

Tuberculosis is responsible for more then 2 million deaths worldwide each year and vies with HIV as the world's most fatal infectious disease. In many developing countries, attempts to control the spread of infection rely solely on identification and treatment of those with active disease, ignoring subclinical infection. However, in developed countries, large efforts are also expended to identify and give prophylactic drugs to people with latent tuberculosis infection. Until recently, the 100-year-old tuberculin skin test (Mantoux) has been the only available diagnostic test for latent tuberculosis infection, despite its many well-known limitations. Advances in scientific knowledge have led to the development of tests for tuberculosis that measure the production of interferon-gamma by T-cells stimulated in vitro with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens. These interferon-gamma tests are highly specific and unaffected by prior Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccination or immune reactivity to most atypical mycobacteria. They are more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in detecting people with active tuberculosis, and their results correlate more closely with M. tuberculosis exposure risk factors than the tuberculin skin test in people likely to have latent tuberculosis infection. Science has caught up with one of the oldest diagnostic tests still in use worldwide, and the adoption of new, tuberculosis-specific interferon-gamma-based tests should move us one step closer to better control of this insidious pathogen."

The prevalence of tuberculosis infection among hospitalized patients in a pneumological department of an inner-city hospital was evaluated, using the intradermal tuberculin skin test (Mantoux technique). Interpretation of the Mantoux test was based on the size of induration in millimeters and the individual risk profile of the patients, according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control, revised in 1989. Of 697 tested patients, 252 showed test results consistent with tuberculosis infection (36.2%). 55 of these 697 patients had active tuberculosis disease or a prior history of tuberculosis (7.9%). A positive tuberculin skin test was found in 197 of 642 patients (30.7%) with a diagnosis different from tuberculosis (COPD, pneumonia, cancer and others).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance and the usefulness of an in vitro interferon gamma release assay in the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection in immunocompromised hospital-based population. PATIENTS AND METHOD A cohort of 445 high-risk adults from a hospital located in an intermediate tuberculosis burden area were prospectively evaluated for latent tuberculosis by means of the whole blood in vitro QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay (QTF), measuring tuberculosis-specific interferon gamma release by memory-effector T lymphocytes. RESULTS Overall the test displayed a positive result in 15.43% patients. Among the different risk groups, hemodialysis patients revealed the highest positive rates (30.23%). Indeterminate results (10.19% on the whole) were more often seen in neoplastic (18.03%) patients and in patients with autoimmune disease (17%). In 291 patients in whom QTF and Mantoux were simultaneously performed, concordance was moderate (kappa = 0.4520) with a 76.8% agreement when Mantoux was negative (179/233) but reaching only 50% (29/58) when Mantoux positive patients were selected. CONCLUSIONS QFT test is suitable for routine latent tuberculosis diagnosis in hospital-based immunocompromised patients. At least in some of them, i.e. hemodialysis and patients with autoimmune suppression, QFT adds valuable information for therapeutical decision-making. In Mantoux positive patients, it is very useful for ruling-out false positives due to BCG-vaccination and/or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection."

INTRODUCTION The Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) is a promising alternative to the tuberculin skin test (TST) for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). But so far only limited experience is available regarding the performance of these IGRAs especially in occupational medicine when used for screening healthcare workers (HCW). METHOD In an ongoing study employees of three German hospitals are screened for LTBI using the TST Mendel-Mantoux and the IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube) simultaneously. Information on earlier tests which had been performed with the multipuncture tests were obtained by interview. Risk factors for a positive test result were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS The analysis comprises 161 employees for whom information on all the tests - multipuncture test, TST Mendel-Mantoux and IGRA were available. The multipuncture test was positive in 34.8 %, the TST Mendel-Mantoux in 26.7 % and the IGRA in 12.4 % of the participants. When adjusting for the proportion of positive test results caused by cross-reaction with BCG vaccination, the prevalence of LTBI reduces to 18.8 % in the multipuncture test and 19.2 % in the TST Mendel-Mantoux. The Test results of the IGRA were positively correlated with age while the results of the two in-vivo tests were not. DISCUSSION The multipuncture test and the TST Mendel-Mantoux overestimate the prevalence of LTBI in HCW. A positive result in the TST should be verified by the IGRA before any further actions are recommended. A larger data base is needed in order to confirm that the IGRA is more sensitive in diagnosing a LTBI than the skin tests."

OBJECTIVE To compare the ability of the T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK), QuantiFERON-TB Gold (Cellestis, Melbourne, Australia), and Mantoux tests to identify latent tuberculosis in HIV-infected and uninfected persons. METHODS A cross-sectional study of 160 healthy adults without active tuberculosis attending a voluntary counseling and testing center for HIV infection in Khayelitsha, a deprived urban South African community with an HIV antenatal seroprevalence of 33% and a tuberculosis incidence of 1,612 per 100,000. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS One hundred and sixty (74 HIV(+) and 86 HIV(-)) persons were enrolled. A lower proportion of Mantoux results was positive in HIV-infected subjects compared with HIV-uninfected subjects (p < 0.01). By contrast, the proportion of positive IFNGRAs was not significantly different in HIV-infected persons for the T-SPOT.TB test (52 vs. 59%; p = 0.41) or the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (43 and 46%; p = 0.89). Fair agreement between the Mantoux test (5- and 10-mm cutoffs) and the IFNGRA was seen in HIV-infected people (kappa = 0.52-0.6). By contrast, poor agreement between the Mantoux and QuantiFERON-TB Gold tests was observed in the HIV-uninfected group (kappa = 0.07-0.30, depending on the Mantoux cutoff). The pattern was similar for T-SPOT.TB (kappa = 0.18-0.24). INTERPRETATION IFNGRA sensitivity appears relatively unimpaired by moderately advanced HIV infection. However, agreement between the tests and with the Mantoux test varied from poor to fair. This highlights the need for prospective studies to determine which test may predict the subsequent risk of tuberculosis."

BACKGROUND The Healthy Child Program and the Preventive Activities and Health Promotion Program involve systematic tuberculin skin testing at distinct ages according to different programs, with variable evaluation of its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the tuberculin skin test performed in healthy children within the ongoing basic health program in order to determine whether our activity is effective in detecting latent tuberculin infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective observational study was performed. POPULATION Mantoux test performed in children aged 15 months to 14 years during regular health examinations in 22 primary care pediatric clinics over a 12-month period in southern Pontevedra in Spain (catchment population 300,613 inhabitants according to the official census data in January 2003, with 472,444 health cards). Descriptive study and univariate analysis were carried out. RESULTS We studied 2,530 children with a mean age of 51.25 months (95 % CI: 49.38-53.13). Eight positive Mantoux tests were registered (0.36 %). There were three positive results in children aged less than 3 years, two positive results in children aged between 4 and 9 years old (all were immigrants) and the remaining positive results were registered in children between 10 and 14 years of age. CONCLUSIONS Given that the tuberculin skin test is a good screening test despite its limitations in the control of latent tuberculin infection in children, its indications should be adjusted to ever-changing epidemiological characteristics. According to the results obtained in this study and considering the prevalence of tuberculosis in our environment, we propose that the systematic application of the Mantoux test be discontinued except in children from countries with a high incidence of this disease or risk factors. However, we also recommend that systematic Mantoux testing in adolescence (12-14 years of age) be maintained, when vaccination and various medical examinations are carried out. Epidemiological studies in this age group should simultaneously be performed."

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency is characterized by the highly regulated transcription of a few viral genes essential for genome maintenance and host cell survival. A major latency control region has been identified upstream of the divergent promoters for the multicistronic transcripts encoding LANA (ORF73), vCyclin (ORF72), and vFLIP (ORF71) and for the complementary strand transcript encoding K14 and vGPCR (ORF74). Previous studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex. Deletion of the CTCF-cohesin binding site caused an inhibition of cell growth and viral genome instability. We now show that the KSHV genes regulated by CTCF-cohesin are under cell cycle control and that mutation of the CTCF binding sites abolished cell cycle-regulated transcription. Cohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Subcellular distribution of CTCF and colocalization with cohesins also varied across the cell cycle. Ectopic expression of Rad21 repressed CTCF-regulated transcription of KSHV lytic genes, and a Rad21-CTCF chimeric protein converted CTCF into an efficient transcriptional repressor of KSHV genes normally activated in the G(2) phase. We conclude that cohesins interact with CTCF in mid-S phase and repress CTCF-regulated genes in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival."

The 11-zinc finger protein CCTC-binding factor (CTCF) employs different sets of zinc fingers to form distinct complexes with varying CTCF- target sequences (CTSs) that mediate the repression or activation of gene expression and the creation of hormone-responsive gene silencers and of diverse vertebrate enhancer-blocking elements (chromatin insulators). To determine how these varying effects would integrate in vivo, we engineered a variety of expression systems to study effects of CTCF on cell growth. Here we show that ectopic expression of CTCF in many cell types inhibits cell clonogenicity by causing profound growth retardation without apoptosis. In asynchronous cultures, the cell-cycle profile of CTCF-expressing cells remained unaltered, which suggested that progression through the cycle was slowed at multiple points. Although conditionally induced CTCF caused the S-phase block, CTCF can also arrest cell division. Viable CTCF-expressing cells could be maintained without dividing for several days. While MYC is the well-characterized CTCF target, the inhibitory effects of CTCF on cell growth could not be ascribed solely to repression of MYC, suggesting that additional CTS-driven genes involved in growth-regulatory circuits, such as p19ARF, are likely to contribute to CTCF-induced growth arrest. These findings indicate that CTCF may regulate cell-cycle progression at multiple steps within the cycle, and add to the growing evidence for the function of CTCF as a tumor suppressor gene."

Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that causes malignant and inflammatory diseases in \u223c10% of infected people. A typical host has between 10(4) and 10(5) clones of HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes, each clone distinguished by the genomic integration site of the single-copy HTLV-1 provirus. The HTLV-1 bZIP (HBZ) factor gene is constitutively expressed from the minus strand of the provirus, whereas plus-strand expression, required for viral propagation to uninfected cells, is suppressed or intermittent in vivo, allowing escape from host immune surveillance. It remains unknown what regulates this pattern of proviral transcription and latency. Here, we show that CTCF, a key regulator of chromatin structure and function, binds to the provirus at a sharp border in epigenetic modifications in the pX region of the HTLV-1 provirus in T cells naturally infected with HTLV-1. CTCF is a zinc-finger protein that binds to an insulator region in genomic DNA and plays a fundamental role in controlling higher order chromatin structure and gene expression in vertebrate cells. We show that CTCF bound to HTLV-1 acts as an enhancer blocker, regulates HTLV-1 mRNA splicing, and forms long-distance interactions with flanking host chromatin. CTCF-binding sites (CTCF-BSs) have been propagated throughout the genome by transposons in certain primate lineages, but CTCF binding has not previously been described in present-day exogenous retroviruses. The presence of an ectopic CTCF-BS introduced by the retrovirus in tens of thousands of genomic locations has the potential to cause widespread abnormalities in host cell chromatin structure and gene expression."

Ectopic expression of CTCF in various normal and tumoral human cell lines inhibits cell division and clonogenicity, with the consequence to consider CTCF a potential tumor-suppressor factor. In this review article, we focused on the molecular mechanisms engaged by CTCF to modulate the expression of several key-regulators of differentiation, cellular senescence, cell cycle control and progression, whose expression is frequently altered in tumors. Moreover, we discussed common features of CTCF at each tumor-related DNA-binding sequence, such as protein-partners, post-translational modifications, and distinctive epigenetic marks establishment. The investigation of the molecular mechanisms engaged by CTCF to modulate tumor-related genes emphasizes the cell-type dependency of its tumor suppressor role. Indeed, the ability of CTCF to bind their promoters strictly depends by cell-type features as DNA methylation, BORIS-binding and post-translational modifications as PARYlation."

CCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a key regulator of gene expression through organization of the chromatin structure. Still, it is unclear how CTCF binding is perturbed in leukemia or in cancer in general. We studied CTCF binding by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in normal bone marrow (NBM) in the context of gene expression, DNA methylation, and azacitidine exposure. CTCF binding was increased in AML compared with NBM. Aberrant CTCF binding was enriched for motifs for key myeloid transcription factors such as CEBPA, PU.1, and RUNX1. AML with TET2 mutations was characterized by a particularly strong gain of CTCF binding, highly enriched for gain in promoter regions, while AML in general was enriched for changes at enhancers. There was a strong anticorrelation between CTCF binding and DNA methylation. Gain of CTCF occupancy was associated with increased gene expression; however, the genomic location (promoter vs distal regions) and enrichment of motifs (for repressing vs activating cofactors) were decisive for the gene expression pattern. Knockdown of CTCF in K562 cells caused loss of CTCF binding and transcriptional repression of genes with changed CTCF binding in AML, as well as loss of RUNX1 binding at RUNX1/CTCF-binding sites. In addition, CTCF knockdown caused increased differentiation. Azacitidine exposure caused major changes in CTCF occupancy in AML patient cells, partly by restoring a CTCF-binding pattern similar to NBM. We conclude that AML displays an aberrant increase in CTCF occupancy that targets key genes for AML development and impacts gene expression."

CTCF is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed DNA-binding protein that has widespread capabilities in gene regulation. CTCF plays important roles in cell growth regulatory processes and epigenetic functions. Ectopic expression of CTCF results in severe cell growth inhibition at multiple points within the cell cycle, indicating that CTCF levels must be stringently monitored. We have investigated the subcellular localization of CTCF in detail. Interestingly, we observe that CTCF shows a dynamic cell cycle-dependent distribution. Immunofluorescent staining reveals that in interphase CTCF is a nuclear protein, which is mainly excluded from the nucleolus. Strikingly, CTCF is associated with the centrosome during mitosis, especially from metaphase to anaphase. At telophase, CTCF dissociates from the centrosome and localizes to the midbody and the reformed nuclei. The association of CTCF with centrosomes and the midbody is further confirmed by biochemical fractionation. Moreover, subcellular fractions of CTCF show cell cycle and organelle-specific posttranslational modifications, suggesting different roles for CTCF at different stages of the cell cycle."

A human cell line, K562, that can be chemically induced to differentiate into various hematopoietic lineages was chosen as a model system for this study. Several K562 cell lines with constitutive and conditional expression of CTCF have been generated. By using these model systems we demonstrated that: (i) ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage; (ii) CTCF knock-down significantly inhibited differentiation of K562 cells into erythroid lineage; (iii) differentiation of K562 into the megakaryocytic lineage was not significantly affected; and (iv) down-regulation of MYC has been identified as one of the mechanisms by which CTCF promotes erythroid differentiation.

Binding sites of the chromatin regulator protein CTCF function as important landmarks in the human genome. The recently characterized CTCF-binding sites at LINE-1 repeats depend on another repeat-regulatory protein CGGBP1. These CGGBP1-dependent CTCF-binding sites serve as potential barrier elements for epigenetic marks such as H3K9me3. Such CTCF-binding sites are associated with asymmetric H3K9me3 levels as well as RNA levels in their flanks. The functions of these CGGBP1-dependent CTCF-binding sites remain unknown. By performing targeted studies on candidate CGGBP1-dependent CTCF-binding sites cloned in an SV40 promoter-enhancer episomal system we show that these regions act as inhibitors of ectopic transcription from the SV40 promoter. CGGBP1-dependent CTCF-binding sites that recapitulate their genomic function of loss of CTCF binding upon CGGBP1 depletion and H3K9me3 asymmetry in immediate flanks are also the ones that show the strongest inhibition of ectopic transcription. By performing a series of strand-specific reverse transcription PCRs we demonstrate that this ectopic transcription results in the synthesis of RNA from the SV40 promoter in a direction opposite to the downstream reporter gene in a strand-specific manner. The unleashing of the bidirectionality of the SV40 promoter activity and a breach of the transcription barrier seems to depend on depletion of CGGBP1 and loss of CTCF binding proximal to the SV40 promoter. RNA-sequencing reveals that CGGBP1-regulated CTCF-binding sites act as barriers to transcription at multiple locations genome-wide. These findings suggest a role of CGGBP1-dependent binding sites in restricting ectopic transcription."

Jpx RNA targets thousands of genomic sites, preferentially binding promoters of active genes. Depleting Jpx RNA causes ectopic CTCF binding, massive shifts in chromosome looping, and downregulation of >700 Jpx target genes. Without Jpx, thousands of lost loops are replaced by de novo loops anchored by ectopic CTCF sites. Although Jpx controls CTCF binding on a genome-wide basis, it acts selectively at the subset of developmentally sensitive CTCF sites. Specifically, Jpx targets low-affinity CTCF motifs and displaces CTCF protein through competitive inhibition. We conclude that Jpx acts as a CTCF release factor and shapes the 3D genome by regulating anchor site usage."

Gastric cancer (GC), a leading cause of cancer-related death, is a heterogeneous disease. We aim to describe clinically relevant molecular classifications of GC that incorporate heterogeneity and provide useful clinical information. We combined different gene expression datasets and filtered a 7-gene signature related to the extracellular matrix (ECM), which also exhibited significant prognostic value in GC patients. Interestingly, putative CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) regulatory elements were identified within the promoters of these ECM-related genes and were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). CTCF binding sites also overlapped with histone activation markers, indicating direct regulation. In addition, CTCF was also correlated with the Wnt signaling pathway. A comparison of human GC cell lines with high or low expression of ECM-related genes revealed different levels of tumor aggressiveness, suggesting the cancer development-promoting functions of ECM-related genes. Furthermore, CTCF regulated COL1A1 and COLA31 expression in vitro. Silencing CTCF or COL1A1/COL1A3 markedly inhibited cell growth and migration in the metastatic GC cell line BGC823. Collectively, this ECM-related 7-gene signature provides a novel insight for survival prediction among GC patients.

SETTING Department of Ophthalmology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. METHODS New Zealand White rabbits latently infected with HSV-1 W strain were divided into 3 groups. The first received 100 mg/kg/day of valacyclovir; the second, 200 mg/kg/day of valacyclovir; and the third (control), saline. One half the total dose of valacyclovir was delivered via intraperitoneal injections twice daily for 7 days beginning with 1 dose before LASIK. The HSV-1 ocular shedding was determined from eye cultures for 7 days after LASIK. RESULTS The administration of both 100 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day of valacyclovir significantly reduced the number of eyes (1/16 in both groups) and the total number of HSV-1 shedding days (1/122 and 2/122, respectively) from which HSV-1 was recovered compared to the control group (7/16 [P =.0396] and 14/129 [P <.007], respectively).

HEAT repeats correspond to tandemly arranged curlicue-like structures that appear to serve as flexible scaffolding on which other components can assemble. Using sensitive sequence analysis techniques we detected HEAT repeats in various chromosome-associated proteins, including four families of proteins associated with condensins and cohesins, which are nuclear complexes that contain structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins. Among the proteins detected were the XCAP-D2 and XCAP-G subunits of the Xenopus laevis 13S condensin complex, the Aspergillus BimD and Sordaria macrospora Spo76p proteins, the budding yeast Scc2p protein, and the related Drosophila transcriptional activator Nipped-B. Clathrin adaptor and COP-I coatomer subunits, which function in vesicle coat assembly and were previously noted to share weak sequence similarity to condensin subunits, also contain HEAT repeats. HEAT repeats were also found in the TBP-associated TIP120 protein, a global enhancer of transcription, and in the budding yeast Mot1p protein, which is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family. SWI2/SNF2 proteins, some of which are helicases, perform diverse roles in transcription control, DNA repair, and chromosome segregation and form chromatin-remodeling complexes. HEAT repeats also were found in dis1-TOG family and cofactor D family microtubule-associated proteins, which, owing to their roles in microtubule dynamics, perform functions related to mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. Hence, our analysis predicts structural features of these proteins and suggests that HEAT repeats may play important roles in chromosome dynamics."

As these repeats are often highly diverged, the prediction of HEAT or ARM domains can be challenging. Except for the most clear-cut cases, identification at the individual repeat level is indispensable, in particular for determining domain boundaries. However, methods using single sequence queries do not have the sensitivity required to deal with more divergent repeats and, when applied to proteins with known structures, in some cases failed to detect a single repeat. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Testing algorithms which use multiple sequence alignments as queries, we found two of them, HHpred and COACH, to detect HEAT and ARM repeats with greatly enhanced sensitivity. Calibration against experimentally determined structures suggests the use of three score classes with increasing confidence in the prediction, and prediction thresholds for each method. When we applied a new protocol using both HHpred and COACH to these structures, it detected 82% of HEAT repeats and 90% of ARM repeats, with the minimum for a given protein of 57% for HEAT repeats and 60% for ARM repeats. Application to bona fide HEAT and ARM proteins or domains indicated that similar numbers can be expected for the full complement of HEAT/ARM proteins. A systematic screen of the Protein Data Bank for false positive hits revealed their number to be low, in particular for ARM repeats. Double false positive hits for a given protein were rare for HEAT and not at all observed for ARM repeats. In combination with fold prediction and consistency checking (multiple sequence alignments, secondary structure prediction, and position analysis), repeat prediction with the new HHpred/COACH protocol dramatically improves prediction in the twilight zone of fold prediction methods, as well as the delineation of HEAT/ARM domain boundaries. SIGNIFICANCE A protocol is presented for the identification of individual HEAT or ARM repeats which is straightforward to implement. It provides high sensitivity at a low false positive rate and will therefore greatly enhance the accuracy of predictions of HEAT and ARM domains."

Repeat proteins have a modular organization and a regular architecture that make them attractive models for design and directed evolution experiments. HEAT repeat proteins, although very common, have not been used as a scaffold for artificial proteins, probably because they are made of long and irregular repeats. Here, we present and validate a consensus sequence for artificial HEAT repeat proteins. The sequence was defined from the structure-based sequence analysis of a thermostable HEAT-like repeat protein. Appropriate sequences were identified for the N- and C-caps. A library of genes coding for artificial proteins based on this sequence design, named \u03b1Rep, was assembled using new and versatile methodology based on circular amplification. Proteins picked randomly from this library are expressed as soluble proteins. The biophysical properties of proteins with different numbers of repeats and different combinations of side chains in hypervariable positions were characterized. Circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry experiments showed that all these proteins are folded cooperatively and are very stable (T(m) >70 \u00b0C). Stability of these proteins increases with the number of repeats. Detailed gel filtration and small-angle X-ray scattering studies showed that the purified proteins form either monomers or dimers. The X-ray structure of a stable dimeric variant structure was solved. The protein is folded with a highly regular topology and the repeat structure is organized, as expected, as pairs of alpha helices. In this protein variant, the dimerization interface results directly from the variable surface enriched in aromatic residues located in the randomized positions of the repeats. The dimer was crystallized both in an apo and in a PEG-bound form, revealing a very well defined binding crevice and some structure flexibility at the interface. This fortuitous binding site could later prove to be a useful binding site for other low molecular mass partners."

Here, we employed a quantitative proteomic approach using various modified peptide baits to identify reader proteins of various acyl modifications. We discovered that proteins harboring HEAT and ARM repeats bind to lysine myristoylated peptides. Recombinant HEAT and ARM repeats bind to myristoylated peptides independent of the peptide sequence or the position of the myristoyl group. Indeed, HEAT and ARM repeats bind directly to medium- and long-chain free fatty acids (MCFA and LCFA).

ARM and HEAT motifs are tandemly repeated sequences of approximately 50 amino acid residues that occur in a wide variety of eukaryotic proteins. An exhaustive search of sequence databases detected new family members and revealed that at least 1 in 500 eukaryotic protein sequences contain such repeats. It also rendered the similarity between ARM and HEAT repeats, believed to be evolutionarily related, readily apparent. All the proteins identified in the database searches could be clustered by sequence similarity into four groups: canonical ARM-repeat proteins and three groups of the more divergent HEAT-repeat proteins. This allowed us to build improved sequence profiles for the automatic detection of repeat motifs. Inspection of these profiles indicated that the individual repeat motifs of all four classes share a common set of seven highly conserved hydrophobic residues, which in proteins of known three-dimensional structure are buried within or between repeats. However, the motifs differ at several specific residue positions, suggesting important structural or functional differences among the classes. Our results illustrate that ARM and HEAT-repeat proteins, while having a common phylogenetic origin, have since diverged significantly. We discuss evolutionary scenarios that could account for the great diversity of repeats observed."

METHODS We enrolled patients with primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in a phase 2 randomized trial of oral ibudilast (\u2264100 mg daily) or placebo for 96 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the rate of brain atrophy, as measured by the brain parenchymal fraction (brain size relative to the volume of the outer surface contour of the brain). Major secondary end points included the change in the pyramidal tracts on diffusion tensor imaging, the magnetization transfer ratio in normal-appearing brain tissue, the thickness of the retinal nerve-fiber layer, and cortical atrophy, all measures of tissue damage in multiple sclerosis. RESULTS Of 255 patients who underwent randomization, 129 were assigned to ibudilast and 126 to placebo. A total of 53% of the patients in the ibudilast group and 52% of those in the placebo group had primary progressive disease; the others had secondary progressive disease.

INTRODUCTION Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammatory demyelination and progressive axonal loss. Clinically, this is manifest as relapsing and remitting neurological symptoms and progressive accumulation of disability. Ibudilast is a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which works by blocking the cleavage of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). It has been found to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in animal studies and in-vitro studies; it is currently being studied in progressive MS. AREAS COVERED This article reviews various studies looking at ibudilast as a potential therapy for MS. It summarizes prior and current clinical trials of ibudilast in MS as well as its pharmacology. EXPERT OPINION Although ibudilast has not been found to decrease the focal inflammatory activity in relapsing MS, it was shown to have an effect on preserving brain volume and disability progression. Ibudilast may have a role in the treatment of progressive MS phenotypes."

Ibudilast is an inhibitor of macrophage migration inhibitor factor and phosphodiesterases-4 and -10 and exhibits possible neuroprotective properties. The goals of SPRINT-MS study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ibudilast in PMS and to directly compare several imaging metrics for utility in PMS trials. METHODS SPRINT-MS is a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II trial of ibudilast in patients with PMS. Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either ibudilast (100mg/day) or placebo for 96weeks. Imaging is conducted every 24weeks for whole brain atrophy, magnetization transfer ratio, diffusion tensor imaging, cortical brain atrophy, and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Clinical outcomes include neurologic disability and patient reported quality of life. Safety assessments include laboratory testing, electrocardiography, and suicidality screening. RESULTS A total of 331 subjects were enrolled, of which 255 were randomized onto active study treatment. Randomized subjects were 53.7% female and mean age 55.7 (SD 7.3) years.

A phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDEI), Ibudilast, which has been in wide use for the management of bronchial asthma and cerebrovascular disease in Japan, was tested for its clinical efficacy on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Dark August rats. The severity of acute EAE was significantly ameliorated by prophylactic oral treatment with Ibudilast (10 mg/kg per day) starting on the day of immunization, although it did not modify the course of the disease when it was given after the onset of the first clinical sign of EAE. Histologically, inflammatory cell infiltration in the lumbar spinal cord was significantly reduced in Ibudilast-treated animals as compared to control animals. Ibudilast mildly suppressed MBP-induced proliferation of T cells in regional lymph nodes, the secretion of interferon-gamma from T cells activated by MBP in CFA, and the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha from macrophages. While the in vitro studies did not suggest difference between Ibudilast and other PDEIs such as rolipram, the clinical dose of Ibudilast is approximately 200-fold higher than that of rolipram and the effective dose of Ibudilast was relatively close to what has been therapeutically used in patients.

BACKGROUND Ibudilast has shown beneficial effects on several imaging outcomes in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS).

OBJECTIVE To assess the treatment effect of ibudilast on slowly enlarging lesion volumes over 96 weeks from a phase II clinical trial of ibudilast (Secondary and Primary Progressive Ibudilast NeuroNEXT Trial in Multiple Sclerosis [SPRINT-MS]). METHODS In total, 255 participants with progressive MS from 28 sites were randomized to oral ibudilast or placebo. Participants with at least four analyzable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included. Slowly enlarging lesions were quantified using Jacobian determinant maps. A linear model was used to assess the effect of ibudilast. Magnetization transfer ratio within slowly enlarging lesions was assessed to determine the effect of ibudilast on tissue integrity. RESULTS In total, 195 participants were included in this analysis. Ibudilast significantly decreased slowly enlarging lesion volume (23%, p = 0.003). Ibudilast also reduced magnetization transfer ratio change in slowly enlarging lesions: 0.22%/year, p = 0.04. CONCLUSION Ibudilast showed a significant effect on baseline volume of lesions that were slowly enlarging and magnetization transfer ratio in slowly enlarging lesions.

Sensitive real-time PCR for quantifying cytokine mRNA in the blood CD4+ cells revealed that the ibudilast monotherapy significantly reduced tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma mRNA and the IFN-gamma/interleukin-4 mRNA ratio, suggesting a shift in the cytokine profile from Th1 toward Th2 dominancy. In a flow cytometric analysis, natural killer T cells, which have been reported to relate to Th2 responses in MS and its animal model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), increased significantly after the therapy. None of the significant immunological changes were seen in healthy subjects or untreated MS patients. Ibudilast may be a promising therapy for MS and its clinical effects warrant further study."

BACKGROUND Ibudilast is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor influencing inflammation and neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS). This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and effects on MRI parameters of 2 different doses of ibudilast in relapsing forms of MS. METHODS In this multicenter, double-blind, phase 2 trial, patients with relapsing MS and gadolinium-enhancing lesions were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive 30 or 60 mg ibudilast or placebo every day for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the cumulative number of newly active lesions on bimonthly brain MRI over 12 months. Secondary endpoints included relapse rate, change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, T2-hyperintense and T1-hypointense lesion volumes, and percent brain volume change (PBVC). RESULTS A total of 297 patients were randomized in 19 centers. During the first 12 months, the mean number of active lesions and relapse rate did not differ between treatment arms. A reduction in PBVC (p = 0.04) was found in the 60-mg group (0.8%) compared with placebo (1.2%). Post hoc analysis showed a reduction in the proportion active lesions that evolved into persistent black holes for the 60-mg (0.14; p = 0.004) and 30-mg (0.17; p = 0.036) groups compared with the placebo group (0.24). Over 2 years, there were fewer patients (p = 0.026) with confirmed progression on the EDSS. Treatment with ibudilast was generally safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSION Ibudilast showed no beneficial effect on the rate of newly active lesions and relapses. However, preliminary evidence suggests that ibudilast seems to act in a neuroprotective fashion as measured by 2 independent MRI outcomes, with a possible beneficial clinical effect on disability progression. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This interventional study provides Class III evidence on the effect of ibudilast on disease activity."

PURPOSE The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, dosing and administration, and place in therapy of caplacizumab, a novel antibody fragment that inhibits von Willebrand factor, for the treatment of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are summarized. SUMMARY Caplacizumab is a humanized anti-von Willebrand factor monoclonal antibody fragment that inhibits the interaction between ultralarge von Willebrand factor multimers and platelets. Caplacizumab is indicated for use in combination with standard-of-care modalities such as plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy for the treatment of adults with acquired TTP. By inhibiting von Willebrand factor, caplacizumab offers a new approach to the management of TTP by preventing the development of potentially life-threatening microvascular thrombosis that can occur in the disease process. In a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, patients with acquired TTP treated with caplacizumab had more rapid platelet level normalization than placebo users; caplacizumab use also resulted in lower rates of disease recurrence and TTP-related death. The most common adverse events associated with caplacizumab use are bleeding-related events. In a phase 3 trial, serious bleeding-related adverse events were reported in 8 patients (11%) in the caplacizumab group and 1 patient (1%) in the placebo group. Caplacizumab is administered as an 11-mg intravenous loading dose 15 minutes prior to plasma exchange, followed by administration of 11 mg subcutaneously daily after plasma exchange. Once-daily caplacizumab administration can be continued for 30 days after the last plasma exchange. The medication and supplies for administration are provided as a single-use kit; patients should be trained on proper reconstitution and self-administration technique prior to the use of caplacizumab in the ambulatory setting. CONCLUSION Caplacizumab is a first-in-class von Willebrand factor inhibitor approved for the treatment of adults with acquired TTP."

Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a rare, life-threatening disease that causes systemic platelet-rich microthrombi with multiorgan damage. The historical treatment is based on therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and immunosuppression. Despite survival rates exceeding 85%, unfavorable outcomes including refractoriness, death, and exacerbations of the disease during treatment still calls for a better management strategy. Caplacizumab (Cablivi) appeared recently as a new treatment in iTTP. By inhibiting binding of von Willebrand factor to platelets, caplacizumab prevents platelets aggregation and the formation of microthrombi. Two pivotal randomized controlled trials have provided positive results where the use of caplacizumab is associated with faster platelet count recovery and less unfavorable outcomes. The other strength of this agent is an impressive alleviation in the burden of care, consisting in less TPE sessions and lower volumes of plasma to achieve remission, as well as substantial shortening in the length of hospitalization. However, since the recent approval of caplacizumab for the treatment of iTTP on the basis of these studies, debates remain regarding its systematic use in this indication. Should all patients be benefited from caplacizumab? Should we reserve caplacizumab only to the more severe patients? Should caplacizumab be initiated frontline or as a salvage therapy? If applicable, how should we select patients for caplacizumab? Last, is caplacizumab treatment cost-effective? This review aims at addressing these specific questions at a time when iTTP is entering the area of targeted therapies."

AIM This study aimed to model the financial impact of caplacizumab with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) + immunosuppression for patients experiencing an acute acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) episode versus TPE + immunosuppression, from a US hospital's perspective. METHODS AND MATERIALS We developed an economic model to estimate the impact of caplacizumab on a US hospital's budget. Cost offsets from caplacizumab utilization targeted inpatient general ward days, intensive care unit (ICU) days, and TPE utilization. Costs and event probabilities were estimated from primary data analyses of the phase 3 HERCULES trial and peer-reviewed literature or other public sources. Plan reimbursement was obtained from 2019 Medicare Fee Schedules and adjusted to represent reimbursement from different US payers. Cost of ICU and general ward utilization were estimated from Medicare Provider Analysis and Review data analyses capturing hospital discharges. RESULTS The model results indicate that caplacizumab leads to hospitalization cost savings of over $8,000 ($23,148 versus $14,904) along with TPE cost savings of over $14,000 ($37,150 versus $23,033) per patient. When the cost of caplacizumab and plan reimbursement are incorporated into the results, the per-patient cost of TPE + immunosuppression is $23,120 versus $70,068 for caplacizumab with TPE + immunosuppression, an incremental cost of $46,948. The model was robust to several scenario analyses; however, when limited to Medicare fee-for-service (FFS), the incremental cost of caplacizumab per patient was reduced to $4,852 due to add-on payments. CONCLUSIONS Caplacizumab with TPE + immunosuppression is associated with an increase in costs; however, the increase is nominal among payers who provide an add-on payment consistent with that of Medicare FFS."

OBJECTIVE To review the efficacy and safety of caplacizumab and ravulizumab for thrombotic microangiopathy. DATA SOURCES A literature search from January 2011 to May 2020 was performed using the key terms caplacizumab (or ALX-0681), ravulizumab (or ALXN1210), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), and thrombotic microangiopathy. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Relevant clinical trials and articles in the English language were identified and reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS aTTP and aHUS are syndromes of thrombotic microangiopathy manifested by excessive platelet aggregation and endothelial cell destruction, with subsequent thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and multiorgan failure. Current standard therapy for aTTP is therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) to remove von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers and anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. As an adjunctive therapy to TPE, caplacizumab inhibits binding of vWF to platelets and prevents new microthrombi formation. It reduces thromboembolic event rate and days of TPE and delays relapse. Headache and epistaxis were the most common adverse events. aHUS develops because of dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway, followed by constitutive activation of complement components that causes thrombosis and end-organ damage. Short-term initial evaluation with ravulizumab, a long-acting complement inhibitor, demonstrates rapid hematological and renal improvement, with sustained complement inhibition and tolerable adverse effects. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE This review describes the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, cost consideration, and clinical studies for caplacizumab and ravulizumab for thrombotic microangiopathy. Place of therapy is also discussed. CONCLUSION Targeted therapies with caplacizumab and ravulizumab are expected to reduce the burden of exacerbation, refractory disease, recurrence, and possibly death for thrombotic microangiopathy."

Caplacizumab prevents the interaction between von Willebrand factor and platelets, and is used to treat immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP). Its administration has been associated with a delay in ADAMTS13 activity restoration after plasma exchange (PEX) suspension. We analyzed the outcomes of 113 iTTP episodes, 75 of which were treated with caplacizumab, in 108 patients from the Spanish Registry of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura. Caplacizumab shortened the time to platelet count normalization and reduced PEX requirement, exacerbations and relapses. There was no difference in the time to achieve ADAMTS13 activity \u226520% after PEX end between caplacizumab-treated and non-treated episodes (14.5 [7.7-27.2] vs. 13.0 [8.0-29.0] days, median [IQR], P=.653). However, considering the 36 episodes where caplacizumab started <=3 days after iTTP diagnosis, the time to ADAMTS13 restoration from PEX end was higher than in those episodes where caplacizumab started >3 days after iTTP diagnosis (20.0 [12.0-43.0] vs. 11.0 [3.5-20.0] days, P = .003), or than in non-caplacizumab-treated episodes (P=.033). This finding could be related to a significantly shorter duration of PEX in early caplacizumab-treated episodes than in late caplacizumab-treated episodes (5.5 [4.0-9.0] vs. 15.0 [11.0-21.5] days, P <.001) or non-caplacizumab-treated episodes (11.0 [6.0-26.0] days, P < .001). There were no differences in time to ADAMTS-13 restoration from PEX start (28.0 [17.2-47.5], 27.0 [19.0-37.5] and 29.5 [15.2-45.0] days in early caplacizumab-treated, late caplacizumab-treated and non-caplacizumab-treated episodes). Early administered caplacizumab does not prevent the requirement for immunosuppression but has beneficial effects by shortening PEX requirement without major safety concerns."

The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the safety and efficacy of caplacizumab vs the standard of care and assess the effect of the concomitant use of rituximab. A retrospective study from the Spanish TTP Registry of patients treated with caplacizumab vs those who did not receive it was conducted.

BACKGROUND Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is caused by aggregation of platelets on ultralarge von Willebrand factor multimers. This microvascular thrombosis causes multiorgan ischemia with potentially life-threatening complications. Daily plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapies induce remission, but mortality and morbidity due to microthrombosis remain high. METHODS Caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor humanized single-variable-domain immunoglobulin (Nanobody), inhibits the interaction between ultralarge von Willebrand factor multimers and platelets. In this phase 2, controlled study, we randomly assigned patients with acquired TTP to subcutaneous caplacizumab (10 mg daily) or placebo during plasma exchange and for 30 days afterward. The primary end point was the time to a response, defined as confirmed normalization of the platelet count. Major secondary end points included exacerbations and relapses. RESULTS Seventy-five patients underwent randomization (36 were assigned to receive caplacizumab, and 39 to receive placebo). The time to a response was significantly reduced with caplacizumab as compared with placebo (39% reduction in median time, P=0.005). Three patients in the caplacizumab group had an exacerbation, as compared with 11 patients in the placebo group. Eight patients in the caplacizumab group had a relapse in the first month after stopping the study drug, of whom 7 had ADAMTS13 activity that remained below 10%, suggesting unresolved autoimmune activity. Bleeding-related adverse events, most of which were mild to moderate in severity, were more common with caplacizumab than with placebo (54% of patients vs. 38%). The frequencies of other adverse events were similar in the two groups. Two patients in the placebo group died, as compared with none in the caplacizumab group. CONCLUSIONS Caplacizumab induced a faster resolution of the acute TTP episode than did placebo. The platelet-protective effect of caplacizumab was maintained during the treatment period. Caplacizumab was associated with an increased tendency toward bleeding, as compared with placebo. (Funded by Ablynx; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01151423.)."

METHODS We conducted an international phase 3 trial involving patients with aggressive lymphoma that was refractory to or progressing within 12 months after first-line therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive tisagenlecleucel with optional bridging therapy (tisagenlecleucel group) or salvage chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) (standard-care group). The primary end point was event-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to stable or progressive disease at or after the week 12 assessment or death. Crossover to receive tisagenlecleucel was allowed if a defined event occurred at or after the week 12 assessment. Other end points included response and safety. RESULTS A total of 322 patients underwent randomization. At baseline, the percentage of patients with high-grade lymphomas was higher in the tisagenlecleucel group than in the standard-care group (24.1% vs. 16.9%), as was the percentage with an International Prognostic Index score (range, 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis) of 2 or higher (65.4% vs. 57.5%).

The most common other adverse events were ALT elevation, AST elevation, diarrhea, edema, and creatinine elevation. No treatment-related mortality was observed. A Sub-analysis showed that a high metabolic tumor volume (MTV; \u2265 80 ml) and stable disease /progressive disease before tisagenlecleucel infusion were both significantly associated with a poor EFS and OS in a multivariate analysis (P < 0.05). Notably, the combination of these 2 factors efficiently stratified the prognosis of these patients (HR 6.87 [95% CI 2.4-19.65; P < 0.05] into a high-risk group). CONCLUSION We report the first real-world data on tisagenlecleucel for r/r B-cell lymphoma in Japan. Tisagenlecleucel is feasible and effective, even in late line treatment. In addition, our results support a new algorithm for predicting the outcomes of tisagenlecleucel."

OBJECTIVE Tisagenlecleucel is a CD19-directed, genetically modified, autologous T-cell immunotherapy indicated for pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and for adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment with any chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a multistep process in which nurses and nurse practitioners are key to managing patient safety. Managing patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy in the outpatient setting (as Penn does with tisagenlecleucel and lisocabtagene maraleucel) requires an even more complex process. The objective of this manuscript is to provide guidance on the role of nurses in the outpatient administration of tisagenlecleucel therapy and postinfusion care in adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Oncology and apheresis nurses discuss institutional processes and perspectives related to the patient experience with tisagenlecleucel therapy at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. DATA SOURCES Author experience. CONCLUSION Nurses are vital for the success of the patient management processes involved with tisagenlecleucel therapy. Nurses must be thoroughly educated in tisagenlecleucel therapy and adverse event management and be able to effectively communicate all aspects of therapy among the multidisciplinary team of the hospital, the product manufacturer, and patients and families. Establishment of the nurse cellular therapy coordinator at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania was advantageous in facilitating effective communication in all these situations. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING This encompassing approach to patient management is particularly necessary during administration of tisagenlecleucel therapy and other CAR-T cell therapies that are managed in the outpatient setting."

PURPOSE To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-effective price of tisagenlecleucel, a novel, effective chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, versus salvage chemotherapy (SC) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL) using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a US third-party payer's perspective. METHODS A three-state (progression-free survival, progressive disease, and death), responder-based partitioned survival model with a lifetime horizon and 3% annual discount rate was developed. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival of tisagenlecleucel were estimated separately for patients with and without an overall response (OR), using data from JULIET ( Study of Efficacy and Safety of CTL019 in Adult DLBCL Patients). OS of SC was informed by SCHOLAR-1 (Retrospective Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Research). Mixture cure models were used to inform the survival of tisagenlecleucel responders, supported by JULIET. The median OS was 11.1 months in all tisagenlecleucel-treated patients but not reached for responders; no progression or death occurred among responders since month 22 of treatment. For tisagenlecleucel nonresponders and SC, survival was based on standard parametric models until month 60and the survival of DLBCL long-term survivors thereafter. The model prediction validated well against the observed trial data. Costs and utilities were from the literature; utilities depended on health states and were used to estimate QALYs. Total costs, QALYs, and incremental cost per QALY gained were estimated. A cost-effective price range was estimated for all tisagenlecleucel-treated patients, OR responders, and complete response (CR) responders. Deterministic sensitivity and scenario analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. All costs were reported in or inflated to 2020 US dollars. FINDINGS Tisagenlecleucel was associated with 3.35 QALYs gained versus SC.,The estimated incremental costs per QALY gained versus SC were $78,652 using the wholesale acquisition cost of $373,000 for tisagenlecleucel. The estimated cost-effective price of tisagenlecleucel in all treated patients was $612,270 at the WTP threshold of $150,000. Tisagenlecleucel OR and CR responders had an increase of 7.82 and 9.34 QALYs versus SC, with cost-effective prices estimated at $1,281,456 and $1,551,974, respectively. Sensitivity analysis results supported the base case findings. IMPLICATIONS Tisagenlecleucel is a cost-effective treatment versus SC for r/r DLBCL from the perspective of a US third-party payer. The estimated cost-effective prices ranged from $612,270 (all tisagenlecleucel-treated patients) to up to $1.5 million (patients achieving CR). Limitations include the use of single-arm trials due to data availability."

Macrophage is an important innate immune cell that not only initiates inflammatory responses, but also functions in tissue repair and anti-inflammatory responses. Regulating macrophage activity is thus critical to maintain immune homeostasis. Tyro3, Axl, and Mer are integral membrane proteins that constitute TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Growing evidence indicates that TAM family receptors play an important role in anti-inflammatory responses through modulating the function of macrophages. First, macrophages can recognize apoptotic bodies through interaction between TAM family receptors expressed on macrophages and their ligands attached to apoptotic bodies. Without TAM signaling, macrophages cannot clear up apoptotic cells, leading to broad inflammation due to over-activation of immune cells. Second, TAM signaling can prevent chronic activation of macrophages by attenuating inflammatory pathways through particular pattern recognition receptors and cytokine receptors. Third, TAM signaling can induce autophagy which is an important mechanism to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Fourth, TAM signaling can inhibit polarization of M1 macrophages. In this review, we will focus on mechanisms involved in how TAM family of RTKs can modulate function of macrophage associated with anti-inflammatory responses described above. We will also discuss several human diseases related to TAM signaling and potential therapeutic strategies of targeting TAM signaling."

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane receptors that bind growth factors and cytokines and contain a regulated kinase activity within their cytoplasmic domain. RTKs play an important role in signal transduction in both normal and malignant cells, and their encoding genes belong to the most frequently affected genes in cancer cells. The TAM family proteins (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) are involved in diverse biological processes: immune regulation, clearance of apoptotic cells, platelet aggregation, cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Recent studies show that TAMs share overlapping functions in tumorigenesis and suppression of antitumour immunity. MERTK and AXL operate in innate immune cells to suppress inflammatory responses and promote an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment, while AXL expression correlates with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and motility in tumours. Therefore, TAM RTKs represent a dual target in cancer due to their intrinsic roles in tumour cell survival, migration, chemoresistance, and their immunosuppressive roles in the tumour microenvironment (TME). In this review, we discuss the potential of TAMs as emerging therapeutic targets in cancer treatment. We critically assess and compare current approaches to target TAM RTKs in solid tumours and the development of new inhibitors for both extra- and intracellular domains of TAM receptor kinases."

Novel treatment approaches are needed to overcome innate and acquired mechanisms of resistance to current anticancer therapies in cancer cells and the tumour immune microenvironment. The TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are potential therapeutic targets in a wide range of cancers. In cancer cells, TAM RTKs activate signalling pathways that promote cell survival, metastasis and resistance to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapies. TAM RTKs also function in innate immune cells, contributing to various mechanisms that suppress antitumour immunity and promote resistance to immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, TAM antagonists provide an unprecedented opportunity for both direct and immune-mediated therapeutic activity provided by inhibition of a single target, and are likely to be particularly effective when used in combination with other cancer therapies. To exploit this potential, a variety of agents have been designed to selectively target TAM RTKs, many of which have now entered clinical testing. This Review provides an essential guide to the TAM RTKs for clinicians, including an overview of the rationale for therapeutic targeting of TAM RTKs in cancer cells and the tumour immune microenvironment, a description of the current preclinical and clinical experience with TAM inhibitors, and a perspective on strategies for continued development of TAM-targeted agents for oncology applications."

Severe hepatic inflammation is a common cause of acute or chronic liver disease. Macrophages are one of the key mediators which regulate the progress of hepatic inflammation. Increasing evidence shows that the TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) family of RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases), which is expressed in macrophages, alleviates inflammatory responses through a negative feedback loop. However, the functional contribution of each TAM family member to the progression of hepatic inflammation remains elusive. In this study, we explore the role of individual TAM family proteins during autophagy induction and evaluate their contribution to hepatic inflammation. Among the TAM family of RTKs, AXL (AXL receptor tyrosine kinase) only induces autophagy in macrophages after interaction with its ligand, GAS6 (growth arrest specific 6). Based on our results, autophosphorylation of 2 tyrosine residues (Tyr815 and Tyr860) in the cytoplasmic domain of AXL in mice is required for autophagy induction and AXL-mediated autophagy induction is dependent on MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)14 activity. Furthermore, induction of AXL-mediated autophagy prevents CASP1 (caspase 1)-dependent IL1B (interleukin 1, \u03b2) and IL18 (interleukin 18) maturation by inhibiting NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome activation. In agreement with these observations, axl-/- mice show more severe symptoms than do wild-type (Axl+/+) mice following acute hepatic injury induced by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Hence, GAS6-AXL signaling-mediated autophagy induction in murine macrophages ameliorates hepatic inflammatory responses by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation."

SAD PERSONS and Modified SAD PERSONS (MSPS) scale scores were recorded for individuals at their index and all subsequent presentations. The 2 main outcome measures in the study included current suicide attempts (at index presentation) and future suicide attempts (within the next 6 months). The ability of the scales to predict suicide attempts was evaluated with logistic regression, sensitivity and specificity analyses, and receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS 566 people presented with suicide attempts (14.1% of the sample). Both SAD PERSONS and MSPS showed poor predictive ability for future suicide attempts. Compared to low risk scores, high risk baseline scores had low sensitivity (19.6% and 40.0%, respectively) and low positive predictive value (5.3% and 7.4%, respectively). SAD PERSONS did not predict suicide attempts better than chance (area under the curve =0.572; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.64; P value nonsignificant). Stepwise regression identified 5 original scale items that accounted for the greatest proportion of future suicide attempt variance. High risk scores using this model had high sensitivity (93.5%) and were associated with a 5-fold higher likelihood of future suicide attempt presentation (odds ratio =5.58; 95% CI, 2.24-13.86; P<.001).

The remaining scales performed significantly worse than clinician and patient estimates of risk (P<0.001).ConclusionsRisk scales following self-harm have limited clinical utility and may waste valuable resources. Most scales performed no better than clinician or patient ratings of risk. Some performed considerably worse. Positive predictive values were modest. In line with national guidelines, risk scales should not be used to determine patient management or predict self-harm."

BACKGROUND Past and repeated self-harm are long-term risks to completed suicide. A brief rating scale to assess repetition risk of self-harm is important for high-risk identification and early interventions in suicide prevention. The study aimed to examine the validity of the Chinese SAD PERSONS Scale (CSPS) and to evaluate its feasibility in clinical settings. METHODS One hundred and forty-seven patients with self-harm were recruited from the Emergency Department and assessed at baseline and the sixth month. The controls, 284 people without self-harm from the Family Medicine Department in the same hospital were recruited and assessed concurrently. The psychometric properties of the CSPS were examined using baseline and follow-up measurements that assessed a variety of suicide risk factors. Clinical feasibility and applicability of the CSPS were further evaluated by a group of general nurses who used case vignette approach in CSPS risk assessment in clinical settings. An open-ended question inquiring their opinions of scale adaptation to hospital inpatient assessment for suicide risks were also analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS The CSPS was significantly correlated with other scales measuring depression, hopelessness and suicide ideation. A cut-off point of the scale was at 4/5 in predicting 6-month self-harm repetition with the sensitivity and specificity being 65.4% and 58.1%, respectively. Based on the areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, the predictive validity of the scale showed a better performance than the other scales. Fifty-four nurses, evaluating the scale using case vignette found it a useful tool to raise the awareness of suicide risk and a considerable tool to be adopted into nursing care. CONCLUSIONS The Chinese SAD PERSONS Scale is a brief instrument with acceptable psychometric properties for self-harm prediction. However, cautions should be paid to level of therapeutic relationships during assessment, staff workload and adequate training for wider clinical applications."

Objective. To investigate the effects of bright light treatment for secondary outcome measures and to explore and validate empirically derived subgroups and treatment effects in subgroups. Methods. A descriptive design. A sample of forty-nine persons (mean age of 45.8) with clinically assessed seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or subsyndromal SAD (S-SAD) participated in a two-group clinical trial evaluating the effects of treatment with bright light therapy. A person-oriented cluster analysis was applied to study treatment effects in subgroups. Results. For the merged group, sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), fatigue (fatigue questionnaire), and health-related quality of life (SF-36) were improved at posttreatment, and results were maintained at the one-month followup. Three distinct subgroups had a high level of fatigue in common, while the level of excessive daytime sleepiness and depressed mood differed between the subgroups. Over time, all subgroups improved following ten days treatment in a light room. Conclusion. Fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, and health-related quality of life improve in a similar way as depressed mood following treatment with bright light. The treatment was effective irrespective of the severity of the disorder, that is, for persons with SAD and subsyndromal SAD."

The arterial baroreflex regulates arterial pressure within a narrow range of variation. After sino-aortic denervation (SAD), rats show a large increase in arterial pressure variability, but mean arterial pressure levels remain similar to those of control rats. Considering that breathing influences the control of arterial pressure, the question is: to what extent does SAD cause changes in breathing? What is the main finding and its importance? Removal of arterial baroreceptors produced changes in breathing in rats, marked by a reduction in respiratory frequency, but not hypertension. These findings are indicative of a possible interaction of respiratory and autonomic neural mechanisms in the regulation of arterial pressure after SAD. Sino-aortic denervated (SAD) rats exhibit a mean arterial pressure (MAP) similar to that of control rats. Given that respiration modulates MAP, we hypothesized that conscious SAD rats show respiratory changes associated with the normal MAP. In this study, we evaluated the cardiovascular and respiratory activities and arterial blood gases in control and SAD rats. Male juvenile Wistar rats (postnatal day 19-21) were submitted to SAD, sham surgery or selective removal of the carotid bodies (CBX), and the three groups were evaluated 10 days after the surgery (SAD, n = 21; Sham, n = 18; and CBX, n = 13). The MAP in Sham, SAD and CBX groups was similar (P > 0.05), but the variability of MAP was significantly higher in SAD than in Sham and CBX rats (P < 0.0001). The duration of expiration and inspiration increased in SAD rats compared with Sham and CBX rats, which resulted in a reduced respiratory frequency and minute ventilation (P < 0.05). The arterial partial pressure of O2 and the haemoglobin saturation were reduced in SAD and CBX compared with Sham rats, whereas the arterial partial pressure of CO2 was increased in SAD compared with Sham rats. The short- and long-term respiratory variability were significantly higher in SAD than in Sham and CBX rats (P < 0.05). In addition, the reductions in MAP during deep breaths were greater in SAD than in Sham and CBX rats (P < 0.0001). The data show that SAD rats exhibit respiratory changes, which may be one of the compensatory mechanisms associated with the maintenance of normal levels of MAP in the absence of arterial baroreceptors."

BACKGROUND Prior studies on the association between sleep disturbances and suicidal behavior did not explore whether or not short sleep is a marker of suicide intent, lethality or risk. METHODS DESIGN Cross-sectional. PARTICIPANTS Suicide attempters (SAs) (n=434). Controls included 83 psychiatric inpatients who have never been SAs, and 509 healthy controls. MEASUREMENTS Short sleep was defined by self-assessment as \u2264 5 h per day. The MINI and the DSM-IV version of the International Personality Disorder Examination Screening Questionnaire were used to diagnose Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, respectively. Suicide intent and lethality were evaluated through the Beck's Suicidal Intent Scale (SIS) and the Risk-Rescue Rating Scale (RRRS), respectively. Beck's Medical Lethality Scale (BMLS) was administered to assess the degree of medical injury, and the SAD PERSONS mnemonic scale was used to evaluate suicide risk. STATISTICAL ANALYSES Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses explored frequencies of short sleep in 3 samples. Chi-square tests explored whether or not suicide intent, lethality and risk were greater in SAs with short-sleep versus those without short-sleep. RESULTS Short sleep was more prevalent in SAs than in psychiatric controls only in males. In female SAs, short sleep was significantly associated with several SIS items and high scores in the SAD PERSONS. LIMITATIONS Sleep duration was assessed only by self-report. CONCLUSIONS The association between short sleep and suicidal behavior may be partly explained by confounders. Short sleep may be a marker of severity of suicidal behavior among female SAs."

OBJECTIVE We evaluated whether the association between Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) was mediated by the circadian rhythm. METHOD Data of 2239 persons from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) were used. Two groups were compared: with clinically significant ADHD symptoms (N = 175) and with No ADHD symptoms (N = 2064). Sleep parameters were sleep-onset and offset times, mid sleep and sleep duration from the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. We identified the prevalence of probable SAD and subsyndromal SAD using the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ). Clinically significant ADHD symptoms were identified by using a T score>65 on the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale. RESULTS The prevalence of probable SAD was estimated at 9.9% in the ADHD group (vs. 3.3% in the No ADHD group) and of probable s-SAD at 12.5% in the ADHD group (vs 4.6% in the No ADHD group). Regression analyses showed consistently significant associations between ADHD symptoms and probable SAD, even after adjustment for current depression and anxiety, age, sex, education, use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines (B = 1.81, p < 0.001). Late self-reported sleep onset was an important mediator in the significant relationship between ADHD symptoms and probable SAD, even after correction for confounders (total model effects: B = 0.14, p \u2264 0.001). CONCLUSION Both seasonal and circadian rhythm disturbances are significantly associated with ADHD symptoms. Delayed sleep onset time in ADHD may explain the increase in SAD symptoms. Treating patients with SAD for possible ADHD and delayed sleep onset time may reduce symptom severity in these complex patients."

WHAT IS KNOWN AND BACKGROUND Social anxiety disorder (SAD) often follows a chronic course and is associated with substantial impairment in functioning. Although results from clinical trials clearly establish evidence for efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy in treating this disorder, up to 50% of patients with SAD show little or no improvement. Thus, new approaches that have promised in improving the efficacy of treatment for SAD are needed. One such approach is the trial-based thought record (TBTR), which targets the restructuring of patients' core beliefs. OBJECTIVE To determine whether patients receiving TBTR would report fewer symptoms of social anxiety and general psychiatric distress following treatment, relative to conventional cognitive therapy (CCT). METHODS A two-arm randomized trial comparing TBTR (n = 17) with a set of CCT techniques (n = 19), which included the standard seven-column dysfunctional thought record and the positive data log in SAD patients according to DSM-IV. RESULTS Scores on many outcome measures decreased significantly across the course of treatment in both groups (P < 0\u00b7001), including the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNE), Social Avoidance and Distress Scale (SADS), Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement. In addition, a one-way ancova, taking baseline values as covariates, showed that TBTR was significantly more efficacious than CCT in reducing the scores of FNE (P = 0\u00b701 at mid-treatment and P = 0\u00b7004 at post-treatment), and SADS (P = 0\u00b703 at post-treatment). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION This study provides preliminary evidence that TBTR is at least as efficacious as CCT in reducing symptoms of SAD, pointing to the need for additional studies of TBTR in SAD and other psychiatric disorders."

BACKGROUND Modern biology has shifted from \"one gene\" approaches to methods for genomic-scale analysis like microarray technology, which allow simultaneous measurement of thousands of genes. This has created a need for tools facilitating interpretation of biological data in \"batch\" mode. However, such tools often leave the investigator with large volumes of apparently unorganized information. To meet this interpretation challenge, gene-set, or cluster testing has become a popular analytical tool. Many gene-set testing methods and software packages are now available, most of which use a variety of statistical tests to assess the genes in a set for biological information. However, the field is still evolving, and there is a great need for \"integrated\" solutions. RESULTS GeneTools is a web-service providing access to a database that brings together information from a broad range of resources. The annotation data are updated weekly, guaranteeing that users get data most recently available. Data submitted by the user are stored in the database, where it can easily be updated, shared between users and exported in various formats. GeneTools provides three different tools: i) NMC Annotation Tool, which offers annotations from several databases like UniGene, Entrez Gene, SwissProt and GeneOntology, in both single- and batch search mode. ii) GO Annotator Tool, where users can add new gene ontology (GO) annotations to genes of interest. These user defined GO annotations can be used in further analysis or exported for public distribution. iii) eGOn, a tool for visualization and statistical hypothesis testing of GO category representation. As the first GO tool, eGOn supports hypothesis testing for three different situations (master-target situation, mutually exclusive target-target situation and intersecting target-target situation). An important additional function is an evidence-code filter that allows users, to select the GO annotations for the analysis. CONCLUSION GeneTools is the first \"all in one\" annotation tool, providing users with a rapid extraction of highly relevant gene annotation data for e.g. thousands of genes or clones at once. It allows a user to define and archive new GO annotations and it supports hypothesis testing related to GO category representations. GeneTools is freely available through www.genetools.no"

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has proven to be a highly effective and safe way to prevent HIV infection. Seroconversion and primary HIV infection are exceptional if adherence to PrEP is good. However, primary HIV infection while using PrEP can occur, albeit rarely, and HIV drug resistance might develop. Furthermore, the scope of PrEP is expected to expand, and clinicians might face potential seroconversions and primary HIV infection in patients starting or taking PrEP. The characteristics of primary HIV infection in users of PrEP are poorly described. PrEP users present a lower viral load peak during primary HIV infection and, frequently, fewer symptoms than individuals not exposed to PrEP. Additionally, PrEP prolongs the stages of seroconversion, thus potentially complicating diagnosis of primary HIV infection. Drug resistance is rare, occurring mostly when PrEP is initiated in undiagnosed patients who are at an extremely early stage of infection, in whom detection of HIV-RNA was not used to rule out HIV infection. Therefore, careful exclusion of primary HIV infection before starting PrEP is crucial. In patients presenting with primary HIV infection while on PrEP, a drug with a high genetic barrier (or even two) should be added to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine until test results for resistance are available."

OBJECTIVES The use of antibiotics as pre-exposure or postexposure prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention (STI prophylaxis) is not currently recommended in the UK, but there is evidence that self-prescribing occurs among those at greatest risk. We present the prevalence and factors associated with STI prophylaxis among a community sample of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users. METHODS The 2019 online PrEP User Survey ran between 17 May and 1 July. Eligible participants included UK residents reporting HIV PrEP use or having tried to obtain HIV PrEP since January 2017. STI prophylaxis use was defined as reporting buying antibiotics to prevent STIs, either privately or through the internet; this question was only asked to HIV PrEP users. Factors associated with STI prophylaxis use were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Overall, 9% (167/1856) of HIV PrEP users reported STI prophylaxis use; 97% were gay or bisexual men, 84% reported white ethnicity, 55% resided in London and 69% were aged \u226535 years. Factors associated with STI prophylaxis included: reporting \u22655 compared with 1-4 condomless sex partners in the past 6 months (12% vs 5.6%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.80; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.64), reporting chemsex drug use compared with no sexualised drug use in the past 12 months (13% vs 6.0%, aOR=1.88; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.93) and reporting an STI diagnosis in the past 12 months (12% vs 6.6%, aOR=1.54; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.18). Variables not significant in multivariable analyses included: ethnicity, age, residence and HIV PrEP sourcing. CONCLUSIONS Approximately 1 in 10 HIV PrEP users from this community sample reported self-prescribed STI prophylaxis. STI prophylaxis was associated with sexual behaviour known to facilitate STI transmission and with a history of recent STIs acquisition. Given the potential risk of antimicrobial resistance, sexual health clinicians should consider asking attendees, especially HIV PrEP users, about the use of antibiotics as STI prophylaxis, to inform appropriate counselling, testing and management."

INTRODUCTION Trans masculine people who have sex with cisgender (\"cis\") men (\"trans MSM\") may be at-risk for HIV infection when they have cis MSM partners or share needles for hormone or recreational drug injection. Limited data are available characterizing indications and uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in trans MSM. The aim of this study was to assess PrEP indication and uptake as a means of primary HIV prevention for adult trans MSM in the U.S. METHODS Between November and December 2017, a national convenience sample of trans MSM in the U.S. (n = 857) was recruited using participatory methodologies and completed an online survey of demographics, HIV risk, PrEP, behavioural and psychosocial factors. Self-reported receptive anal sex or frontal/vaginal sex (with or without a condom) with a cis male sex partner in past six months was an eligibility criterion. A multivariable logistic regression procedure was used to model PrEP indications (yes/no) per an interpretation of U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommendations among those without HIV (n = 843). RESULTS The diverse sample was 4.9% Black; 22.1% Latinx ethnicity; 28.4% non-binary gender identity; 32.6% gay-identified; 82.7% on testosterone. Overall, 84.1% had heard of PrEP. Of these, 33.3% reported lifetime PrEP use (21.8% current and 11.5% past). Based on HIV behavioural risk profiles in the last six months, 55.2% of respondents had indications for PrEP. In a multivariable model, factors associated with PrEP indication included where met sex partners, not having sex exclusively with cismen, higher perceived HIV risk, greater number of partners and high cis male partner stigma (all p < 0.05). DISCUSSION The majority of trans MSM in this sample had a PrEP indication. Stigma was associated with risk for HIV acquisition and represents a critical target for HIV biobehavioural prevention interventions for trans MSM, who appear to be underutilizing PrEP. CONCLUSIONS Results from this study support the full inclusion of trans MSM in HIV biobehavioural prevention efforts. Public health interventions and programmes are needed to reach trans MSM that attend to general MSM risk factors as well as to vulnerabilities specific to trans MSM, including the context of stigma from cis male sexual partners."

Available research supports that PrEP, when used as prescribed, can prevent HIV transmission by upwards of 96%. Such findings have led to the development of research publications and guidelines supporting PrEP for individuals at high risk for HIV acquisition, such as men who have sex with men (MSM). Despite its benefit, current use of PrEP in clinical settings has been undermined by false impressions of poor efficacy of PrEP and concerns about increased risk-taking among MSM should PrEP be readily available. Furthermore, guidance for the role of public health units in PrEP access has not been well defined. While we maintain that PrEP should be available to any person who requests it, we feel that public health units should focus on those at highest risk for HIV acquisition, and, in doing so, possibly reduce local HIV rates."

Following a year of valganciclovir prophylaxis, a lung transplant recipient developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection that became resistant to ganciclovir, as confirmed by detection of UL97 kinase mutation M460V and a previously uncharacterized UL54 DNA polymerase mutation L516P. The latter mutation is now shown to confer ganciclovir and cidofovir resistance. As predicted from the viral genotype, foscarnet therapy was effective, but resumption of valganciclovir as secondary prophylaxis resulted in a plasma viral load rebound to 3.6 log10 copies/mL several weeks later. Valganciclovir was then replaced by letermovir, resulting in gradual viral load reduction in the first 5 weeks to below the quantitation limit (2.7 log10 copies/mL) for 1 week, followed by 10 weeks of rising viral loads reaching 4.3 log10 copies/mL while on letermovir. At this point, CMV genotypic testing revealed UL56 mutation C325Y, which confers absolute resistance to letermovir. Retreatment with foscarnet was successful. This case adds to the considerable list of proven ganciclovir resistance mutations, and provides an early experience with letermovir resistance after off-label therapeutic use. This experience is consistent with in vitro observations of rapid emergence of letermovir-resistant CMV after drug exposure."

Letermovir resistance emerged after a few months of secondary prophylaxis in the two renal transplant recipients. In both cases, the previously described UL56 C325Y letermovir resistance mutation was detected. In vitro studies of letermovir suggest a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance.

Apalutamide is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated agent used for the treatment of men with non-metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (nmCRPC) and metastatic Hormone-Naive Prostate Cancer (mHNPC). Androgen receptor signaling is a leading factor that drives these prostate tumors. USFDA has approved apalutamide on 14 February 2018 as an agent that targets androgen receptor signaling through inhibition causing significant improvement in metastasis-free survival in patients with prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE In this review, various aspects related to apalutamide have been summarized which involve the mechanism of action, chemistry, synthesis, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, adverse reactions, and safety parameters. METHODS The literature was thoroughly searched in the relevant databases to identify studies published in this field during recent years. Special attention has been given to apalutamide clinical trials phases and its promising future as one of the first-line agents for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. RESULTS Ongoing trials are progressing for apalutamide monotherapy and also for its combinations in other disease settings. The expected results of such trials will shape the future scenario of prostate cancer therapy. CONCLUSION This review article has highlighted different aspects of Apalutamide like its mechanism of action, adverse effects, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical trials among others. The contents of this article should make an excellent read for prospective researchers in this field."

BACKGROUND Apalutamide is a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor approved for treatment of subjects with high-risk, non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (NM-CRPC). OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of apalutamide and its metabolite N-desmethyl-apalutamide in healthy male and castration-resistant prostate cancer subjects. METHODS Plasma concentration data for apalutamide and N-desmethyl-apalutamide from 1092 subjects (seven clinical studies) receiving oral apalutamide (30-480 mg) once daily were pooled for a population pharmacokinetic analysis using a non-linear mixed-effect modelling approach. The impact of clinically relevant covariates was also assessed. RESULTS Apalutamide absorption was rapid, and the apparent steady-state volume of distribution was large (276 L), reflecting a wide body distribution. Apalutamide was eliminated slowly, with its apparent clearance increasing from 1.31 L/h after the first dose to 2.04 L/h at steady state. No evidence of time-dependent disposition was observed for N-desmethyl-apalutamide, which was also widely distributed and slowly cleared (1.5 L/h). After 4 weeks of treatment, more than 95% of steady-state exposure of apalutamide and N-desmethyl-apalutamide was reached. At a dose of apalutamide 240 mg/day, apalutamide and N-desmethyl-apalutamide exposure exhibited 5.3- and 85.2-fold accumulation in plasma, respectively. Inter-individual variability in apalutamide apparent clearance is low (< 20%). Among the covariates evaluated, apalutamide and N-desmethyl-apalutamide exposure were statistically associated only with health status, body weight, and albumin concentration, and the effect was low (< 25%). CONCLUSIONS A population pharmacokinetic modelling approach was successfully applied to describe the pharmacokinetics of apalutamide and N-desmethyl-apalutamide. No clinically relevant covariates were identified as predictors of apalutamide and N-desmethyl-apalutamide pharmacokinetics."

PURPOSE Apalutamide plus androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) has been approved for treatment of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) based on data from phase 3 TITAN study. This analysis was conducted to describe pharmacokinetics of apalutamide and N-desmethyl-apalutamide and explore relationships between apalutamide exposure and selected clinical efficacy and safety observations. METHODS 1052 patients were randomized to apalutamide + ADT (n = 525) or placebo + ADT (n = 527). A previously developed population pharmacokinetic model was applied. Cox regression analysis investigated the relationships between apalutamide exposure and overall survival (OS; n = 1004) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS; n = 1003). Logistic regression analysis assessed the relationships between apalutamide exposure and selected clinically relevant adverse events (n = 1051). RESULTS Apalutamide + ADT treatment was efficacious in extending rPFS and OS versus placebo + ADT. Within a relatively narrow apalutamide exposure range (coefficient of variation: 22%), no statistical association was detected between rPFS, OS and apalutamide exposure quartiles. Incidence of skin rash and pruritus increased significantly with increasing apalutamide exposure. CONCLUSIONS Differences in apalutamide exposure were not associated with clinically relevant differences in rPFS or OS in patients with mCSPC. Patients with increased apalutamide exposure are more likely to develop skin rash and pruritus. Dose reductions may improve these adverse events, based on an individual risk-benefit approach."

BACKGROUND Apalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly improved metastasis-free survival (MFS), overall survival (OS), and time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in the placebo-controlled SPARTAN study of high-risk nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). OBJECTIVE To assess the relationships between PSA kinetics, outcomes, and molecular subtypes in SPARTAN. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The authors conducted a post hoc analysis of nmCRPC patients randomized to receive apalutamide (n = 806) or placebo (n = 401) plus ADT and a subset stratified by molecular classifiers. INTERVENTION Apalutamide 240 mg/d. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The association between PSA kinetics and MFS, OS, time to PSA progression, and molecular subtypes was evaluated using the landmark analysis and Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS By 3 mo, PSA decreased in most apalutamide-treated patients and increased in most placebo-treated patients. After apalutamide, the median time to PSA nadir, confirmed \u226550% PSA reduction, \u226590% PSA reduction, and PSA \u22640.2 ng/ml were 7.4, 1.0, 1.9, and 2.8 mo, respectively. By 6 mo, 90%, 57%, and 32% of apalutamide patients had \u226550% PSA reduction, \u226590% PSA reduction, and PSA \u22640.2 ng/ml, respectively, while only 1.5% of placebo patients experienced \u226550% PSA reduction. PSA reductions were observed within 3 mo and up to 12 mo of apalutamide treatment, and were similar across molecular subtypes. Deep PSA responses (\u226590% PSA reduction or PSA \u22640.2 ng/ml) at landmark 6-mo apalutamide treatment were significantly associated with improved time to PSA progression (hazard ratio {HR} [95% confidence interval {CI}] 0.25 [0.18-0.33] or 0.13 [0.08-0.21]), MFS (0.41 [0.29-0.57] or 0.3 [0.19-0.47]), and OS (0.45 [0.35-0.59] or 0.26 [0.18-0.38]; p < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS Apalutamide plus ADT produced rapid, deep, and durable PSA responses by 6-mo treatment regardless of assessed molecular prognostic markers. An early PSA response with apalutamide was associated with clinical benefits, supporting prognostic value of PSA monitoring. PATIENT SUMMARY In this report, we describe how prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels relate to outcomes in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with apalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We found that treatment with apalutamide plus ADT resulted in rapid, deep, and durable PSA responses in the majority of patients, including those with high-risk molecular subtypes, which were associated with improved survival."

The antiandrogen therapeutics apalutamide and darolutamide entered the clinic in 2018 and 2019, respectively, for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Increased expression of the enzyme aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) is phenotypic of CRPC. The enzyme acts to circumvent castration by producing potent androgens that drive proliferation. Furthermore, AKR1C3 mediates chemotherapeutic resistance to the standard of care, enzalutamide, a structural analogue of apalutamide. Resistance develops in almost all CRPC patients within three months of beginning treatment. Herein, we report that both apalutamide and the structurally distinct darolutamide induce AKR1C3 expression in in vitro models of prostate cancer and are susceptible to AKR1C3-mediated resistance. This effect is countered by pretreatment with a potent and highly selective AKR1C3 inhibitor, sensitizing high AKR1C3 expressing prostate cancer cell lines to the action of both chemotherapeutics with a concomitant reduction in expression of AKR1C3 and the biomarker prostate-specific antigen."

The Fc receptor CD16 is present on essentially all CD56(dim) peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cells. Upon recognition of antibody-coated cells it delivers a potent signal to NK cells, which eliminate targets through direct killing and cytokine production. Here we investigated the regulation of CD16 surface expression after NK cell activation. Cytokine activation and target cell stimulation led to marked decreases in CD16 expression. Activation of CD56(dim) NK cells by cross-linking CD16 with antibodies resulted in a loss of CD16 and CD62L, which correlated with increased interferon-\u03b3 production. A disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 (ADAM17) is shown to be expressed by NK cells, and its selective inhibition abrogated CD16 and CD62L shedding, and led to enhanced interferon-\u03b3 production, especially when triggering was delivered through CD16. Fc-induced production of cytokines by NK cells exposed to rituximab-coated B cell targets was also enhanced by ADAM17 inhibition. This supports an important role for targeting ADAM17 to prevent CD16 shedding and improve the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. Our findings demonstrate that over-activation of ADAM17 in NK cells may be detrimental to their effector functions by down-regulating surface expression of CD16 and CD62L."

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate cytotoxic lymphocytes that can recognize assorted determinants on tumor cells and rapidly kill these cells. Due to their anti-tumor effector functions and potential for allogeneic use, various NK cell platforms are being examined for adoptive cell therapies. However, their limited in vivo persistence is a current challenge. Cytokine-mediated activation of these cells is under extensive investigation and interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a particular focus since it drives their activation and proliferation. IL-15 efficacy though is limited in part by its induction of regulatory checkpoints. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) is broadly expressed by leukocytes, including NK cells, and it plays a central role in cleaving cell surface receptors, a process that regulates cell activation and cell-cell interactions. We report that ADAM17 blockade with a monoclonal antibody markedly increased human NK cell proliferation by IL-15 both in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. Blocking ADAM17 resulted in a significant increase in surface levels of the homing receptor CD62L on proliferating NK cells. We show that NK cell proliferation in vivo by IL-15 and the augmentation of this process upon blocking ADAM17 are dependent on CD62L. Hence, our findings reveal for the first time that ADAM17 activation in NK cells by IL-15 limits their proliferation, presumably functioning as a feedback system, and that its substrate CD62L has a key role in this process in vivo. ADAM17 blockade in combination with IL-15 may provide a new approach to improve NK cell persistence and function in cancer patients."

Human NK cell antitumor activities involve Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is a key mechanism of action for several clinically successful tumor-targeting therapeutic mAbs. Human NK cells exclusively recognize these Abs by the Fc\u03b3 receptor CD16A (Fc\u03b3RIIIA), one of their most potent activating receptors. Unlike other activating receptors on NK cells, CD16A undergoes a rapid down-regulation in expression by a proteolytic process following NK cell activation with various stimuli. In this review, the role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) in CD16A cleavage and as a regulatory checkpoint is discussed. Several studies have examined the effects of inhibiting ADAM17 or CD16A cleavage directly during NK cell engagement of Ab-coated tumor cells, which resulted in strengthened Ab tethering, decreased tumor cell detachment, and enhanced CD16A signaling and cytokine production. However, the effects of either manipulation on ADCC have varied between studies, which may be due to dissimilar assays and the contribution of different killing processes by NK cells. Of importance is that NK cells under various circumstances, including in the tumor microenvironment of patients, down-regulate CD16A and this appears to impair their function. Considerable progress has been made in the development of ADAM17 inhibitors, including human mAbs that have advantages of high specificity and increased half-life in vivo. These inhibitors may provide a therapeutic means of increasing ADCC potency and/or antitumor cytokine production by NK cells in an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and if used in combination with tumor-targeting Abs or NK cell-based adoptive immunotherapies may improve their efficacy."

BACKGROUND/AIM The inhibition of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) has the potential to become a novel approach for natural killer (NK) cell-based cancer immunotherapy. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibitors on expanded NK cell to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in breast cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS NK cells were expanded in medium supplemented with an ADAM10 or ADAM17 inhibitor to prevent the shedding of soluble CD16/Fc\u03b3RIII. The expression level of CD16 and production of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) was detected by flow cytometry using specific antibodies. ADCC activity of expanded NK cells was estimated in trastuzumab treated breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, and BT-474 cells. RESULTS The ADAM17 inhibitor increased the purity of expanded NK cells to 90% after 14 days at 5 and 10 \u03bcM in vitro (p=0.043). However, the expansion rate of NK cells was decreased at 10 \u03bcM of the ADAM 17 inhibitor (p=0.043). Inhibition of ADAM10 suppressed the expansion of NK cells, although the NK purity was increased at 1 \u03bcM of the inhibitor. The expression of CD16 was significantly increased at 1 and 5 \u03bcM of the ADAM17 inhibitor (p=0.046, 0.028, respectively) during the culturing period. Inhibition of ADAM10 reduced the expression of CD16 on NK cells. The cytotoxic activity of the ADAM17 inhibitor treated NK cells against MCF-7 (p=0.039) and BT-474 (p=0.027) cells was significantly elevated. The ADCC activity of NK cells treated with 5 \u03bcM of ADAM17 inhibitor was significantly increased against SKBR-3 and BT-474 (p=0.027). Inhibition of ADAM17 increased the production of IFN-\u03b3 in expanded NK cells. CONCLUSION The inhibition of ADAM17 enhanced the purity of expanded NK cells and the ADCC activity of these cells against trastuzumab treated breast cancer cell lines."

Unlike other NK cell activating receptors, the cell surface density of CD16A can be rapidly downregulated in a cis manner by the metalloproteinase ADAM17 following NK cell stimulation in various manners. CD16A downregulation takes place in cancer patients and this may affect the efficacy of tumor-targeting mAbs. We examined the effects of MEDI3622, a human mAb and potent ADAM17 inhibitor, on NK cell activation by antibody-bound tumor cells. MEDI3622 effectively blocked ADAM17 function in NK cells and caused a marked increase in their production of IFN\u03b3. This was observed for NK cells exposed to different tumor cell lines and therapeutic antibodies, and over a range of effector/target ratios. The augmented release of IFN\u03b3 by NK cells was reversed by a function-blocking CD16A mAb. In addition, NK92 cells, a human NK cell line that lacks endogenous Fc\u03b3Rs, expressing a recombinant non-cleavable version of CD16A released significantly higher levels of IFN\u03b3 than NK92 cells expressing equivalent levels of wildtype CD16A.

These interdependent pathways are essential components of the signaling network that links liver function with the compensatory growth that occurs during liver regeneration following 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) or chemically induced hepatotoxicity. Despite identification of many soluble factors needed for efficient liver regeneration, very little is known about how such ligands are regulated in the liver. To directly study the role of ADAM17 in the liver, we employed two cell-specific ADAM17 knockout (KO) mouse models. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a robust stimulus for TNF release, we found attenuated levels of circulating TNF in myeloid-specific ADAM17 KO mice (ADAM17 m-KO) and, unexpectedly, in mice with hepatocyte-specific ADAM17 deletion (ADAM17 h-KO), indicating that ADAM17 expression in both cell types plays a role in TNF shedding. After 2/3 PH, induction of TNF, TNFR1, and amphiregulin (AR) was significantly attenuated in ADAM17 h-KO mice, implicating ADAM17 as the primary sheddase for these factors in the liver. Surprisingly, the extent and timing of hepatocyte proliferation were not affected after PH or carbon tetrachloride injection in ADAM17 h-KO or ADAM17 m-KO mice. We conclude that ADAM17 regulates TNF, TNFR1, and AR in the liver, and its expression in both hepatocytes and myeloid cells is important for TNF regulation after LPS injury or 2/3 PH, but is not required for liver regeneration."

ADAM17, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17, is a transmembrane metalloproteinase that regulates bioavailability of multiple membrane-bound proteins via ectodomain shedding. ADAM17 activity was shown to contribute to a number of vascular pathologies, but its role in the context of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not determined. We found that expression and enzymatic activity of ADAM17 are upregulated in human diabetic postmortem retinas and a mouse model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To further investigate the contribution of ADAM17 to vascular alterations associated with DR, we used human retinal endothelial cells (HREC) treated with ADAM17 neutralizing antibodies and exposed to glucidic stress and streptozotocin-induced endothelial ADAM17 knockout mice. Evaluation of vascular permeability, vascular inflammation, and oxidative stress was performed. Loss of ADAM17 in endothelial cells markedly reduced oxidative stress evidenced by decreased levels of superoxide, 3-nitrotyrosine, and 4-hydroxynonenal and decreased leukocyte-endothelium adhesive interactions in vivo and in vitro. Reduced leukostasis was associated with decreased vascular permeability and was accompanied by downregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression. Reduction in oxidative stress in HREC was associated with downregulation of NAD(P)H oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression. Our data suggest a role for endothelial ADAM17 in DR pathogenesis and identify ADAM17 as a potential new therapeutic target for DR."

OBJECTIVE To identify factors predicting response (2-hour headache pain freedom or most bothersome symptom freedom) to lasmiditan based on individual patient characteristics, migraine disease characteristics, and migraine attack characteristics. Further, efficacy specifically in difficult-to-treat patient/migraine disease characteristics or attack characteristics (ie, historically considered less responsive to certain acute therapies) subgroups was analyzed. BACKGROUND Knowledge of factors associated with a positive or negative response to acute treatment would be useful to practitioners prescribing acute treatments for migraine. Additionally, practitioners and patients would benefit from understanding the efficacy of lasmiditan specifically in subgroups of patients with migraine disease characteristics and migraine attack characteristics historically associated with decreased pain threshold, reduced efficacy of acute treatment, or increased burden of migraine. METHODS Pooled analyses were completed from 2 Phase 3 double-blind clinical trials, SPARTAN and SAMURAI. Data from baseline to 2 hours after taking lasmiditan (50, 100, or 200 mg) or placebo were analyzed to assess efficacy based on patient characteristics, migraine disease characteristics, and migraine attack characteristics. A total of 3981 patients comprising the intent-to-treat population were treated with placebo (N = 1130), lasmiditan 50 mg (N = 598), lasmiditan 100 mg (N = 1133), or lasmiditan 200 mg (N = 1120). Data were analyzed for the following efficacy measures at 2 hours: headache pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom. RESULTS None of the analyzed subgroups based on individual patient characteristics, migraine disease characteristics, or migraine attack characteristics predicted headache pain freedom or most bothersome symptom freedom response at 2 hours following lasmiditan treatment (interaction P \u2265 .1). For the difficult-to-treat patient/migraine disease characteristics subgroups (defined as those with \u226524 headache days in the past 3 months, duration of migraine history \u226520 years, severe disability [Migraine Disability Assessment score \u226521], obesity [\u226530 kg/m2 ], and history of psychiatric disorder), single doses of lasmiditan (100 or 200 mg) were significantly more effective than placebo (P \u2264 .002) in achieving both endpoints. Headache pain freedom response rates for higher doses of lasmiditan were numerically greater than for lower doses of lasmiditan. For the difficult-to-treat migraine attack subgroups, patients with severe headache, co-existent nausea at the time of treatment, or who delayed treatment for \u22652 hours from the time of headache onset, both endpoint response rates after lasmiditan 100 or 200 mg were significantly greater than after placebo. Among those who delayed treatment for \u22654 hours from the time of headache onset, headache pain freedom response rates for the 200 mg dose of lasmiditan met statistical significance vs placebo (32.4% vs 15.9%; odds ratio = 2.7 [1.17, 6.07]; P = .018). While the predictors of response interaction test showed similar efficacy of lasmiditan vs placebo across subgroups defined by baseline functional disability (mild, moderate, or needs complete bed rest) at the time of treatment, analyses of lasmiditan efficacy within the subgroup \"needs complete bed rest\" appeared to show less efficacy (eg, in the 200 mg vs placebo group, 25.9% vs 18.5%; odds ratio = 1.56 [0.96, 2.53]; P = .070). CONCLUSIONS Efficacy of lasmiditan 200 and 100 mg for headache pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at 2 hours post-treatment was generally not influenced by the individual patient characteristics, migraine disease history, or migraine attack characteristics that were analyzed. In the analyses of difficult-to-treat subgroups, patients receiving lasmiditan achieved greater responses (2-hour headache pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom) vs placebo recipients."

OBJECTIVE To study the efficacy and safety of lasmiditan for acute treatment of migraine in patients using migraine preventive medications. BACKGROUND While lasmiditan has been proven to be an effective acute treatment for migraine, its effectiveness has not been examined when used concurrently with migraine preventives. METHODS SAMURAI and SPARTAN were similarly designed, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies of patients 18 years or older with 3 to 8 migraine attacks per month. Patients were randomized to treat a migraine attack with oral lasmiditan 50 mg (SPARTAN only), 100 mg, 200 mg, or placebo. Migraine preventives were allowed as long as doses were stable for 3 months prior to screening and were unchanged during the study. Preventive medications with established or probable efficacy, as recommended by the American Academy of Neurology, the American Headache Society, and the European Headache Federation, plus botulinum toxin type A and candesartan, were included. Within the subgroups of patients using and not using preventive therapies, lasmiditan and placebo groups were analyzed for the outcome of pain-free at 2 h and other efficacy outcomes. The subgroups of patients using and not using preventive therapies were compared and interaction p-values were calculated for safety and efficacy outcomes. RESULTS In these trials, 698 of 3981 patients (17.5%) used migraine preventive treatments. Among patients using preventives, all lasmiditan doses resulted in significantly more patients being pain-free at 2 h, compared to placebo (p < 0.05). Primary efficacy outcome (pain-free at 2 h), key secondary outcome (most bothersome symptom-free at 2 h) and all other efficacy outcomes were not significantly different between patients using or not using migraine preventives (all interaction p-values \u22650.1).

Two RCTs in the phase II development of lasmiditan was reviewed. In the intravenous placebo-controlled RCT, lasmiditan doses of 2.5-45 mg were used, and there was a linear association between headache relief (HR) rates and dose levels (P < 0.02). For lasmiditan 20 mg, HR was 64 % and for placebo it was 45 % (NS). In the oral placebo-controlled RCT, lasmiditan doses of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg were used. For HR, all doses of lasmiditan were superior to placebo (P < 0.05). For lasmiditan 400 mg, HR was 64 % and it was 25 % for placebo. Adverse events (AEs) emerging from the treatment were reported by 22 % of the patients receiving placebo and by 65, 73, 87 and 87 % of patients receiving 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg, respectively. The majority of AEs after lasmiditan 100 and 400 mg were moderate or severe. For the understanding of migraine pathophysiology, it is very important to note that a selective 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist like lasmiditan is effective in the acute treatment of migraine. Thus, migraine can be treated with a drug that has no vasoconstrictor ability. While lasmiditan most likely is effective in the treatment of migraine attacks it had, unfortunately, a high incidence of CNS related AEs in the oral RCT. If confirmed in larger studies in phase III, this might adversely limit the use of this highly specific non-vascular acute treatment of migraine. Larger studies including the parameters of patients' preferences are necessary to accurately position this new treatment principle in relation to the triptans."

BACKGROUND Medication overuse is a significant issue that complicates the treatment of headache disorders. The most effective medications for the acute treatment of migraine all have the capacity to induce medication overuse headache (MOH). Novel acute migraine-specific treatments are being developed. However, because the mechanism(s) underlying medication overuse headache are not well understood, it is difficult to predict whether any particular acute medication will induce MOH in susceptible individuals. LY573144 (lasmiditan), a 5-HT1F receptor agonist, has recently been shown to be effective in the acute treatment of migraine in phase 3 trials. The aim of this study is to determine whether frequent administration of lasmiditan induces behaviors consistent with MOH in a pre-clinical rat model. METHODS Sprague Dawley rats were administered six doses of lasmiditan (10 mg/kg), sumatriptan (10 mg/kg), or sterile water orally over 2 weeks and cutaneous allodynia was evaluated regularly in the periorbital and hindpaw regions using von Frey filaments. Testing continued until mechanosensitivity returned to baseline levels. Rats were then submitted to bright light stress (BLS) or nitric oxide (NO) donor administration and were again evaluated for cutaneous allodynia in the periorbital and hindpaw regions hourly for 5 hours. RESULTS Both lasmiditan and sumatriptan exhibited comparable levels of drug-induced cutaneous allodynia in both the periorbital and hindpaw regions, which resolved after cessation of drug administration. Both lasmiditan and sumatriptan pre-treatment resulted in cutaneous allodynia that was evoked by either BLS or NO donor. CONCLUSIONS In a pre-clinical rat model of MOH, oral lasmiditan, like sumatriptan, induced acute transient cutaneous allodynia in the periorbital and hindpaw regions that after resolution could be re-evoked by putative migraine triggers. These results suggest that lasmiditan has the capacity to induce MOH through persistent latent peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms."

Objective: To review the efficacy and safety of the newly Food and Drug Administration approved drug lasmiditan, and its place in therapy in the treatment of acute migraine attacks. Data Sources: A literature search of Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar was preformed (September 1999 to May 2021) using the following search terms: acute migraine treatment, triptans, lasmiditan, Reyvow, Rimegepant, Nurtec, Ubrogepant, Ubrelvy, migraine, vasoconstriction, and cardiovascular risk. Product labeling, https://www.clinicaltriasl.gov, and product monographs were also reviewed. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Relevant English-language studies were considered. Data Synthesis: Lasmiditan is the first in its class approved for acute migraine treatment. Lasmiditan exerts its therapeutic effect through agonism at the 5-HT1F receptor, which has been shown to produce no vasoconstriction in preclinical models. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: It is both scientifically and clinically relevant to review lasmiditan and determine the value of an acute migraine drug that does not induce vasoconstriction. Patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions for which current migraine therapy is contraindicated may benefit from therapeutic use of lasmiditan. However, the potential cardiovascular benefit needs to be weighed against the increased central nervous system risks observed with lasmiditan. Conclusions: Lasmiditan is an oral tablet drug that is used for acute migraine abortive treatment and data suggest that it does not induce vasoconstriction, a common side effect often observed with the current first-line abortive migraine treatment drug class, triptans. This is especially important in acute migraine patients with cardiovascular risk factors in which triptan use is contraindicated."

BACKGROUND Migraine has a great impact on public health. Current acute therapies do not satisfy all migraineurs. The novel serotonin 5-HT1F receptor agonist appears more promising for aborting migraine attacks. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of lasmiditan in treating acute migraine attacks. METHODS The literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which assessed the effect and safety of lasmiditan on migraine. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Results were extracted and pooled as risk ratios (RRs) with a fixed or random-effects model. RESULTS Based on the four included RCTs, pooled estimates showed that lasmiditan with the 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg doses was superior to placebo at 2 h after the first dose in terms of pain freedom, absence of migraine-associated symptoms, headache relief, no/mild disability, and global impression of change (very much/much better) (RRs ranged from 1.13 to 1.96), except for nausea-free and vomiting-free. Both lasmiditan 100 mg and 200 mg resulted in significantly fewer patients using rescue medication (100 mg: RR = 0.75, 95% CI (0.61, 0.92), P = 0.007; 200 mg: RR = 0.81, 95% CI (0.66, 0.99), P = 0.04) at 2-24 h postdose, compared with placebo. Safety data showed that the proportion of patients reporting at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and the incidence of most common TEAEs such as dizziness, paresthesia, fatigue, somnolence, and nausea was higher in the lasmiditan groups (50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg), compared with placebo. There was no significant difference between lasmiditan and placebo in terms of cardiovascular-related TEAEs (RR = 2.75, 95% CI (0.81, 9.37), P = 0.11). Compared with lasmiditan 100 mg, lasmiditan 200 mg was more effective in pain freedom at 2 h after the first dose (RR = 0.83, 95% CI (0.74, 0.94), P = 0.004) but associated with a higher risk of reporting at least one TEAE (RR = 0.88, 95% CI (0.81, 0.96), P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS Lasmiditan with the 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg doses are effective and safe in acute migraine treatment. Lasmiditan 200 mg is more effective than lasmiditan 100 mg in pain freedom, while lasmiditan 100 mg is better tolerated in the short-term follow-up.

INTRODUCTION Lasmiditan (COL-144; LY573144) is a novel, highly selective and potent agonist at 5-HT(1F) receptors that lacks vasoconstrictor activity. Preclinical and early clinical experiments predict acute antimigraine efficacy of COL-144 that is mediated through a non-vascular, primarily neural, mechanism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In a randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, group-sequential, adaptive treatment-assignment, proof-of-concept and dose-finding study, we treated 130 subjects in-hospital during a migraine attack. Subjects were allocated to an intravenous dose level of lasmiditan or placebo in small cohorts. The starting dose was 2.5 mg. Subsequent doses were adjusted, up or down, according to the safety and efficacy seen in the preceding cohort. The primary outcome measure was headache response defined as improvement from moderate or severe headache at baseline to mild or no headache at 2 h post-dose. The study was designed to explore the overall dose response relationship but was not powered to differentiate individual doses from placebo, nor to detect effect differences for other migraine symptoms. RESULTS Forty-two subjects received placebo and 88 received lasmiditan in doses of 2.5-45 mg. Subjects were observed in the clinic for 4 h after treatment and used a diary card to record symptoms and adverse events for up to 24 h. The study was terminated when the 20 mg dose met predefined efficacy stopping rules. Of subjects treated in the 10, 20, 30 and 45 mg lasmiditan dose groups, 54-75% showed a 2 h headache response, compared to 45% in the placebo group (P = 0.0126 for the linear association between response rates and dose levels). Patient global impression at 2 h and lack of need for rescue medication also showed statistically significant linear correlations with dose. Lasmiditan was generally well tolerated. Adverse events were reported by 65% of subjects on lasmiditan and by 43% on placebo and were generally mild. Dizziness, paresthesia and sensations of heaviness (usually limb) were more common on lasmiditan. CONCLUSIONS At intravenous doses of 20 mg and higher, lasmiditan proved effective in the acute treatment of migraine. Further studies to assess the optimal oral dose and full efficacy and tolerability profile are under way. The non-vascular, neural mechanism of action of lasmiditan may offer an alternative means to treat migraine especially in patients who have contra-indications for agents with vasoconstrictor activity.

Potocki-Shaffer syndrome is a rare contiguous gene deletion syndrome due to haploinsufficiency of the 11p11.2p12 region and is characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, developmental delay, intellectual disability, multiple exostoses, and biparietal foramina. In this study, six patients with the Potocki-Shaffer syndrome were identified and evaluated using a multidisciplinary protocol that included assessments by a geneticist, ophthalmologist, otolaryngologist, orthopedist, nephrologist, audiologist, and neuropsychologist. Diagnostic studies included skeletal survey, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, renal ultrasound, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid studies, and urinalysis. Using array comparative genomic hybridization, we further characterized the deletion in five of these patients. The results of these evaluations were combined with a comprehensive review of reported cases. Our data highlight the characteristic facial features, biparietal foramina, moderate-to-severe developmental delay and intellectual disability, myopia and strabismus, and multiple exostoses seen with this disorder. We also identify for the first time an association of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome with sensorineural hearing loss and autistic behaviors. Finally, we provide recommendations for the health maintenance of patients with Potocki-Shaffer syndrome."

Potocki-Shaffer Syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome associated with microdeletion of a region of Chromosome 11p11.2. Genetic evidence has implicated haploinsufficiency of PHF21A, a gene that encodes a histone-binding protein, as the likely cause of intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities in Potocki-Shaffer Syndrome. However, the molecular consequences of reduced PHF21A expression remain elusive. In this study, we analyzed by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) two patient-derived cell lines with heterozygous loss of PHF21A compared to unaffected individuals and identified 1,885 genes that were commonly misregulated. The patient cells displayed down-regulation of key pathways relevant to learning and memory, including Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP)-signaling pathway genes. We found that PHF21A is required for full induction of a luciferase reporter carrying cAMP-responsive elements (CRE) following stimulation by the cAMP analog, forskolin. Finally, PHF21A-deficient patient-derived cells exhibited a delayed induction of immediate early genes following forskolin stimulation. These results suggest that an impaired response to cAMP signaling might be involved in the pathology of PHF21A deficiency.

Potocki-Shaffer syndrome is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving 11p11.2p12 and characterized by multiple exostoses, biparietal foramina, genitourinary anomalies in males, central nervous system abnormalities, intellectual disability, and craniofacial abnormalities. Current literature implicates haploinsufficiency of three genes (ALX4, EXT2, and PHF21A) in causing some of the cardinal features of PSS. We report a patient with multiple exostoses, biparietal foramina, and history of mild developmental delay. Cognitive and behavioral testing supported formal diagnoses of anxiety, verbal dyspraxia, articulation disorder, and coordination disorder, without intellectual disability. His facial features, though distinctive, were not typical of those observed in PSS. As the chromosomal deletion does not encompass PHF21A, this case lends further support that haploinsufficiency of PHF21A contributes to the intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities in PSS and that there are other genes in the region which likely contribute to the behavioral phenotype in this syndrome. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The exotoxins toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) are produced by the bacterial pathogen Clostridium difficile and are responsible for the pathology associated with C. difficile infection (CDI). The antitoxin antibodies actoxumab and bezlotoxumab bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. Bezlotoxumab was recently approved by the FDA for reducing the recurrence of CDI. We have previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain, preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization. Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques, we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189 and 2410-2437. Actoxumab binding caused the aggregation of TcdA especially at higher antibody:toxin concentration ratios. Actoxumab prevented the association of TcdA with target cells demonstrating that actoxumab neutralizes toxin activity by inhibiting the first step of the intoxication cascade. This mechanism of neutralization is similar to that observed with bezlotoxumab and TcdB. Comparisons of the putative TcdA epitope sequences across several C. difficile ribotypes and homologous repeat sequences within TcdA suggest a structural basis for observed differences in actoxumab binding and/or neutralization potency. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the protective effects of the antibody in vitro and in vivo, including in various preclinical models of CDI."

Although individual serum and mucosal antibody responses to C. difficile enterotoxin (toxin A) vary, one-third of patients with C. difficile diarrhea develop neutralizing serum antibodies. IgA in the serum, not IgG, is typically responsible for this neutralization, suggesting a unique role for serum IgA in response to C. difficile infection, an infection that is usually limited to the intestinal mucosa.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) represents the most prevalent cause of antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal infections in health care facilities in the developed world. Disease symptoms are caused by the two homologous exotoxins, TcdA and TcdB. Standard therapy for CDI involves administration of antibiotics that are associated with a high rate of disease recurrence, highlighting the need for novel treatment paradigms that target the toxins rather than the organism itself. A combination of human monoclonal antibodies, actoxumab and bezlotoxumab, directed against TcdA and TcdB, respectively, has been shown to decrease the rate of recurrence in patients treated with standard-of-care antibiotics. However, the exact mechanism of antibody-mediated protection is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the antitoxin antibodies are protective in multiple murine models of CDI, including systemic and local (gut) toxin challenge models, as well as primary and recurrent models of infection in mice. Systemically administered actoxumab-bezlotoxumab prevents both the damage to the gut wall and the inflammatory response, which are associated with C. difficile in these models, including in mice challenged with a strain of the hypervirulent ribotype 027. Furthermore, mutant antibodies (N297Q) that do not bind to Fc\u03b3 receptors provide a level of protection similar to that of wild-type antibodies, demonstrating that the mechanism of protection is through direct neutralization of the toxins and does not involve host effector functions.

Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) dramatically increased during the last decade and cause a major public health problem. Current treatments are limited by the high disease recurrence rate, severity of clinical forms, disruption of the gut microbiota, and colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In this review, we resumed current treatment options from official recommendation to promising alternatives available in the management of adult CDI, with regard to severity and recurring or non-recurring character of the infection. Vancomycin remains the first-line antibiotic in the management of mild to severe CDI. The use of metronidazole is discussed following the latest US recommendations that replaced it by fidaxomicin as first-line treatment of an initial episode of non-severe CDI. Fidaxomicin, the most recent antibiotic approved for CDI in adults, has several advantages compared to vancomycin and metronidazole, but its efficacy seems limited in cases of multiple recurrences. Innovative therapies such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and antitoxin antibodies were developed to limit the occurrence of recurrence of CDI.

Clostridium difficile causes infections of the colon in susceptible patients. Specifically, gut dysbiosis induced by treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics facilitates germination of ingested C. difficile spores, expansion of vegetative cells, and production of symptom-causing toxins TcdA and TcdB. The current standard of care for C. difficile infections (CDI) consists of administration of antibiotics such as vancomycin that target the bacterium but also perpetuate gut dysbiosis, often leading to disease recurrence. The monoclonal antitoxin antibodies actoxumab (anti-TcdA) and bezlotoxumab (anti-TcdB) are currently in development for the prevention of recurrent CDI. In this study, the effects of vancomycin or actoxumab/bezlotoxumab treatment on progression and resolution of CDI were assessed in mice and hamsters. Rodent models of CDI are characterized by an early severe phase of symptomatic disease, associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality; high intestinal C. difficile burden; and a disrupted intestinal microbiota. This is followed in surviving animals by gradual recovery of the gut microbiota, associated with clearance of C. difficile and resolution of disease symptoms over time. Treatment with vancomycin prevents disease initially by inhibiting outgrowth of C. difficile but also delays microbiota recovery, leading to disease relapse following discontinuation of therapy. In contrast, actoxumab/bezlotoxumab treatment does not impact the C. difficile burden but rather prevents the appearance of toxin-dependent symptoms during the early severe phase of disease, effectively preventing disease until the microbiota (the body's natural defense against C. difficile) has fully recovered. These data provide insight into the mechanism of recurrence following vancomycin administration and into the mechanism of recurrence prevention observed clinically with actoxumab/bezlotoxumab."

PURPOSE To investigate corneal clearance time using a topical rho-kinase inhibitor, netarsudil, after descemetorhexis without endothelial keratoplasty (DWEK). METHODS Twenty eyes from 10 patients with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy had DWEK with cataract surgery. For the first eye of each participant, netarsudil was administered immediately after surgery until corneal clearance. For the second eye, netarsudil was withheld 2 weeks beyond the time for corneal clearance of the first eye and then administered only if corneal edema was still present. Interpatient and intrapatient comparisons were made for pachymetry, endothelial cell count, intraocular pressure, and time to corneal clearance. RESULTS Intrapatient comparison demonstrated no significant difference in preoperative pachymetry (P value 0.58), endothelial cell counts (P value 0.97), and intraocular pressure (P value 0.46) between eyes treated with netarsudil immediately after DWEK and those with delayed netarsudil use. Average time for corneal clearance in eyes treated with netarsudil immediately after surgery was 4.6 \u00b1 1.7 weeks, which was significantly shorter than eyes not treated with netarsudil immediately at 8 \u00b1 1.9 weeks (P < 0.01). Corneal clearance occurred in eyes between 1 and 2 weeks after addition of netarsudil as a \"rescue\" drop. Interpatient comparison demonstrated significantly greater endothelial cell counts in eyes treated with netarsudil immediately compared with eyes with a delay in netarsudil use (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Netarsudil significantly reduces the time to corneal clearance after DWEK. Furthermore, increased endothelial cell counts in eyes with immediate netarsudil use versus delayed netarsudil use suggests that the immediate perioperative period is crucial in cell regeneration and migration."

PURPOSE To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effects of netarsudil on goniotomy-treated eyes versus goniotomy-na\u00efve control eyes. METHODS Retrospective cohort study of 70 eyes from 49 adult glaucoma patients treated with netarsudil. Thirty-five eyes received sectoral goniotomy using Kahook Dual Blade (KDB) combined with cataract surgery with minimum of 3 months prior to netarsudil treatment. Thirty-five eyes in the control cohort received only cataract surgery prior to netarsudil. Primary outcome was treatment success, defined as \u2265 20% decrease in IOP at minimum 1 month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included percent of IOP reduction, adverse effects of medication, medication discontinuation rate, and relationship between KDB goniotomy response and netarsudil response. RESULTS Eighty-three percent of KDB-treated eyes achieved netarsudil treatment success compared to 54% of control eyes (P = .012). IOP reduction was 30.3 \u00b1 16.2% (IQR 21-38%) in KDB-treated eyes and 19.4 \u00b1 12.4% (IQR 9.2-30.8) in control eyes (P = .007). History of prior KDB increased the likelihood of success to netarsudil treatment compared to eyes without prior KDB, regardless of surgical response to KDB (odds ratio 4.51, 95% CI 1.34-15.14, P = .015). The overall rate of adverse effects of netarsudil was 42%, most commonly reported as conjunctival hyperemia, allergy, and blurred vision. CONCLUSIONS Netarsudil had a greater IOP-lowering effect in eyes treated with prior goniotomy and may serve as a promising adjunctive ocular hypotensive agent to further reduce IOP in eyes with prior goniotomy."

Netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% is a new treatment for open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, which was approved for treatment in the United States and in the European Commission. The drug is a rho- kinase inhibitor (ROCK) that lowers intraocular pressure by enhancing the outflow at the trabecular meshwork and decreasing both aqueous humor production and episcleral venous pressure. This literature review aims to present this new treatment, characterize its specific mechanism of action, and discuss its effect and adverse events profile. The efficacy and safety of the drug were studied in the ROCKET and MERCURY clinical trials, in which Netarsudil was compared to other common drugs, including Timolol (Beta-blocker), Latanoprost (Prostaglandin analog), and a combination drop containing Netarsudil and Latanoprost. These trials showed a reduction of 16%-21% in the intraocular pressure (IOP) when using Netarsudil. Moreover, it was found that when using a combination of Netarsudil and Latanoprost, 64.5% of these patients achieved \u226530% reduction in mean diurnal IOP versus 28.8% of patients treated only with Netarsudil and 37.2% of patients treated only with Latanoprost (P<0.0001).

PURPOSE Netarsudil, an inhibitor of Rho kinase and a norepinephrine transporter, has been shown to lower elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in controlled studies of patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, and in healthy volunteers. The mechanism of this ocular hypotensive effect in humans is unknown. METHODS The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of netarsudil 0.02% on aqueous humor dynamics (AHD) parameters. In this double-masked, vehicle-controlled, paired-eye comparison study, 11 healthy volunteers received topical netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% or its vehicle once daily for 7 days (morning dosing). The primary endpoints were the change in AHD parameters, compared between active and vehicle-treated eyes. RESULTS In netarsudil-treated eyes, diurnal outflow facility increased from 0.27 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcL/min/mmHg to 0.33 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcL/min/mmHg (+22%; P = 0.02) after 7 days of treatment. In placebo-treated eyes, diurnal outflow facility did not significantly change (P = 0.94). The difference between netarsudil and placebo eyes in diurnal change of outflow facility was 0.08 \u03bcL/min/mmHg (P < 0.001). Diurnal episcleral venous pressure (EVP) in netarsudil-treated eyes decreased from 7.9 \u00b1 1.2 mmHg to 7.2 \u00b1 1.8 (-10%; P = 0.01). Diurnal EVP was not significantly different between netarsudil- and placebo-treated eyes. There was a trend toward decreasing aqueous humor flow rate (-15%; P = 0.08). No treatment changes were seen in uveoscleral outflow rate. CONCLUSIONS Once-daily dosing of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% lowered IOP through increasing trabecular outflow facility and reducing EVP. This suggests a combination of mechanisms that affect both the proximal and distal outflow pathways."

PRECIS In pooled phase III analyses, once-daily netarsudil 0.02% resulted in intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction that was noninferior to twice-daily timolol 0.5%, with minimal treatment-related serious or systemic adverse events (AEs). Ocular AEs were generally tolerable. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of the Rho kinase inhibitor netarsudil in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS Pooled analysis of data from the ROCKET-1 to 4 phase III studies of once-daily (PM) netarsudil or twice-daily timolol in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The primary efficacy measure was mean IOP at 8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, and 4:00 PM at week 2, week 6, and month 3 in patients with baseline IOP <25 mm Hg. RESULTS In the pooled primary efficacy population (netarsudil, n=494; timolol, n=510), once-daily netarsudil was noninferior to twice-daily timolol at all 9 timepoints through month 3. Mean treated IOP ranged from 16.4 to 18.1 mm Hg among netarsudil-treated patients and 16.8 to 17.6 mm Hg among timolol-treated patients. In the pooled safety population (n=839 in each treatment group), treatment-related serious AEs occurred at similar frequencies in each treatment group (netarsudil, 0.1%; timolol, 0%). The most common ocular AE, conjunctival hyperemia (netarsudil, 54.4%; timolol, 10.4%), was graded as mild in 77.6% (354/456) of affected netarsudil-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS Once-daily netarsudil resulted in IOP lowering that was noninferior to twice-daily timolol, with tolerable ocular AEs that were generally mild and self-resolving. As a first-in-class agent in the United States, with a novel mechanism of action, netarsudil may provide a useful therapeutic option for patients who would benefit from IOP lowering."

A literature review was also performed to identify other similar reports. RESULTS A total of 10 patients were included in the study. Six patients developed partial punctal stenosis and 4 patients developed complete closure of the puncta in 1 or both eye(s) ipsilateral to the use of the topical medication. None of the patients developed punctal disease on the non-netarsudil side. The time from initiation of netarsudil to the documentation of punctal disease ranged from 5-32.2 months (18.41\u00b19.94). In the patients with complete punctal closure, discontinuation of the topical medication led to clinical reappearance of the punctal opening, ranging from 31-83 days after drug cessation (45.75\u00b121.57). In 8 cases, discontinuation of netarsudil resulted in improved epiphora and degree of punctal stenosis on clinical examination.

PURPOSE Topical netarsudil 0.02% may reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing episcleral venous pressure (EVP), which carries theoretical utility for glaucoma associated with elevated EVP. A role for netarsudil in patients with elevated EVP is evaluated in a pilot investigation using a cohort of individuals with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). METHODS Retrospective study of patients with SWS and glaucoma who were treated with netarsudil. Five patients (six eyes) were identified. Data collected included demographics, visual acuity, IOP, glaucoma medical and surgical treatments, and adverse effects of netarsudil. RESULTS Mean age was 13.6 \u00b1 8.5 years. EVP elevation was presumed based on clinical stigmata and/or historical features. Mean number of baseline glaucoma medications was 3.3 \u00b1 1.2. There was a significant reduction in the IOP at netarsudil initiation (mean 26.2 \u00b1 4.5 mmHg) to 1 month of netarsudil therapy (mean 20.2 \u00b1 3.8 mmHg, p = 0.0283) and latest IOP on netarsudil (mean 17.6 \u00b1 1.4 mmHg, p = 0.0034).

PURPOSE To describe 8 cases of reversible reticular corneal epithelial edema of the cornea that developed after use of the topical Rho-kinase inhibitor netarsudil. METHODS This is a retrospective chart review case series of 8 patients treated with netarsudil at an academic medical center. OBSERVATIONS Patients had predisposing corneal conditions including penetrating keratoplasty, corneal decompensation after trabeculectomy-associated endophthalmitis, congenital glaucoma with Haab striae, aphakic bullous keratopathy, history of Ahmed valve and silicone oil, and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy undergoing Descemet stripping only. One patient did not have clear predisposing corneal disease other than low endothelial cell density and a history of trabeculectomy. All patients developed reticular corneal epithelial edema, which appeared as collections of moderate sized superficial epithelial bullae arranged in a reticular pattern resembling a honeycomb. Most developed these changes within weeks of initiating netarsudil, but unique to this series are 2 cases in which netarsudil was tolerated by the cornea for months before developing reticular corneal epithelial edema after diode laser cyclophotocoagulation. In cases which underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography, the imaging demonstrated that the corneal stroma was not edematous, and the reticular corneal epithelial edema involved both host and donor corneal epithelium in cases of penetrating keratoplasty. This fully resolved in all cases upon cessation of netarsudil, and this series is the first to document resolution via a pattern in which the individual bullae become smaller and more widely spaced apart.

In three double-blind BREATH studies of up to 52 weeks' duration, adding intravenous reslizumab (3 mg/kg, once every 4 weeks) to the current asthma therapy of patients (aged 12-75 years) with eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids resulted in significant reductions in clinical asthma exacerbation frequency and significant improvements in lung function, asthma control and health-related quality of life relative to adding placebo. Pooled data from the two trials of 52 weeks' duration indicated similar benefits with reslizumab across various patient subgroups, including patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Reslizumab was generally well tolerated, with very few recipients experiencing severe or serious treatment-related adverse events. Moreover, in an open-label extension study, continued use of reslizumab for up to 2 years was associated with durable lung function benefit, without any new tolerability concerns.

Eosinophils have long been implicated as playing a central role in the pathophysiology of asthma in many patients, and eosinophilic asthma is now recognized as an important asthma endotype. Eosinophil differentiation, maturation, migration, and survival are primarily under the control of interleukin-5 (IL-5). Reslizumab is a humanized monoclonal (immunoglobulin G4/\u03ba) antibody that binds with high affinity to circulating human IL-5 and downregulates the IL-5 signaling pathway, potentially disrupting the maturation and survival of eosinophils. In 2016, an intravenous formulation of reslizumab was approved in the USA, Canada, and Europe as add-on maintenance treatment for patients aged \u2a7e18 years with severe asthma and with an eosinophilic phenotype. The efficacy of reslizumab as add-on intravenous therapy has been reported in several phase III studies in patients with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated blood eosinophil counts (\u2a7e400 cells/\u00b5l). Compared with placebo, reslizumab was associated with significant improvements in clinical exacerbation rate, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, asthma symptoms and quality of life, and significant reductions in blood eosinophil counts.

METHODS Patients were randomized to receive reslizumab 0.3 or 3.0 mg/kg or placebo administered once every 4 weeks for 16 weeks (total four doses). The primary end point was change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 over 16 weeks. Secondary end points included FVC, forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of FVC (FEF25%-75%), patient-reported control of asthma symptoms, short-acting \u03b2-agonist (SABA) use, blood eosinophil levels, and safety. RESULTS Reslizumab significantly improved FEV1 (difference vs placebo [reslizumab 0.3 and 3.0 mg/kg], 115 mL [95% CI, 16-215; P = .0237] and 160 mL [95% CI, 60-259; P = .0018]). Clinically meaningful increases in FVC (130 mL) and FEF25%-75% (233 mL/s) were observed with reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg. Reslizumab improved scores on the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) vs placebo (greater effects seen with 3.0 mg/kg; P < .05). The minimally important difference was reached for the AQLQ (reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg) but not on the ACQ. Scores on the Asthma Symptom Utility Index and SABA use were improved with reslizumab. The most common adverse events were worsening of asthma, headache, and nasopharyngitis; most events were mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS Reslizumab improved lung function, asthma control and symptoms, and quality of life. It was well tolerated in patients with inadequately controlled asthma (despite standard therapy) and elevated blood eosinophil levels. Overall, the 3.0-mg/kg dose of reslizumab provided greater improvements in asthma outcomes vs the 0.3-mg/kg dose, with comparable safety.

However, these cells have the propensity to leave the blood stream and migrate into inflamed tissues. Eosinophilic inflammation is present in a significant proportion of patients with severe asthma. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects more than 315 million people worldwide, with 10% having severe uncontrolled disease. Although the majority of patients can be efficiently treated, severe asthmatics continue to be uncontrolled and are at risk of exacerbations and even death. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) plays a fundamental role in eosinophil differentiation, maturation, activation and inhibition of apoptosis. Therefore, targeting IL-5 is an appealing approach to the treatment of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Reslizumab, a humanized anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, binds with high affinity to amino acids 89-92 of IL-5 that are critical for binding to IL-5 receptor \u03b1. Two phase III studies have demonstrated that reslizumab administration in adult patients with severe asthma and eosinophilia (\u2265400 cells/\u03bcL) improved lung function, asthma control, and symptoms. Thus, the use of blood eosinophils as a baseline biomarker could help to select patients with severe uncontrolled asthma who are likely to achieve benefits in asthma control with reslizumab.

Background: Spirometric lung age expresses lung function relative to chronological age. It has been effective in encouraging smoking cessation and has been used in the assessment of asthma. Reslizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, is approved as add-on therapy for adults with severe asthma and elevated blood eosinophils. Objective: To assess the effect of reslizumab versus placebo on the change in lung age over 52 weeks and the correlation between change in lung age and quality of life in moderate-to-severe asthma. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients ages 12-75 years with moderate-to-severe, inadequately controlled asthma and elevated blood eosinophils received intravenous reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg or placebo every 4 weeks for 1 year. Spirometry was performed every 4 weeks, and the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) score was assessed at baseline and weeks 16, 32, and 52. Results: Mean improvement in lung-age deficit at week 52 was -8.73 years for reslizumab versus -3.80 years for placebo, a treatment difference of 5 years (p < 0.0001). A statistically significant effect was seen as early as 4 weeks. In AQLQ responders (a \u2265 0.5 increase in AQLQ score), a statistically significant inverse relationship between the change from baseline in lung age and AQLQ score at weeks 16, 32, and 52 was observed among patients treated with reslizumab only. Among lung-age responders (\u22655 years' reduction), a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients on reslizumab achieved \u22650.5 increase in the AQLQ score versus placebo at all time points. Conclusion: Reslizumab reduced lung-age deficit by 5 years in patients with moderate-to-severe inadequately controlled eosinophilic asthma. Improvement in lung age correlated with improved quality of life. Lung age is a simple indication of pulmonary function and could be a valuable tool in asthma education.Clinical trials NCT01287039 and NCT01285323, <ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov\">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>."

BACKGROUND IL-5, a mediator of eosinophil activity, is an important potential treatment target in patients with uncontrolled asthma. The efficacy of reslizumab, a humanized anti-human IL-5 monoclonal antibody, has been characterized in patients with blood eosinophils \u2265 400 cells/\u03bcL. This study further characterizes the efficacy and safety of reslizumab in patients with poorly-controlled asthma, particularly those with eosinophils < 400 cells/\u03bcL. METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to intravenous reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg or placebo once every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. The primary end point was the change in FEV1 from baseline to week 16. Secondary measures included Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7) scores, use of short-acting \u03b2-agonists (SABAs), and FVC. RESULTS Four hundred ninety-two patients received \u2265 1 dose of placebo (n = 97) or reslizumab (n = 395). In the overall population, mean FEV1 change from baseline to week 16 was not significantly different between reslizumab and placebo, and no significant relationship was detected between treatment, baseline blood eosinophils and change in FEV1. In the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophils < 400 cells/\u03bcL, patients treated with reslizumab showed no significant improvement in FEV1 compared with those receiving placebo. In the subgroup with eosinophils \u2265 400 cells/\u03bcL, however, treatment with reslizumab was associated with much larger improvements in FEV1, ACQ-7, rescue SABA use, and FVC compared with the placebo group. Reslizumab was well tolerated, with fewer overall adverse events compared with placebo (55% vs 73%). CONCLUSIONS Reslizumab was well tolerated in patients with inadequately controlled asthma. Clinically meaningful effects on lung function and symptom control were not seen in patients unselected for baseline eosinophils.

Quorum sensing is a signaling mechanism through which bacteria modulate a number of cellular functions (genes), including sporulation, biofilm formation, bacteriocin production, virulence responses, as well as others. Quorum sensing is a mechanism of cell-to-cell communication and is mediated by extracellular chemical signals generated by the bacteria when specific cell densities are reached. When the concentration of the signal (and cell population) is sufficiently high, the target gene or genes are either activated or repressed. Quorum sensing increases the ability of the bacteria to have access to nutrients or to more favorable environmental niches and enhances bacterial defenses against eukaryotic hosts, competing bacteria, and environmental stresses. The physiological and clinical aspects of quorum sensing have received considerable attention and have been studied at the molecular level. Little is known, however, on the role of quorum sensing in food spoilage or in the growth and/or toxin production of pathogens present in food. A number of compounds have been isolated or synthesized that antagonize quorum sensors, and application of these antagonists may potentially be useful in inhibiting the growth or virulence mechanisms of bacteria in different environments, including food. It is important that food microbiologists have an awareness and an understanding of the mechanisms involved in bacterial quorum sensing, since strategies targeting quorum sensing may offer a means to control the growth of undesirable bacteria in foods."

While this debate goes on, it is with a certain degree of irony that microbiologists studying aspects of bacterial community behavior face the same questions. Information regarding two social phenomena exhibited by bacteria, quorum sensing and biofilm development, is reviewed here. These two topics have been inextricably linked, possibly because biofilms and quorum sensing represent two areas in which microbiologists focus on social aspects of bacteria. We will examine what is known about this linkage and discuss areas that might be developed. In addition, we believe that these two aspects of bacterial behavior represent a small part of the social repertoire of bacteria.

The term 'quorum sensing' describes intercellular bacterial communication which regulates bacterial gene expression according to population cell density. Bacteria produce and secrete small molecules, named autoinducers, into the intercellular space. The concentration of these molecules increases as a function of population cell density. Once the concentration of the stimulatory threshold is reached, alteration in gene expression occurs. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria possess different types of quorum sensing systems. Canonical LuxI/R-type/acyl homoserine lactone mediated quorum sensing system is the best studied quorum sensing circuit and is described in Gram-negative bacteria which employ it for inter-species communication mostly. Gram-positive bacteria possess a peptide-mediated quorum sensing system. Bacteria can communicate within their own species (intra-species) but also between species (inter-species), for which they employ an autoinducer-2 quorum sensing system which is called the universal language of the bacteria. Periodontal pathogenic bacteria possess AI-2 quorum sensing systems. It is known that they use it for regulation of biofilm formation, iron uptake, stress response and virulence factor expression.

Here, we characterize the effect of wounding on the host-associated bacterial community of the bed bug. This is a model system where the male is wounding the female during every mating. Whereas several aspects of the microbial involvement during wounding have been previously examined, it is not clear to what extent QS and QSI play a role. We find that the microbiome differs depending on mating and feeding status of female bedbugs and is specific to the location of isolation. Most organs of bedbugs harbor bacteria, which are capable of both QS and QSI signaling. By focusing on the prokaryotic quorum communication system, we provide a baseline for future research in this unique system. We advocate the bedbug system as suitable for studying the effects of bacteria on reproduction and for addressing prokaryote and eukaryote communication during wounding."

Quorum sensing is the phenomenon, whereby bacteria use signal molecules to communicate with each other. For example, to establish a successful infection, pathogenic bacteria become virulent only when they reach a certain local concentration in their host. Bassler and others have highlighted the surprising observation that quorum sensing seems to repress Vibrio cholerae virulence factor expression (e.g. cholera toxin), in contrast to what has been observed for virulence gene expression in other bacteria. Here, I present a novel insight that may clarify the way V. cholerae quorum-sensing signals regulate its genes. Chironomids (Diptera; Chironomidae), which occur worldwide and are frequently the insect found most abundantly in fresh water bodies, are natural reservoirs of V. cholerae. Quorum-sensing signals in V. cholerae up-regulate the production of an extracellular enzyme, haemagglutinin protease (HAP), which degrades chironomid egg masses and prevents the eggs from hatching. HAP, therefore, is a virulence factor against chironomids. Indeed, in a survey carried out over the course of a year, V. cholerae and chironomids showed a pattern that mirrored the dynamics of predator-prey populations. Globally, the numbers of chironomids are much larger than those of humans, so quorum-sensing signals of V. cholerae and HAP gene regulation should be understood with regard to their role in chironomids rather than humans. Further research is needed to understand the role of cholera toxin in the environmental existence of V. cholerae."

Quorum sensing(QS) is one of the research hotspots in the fields of microbiology and medicine in recent years. Quorum sensing is a cell communication regulatory system, which is used by bacterial flora to pass on information of population density by sensing specific signaling molecules to the environment. The QS system of bacteria can impact biological functions, such as bacterial growth, proliferation, biofilm formation, virulence factor production, antibiotic synthesis, and ultimately adapt the bacteria to environmental changes. At present, more and more active ingredients can regulate quorum sensing have been found in traditional Chinese medicines(TCM). TCM and their active ingredients can promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, inhibit the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria and finally achieve the purpose of treating diseases. It embodies multi-pathway and multi-target characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine. This article first introduces molecular types and regulation mechanisms of quorum sensing signals between bacteria. On this basis, the human health-related bacterial quorum sensing is summarized, and the regulatory effect of TCM on bacterial quorum sensing system is discussed. Finally, it is noted that the material basis and mechanisms of TCM in improving human health through bacterial quorum sensing system are still unclear. Future research hotspots will focus on quorum sensing active substances, quorum sensing key nodes and relevant targets.

Quorum sensing is widely recognized as an efficient mechanism to regulate expression of specific genes responsible for communal behavior in bacteria. Several bacterial phenotypes essential for the successful establishment of symbiotic, pathogenic, or commensal relationships with eukaryotic hosts, including motility, exopolysaccharide production, biofilm formation, and toxin production, are often regulated by quorum sensing. Interestingly, eukaryotes produce quorum-sensing-interfering (QSI) compounds that have a positive or negative influence on the bacterial signaling network. This eukaryotic interference could result in further fine-tuning of bacterial quorum sensing. Furthermore, recent work involving the synthesis of structural homologs to the various quorum-sensing signal molecules has resulted in the development of additional QSI compounds that could be used to control pathogenic bacteria. The creation of transgenic plants that express bacterial quorum-sensing genes is yet another strategy to interfere with bacterial behavior. Further investigation on the manipulation of quorum-sensing systems could provide us with powerful tools against harmful bacteria."

METHODS This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, multiple-dose study in older adult men and women (aged \u2265 70 years, body mass index [BMI] 18-34 kg/m2) with stable health and diet. The study comprised seven treatment groups (Cohorts 1-7). Participants received bimagrumab or placebo treatment every 4 weeks for three doses (Cohorts 1 [700 mg] and 2 [210 mg] intravenous infusion; Cohorts 3 [1500 mg] and 4 [525 mg] subcutaneous infusion), or every week for 12 doses (Cohorts 5 [300 mg], 6 [150 mg], and 7 [52.5 mg] subcutaneous bolus injection) and were followed up until week 20. Blood samples were collected for bimagrumab PK analysis. PD were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry to quantify the change from baseline in lean body mass (LBM) and fat body mass (FBM) compared with placebo. Safety was assessed throughout the study. RESULTS Eighty-four of 91 (92.3%) randomized participants (mean age 74.5 years; BMI 28.0 kg/m2) completed the study. Demographic characteristics were generally balanced across the groups. A target-mediated drug disposition profile was observed following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The absolute subcutaneous bioavailability was estimated at approximately 40%. LBM increased by 4-6% (1.5-2 kg) from baseline throughout the treatment period for intravenous and subcutaneous regimens, except for the 52.5 mg subcutaneous dose, which did not differ from placebo. Concurrently, there was a decrease in FBM (approximately 2-3 kg) for all intravenous and subcutaneous regimens. Bimagrumab was generally safe and well tolerated; adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS Dose levels of bimagrumab administered weekly subcutaneously resulted in PK profiles and PD effects comparable with monthly intravenous dosing, which supports the feasibility of the subcutaneous route of administration for bimagrumab for future clinical development."

OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of bimagrumab on skeletal muscle mass and function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and reduced skeletal muscle mass. METHODS Sixty-seven patients with COPD (mean FEV1, 1.05 L [41.6% predicted]; aged 40-80 yr; body mass index < 20 kg/m2 or appendicular skeletal muscle mass index \u2264 7.25 [men] and \u2264 5.67 [women] kg/m2), received two doses of either bimagrumab 30 mg/kg intravenously (n = 33) or placebo (n = 34) (Weeks 0 and 8) over 24 weeks.

This study aimed to explore the clinical potential of bimagrumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the activin type II receptor, for the recovery of skeletal muscle volume from disuse atrophy using an experimental model of lower extremity immobilization. METHODS In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy young men (n = 24; mean age, 24.1 years) were placed in a full-length cast of one of the lower extremities for 2 weeks to induce disuse atrophy. After cast removal, subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of either bimagrumab 30 mg/kg (n = 15) or placebo (n = 9) and were followed for 12 weeks. Changes in thigh muscle volume (TMV) and inter-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) of the thigh, maximum voluntary knee extension strength, and safety were assessed throughout the 12 week study. RESULTS Casting resulted in an average TMV loss of -4.8% and comparable increases in IMAT and SCAT volumes. Bimagrumab 30 mg/kg i.v. resulted in a rapid increase in TMV at 2 weeks following cast removal and a +5.1% increase above pre-cast levels at 12 weeks. In comparison, TMV returned to pre-cast level at 12 weeks (-0.1%) in the placebo group. The increased adiposity of the casted leg was sustained in the placebo group and decreased substantially in the bimagrumab group at Week 12 (IMAT: -6.6%, SCAT: -3.5%). Knee extension strength decreased by ~25% in the casted leg for all subjects and returned to pre-cast levels within 6 weeks after cast removal in both treatment arms. Bimagrumab was well tolerated with no serious or severe adverse events reported during the study. CONCLUSIONS A single dose of bimagrumab 30 mg/kg i.v. safely accelerated the recovery of TMV and reversal of accumulated IMAT following 2 weeks in a joint-immobilizing cast."

We investigated whether such blockade of ActRII by bimagrumab manifests any detrimental effect on outcomes of bone healing in a rat fibula osteotomy model. Animals (n = 150) were divided into 11 groups and received weekly treatment with either bimagrumab (10 or 100 mg/kg) or vehicle. Progression and outcomes of bone healing were assessed by lateral radiographs in vivo as well as by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), 4-point bending test, and microscopic examination of the excised fibula at Day 29 or later. The radiographic progression of bone healing showed no significant differences between treatment groups in any comparative setting. In 3-month-old animals, pQCT revealed slightly reduced immature callus size and bone mineral content in bimagrumab-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated animals at Day 29 (p < 0.05). There were, however, no differences in mature callus size, bone mineral density, or biomechanical competency. The aforementioned effects on immature callus size were not present when the treatment was initiated 4 weeks post osteotomy or when treating 6-month-old animals. In summary, these findings suggest that there is no major impact of ActRII blockade on overall fracture healing, and delayed treatment initiation can bypass the small and transient effect of the therapy on immature callus formation observed in younger animals. Verification of these findings in humans is the subject of an ongoing clinical trial on elderly hip fracture patients."

Patients with a history of a high-energy subtrochanteric fracture or any other lower limb fracture in the past 6 months, or any major surgery of the lower limbs in the past 3 months were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1:2:2) via interactive response technology to receive intravenous treatment with placebo, bimagrumab 70 mg, bimagrumab 210 mg, or bimagrumab 700 mg every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. Participants, investigators, site personnel, and study sponsor personnel in participating countries were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in total lean body mass, measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, at week 24 in the full analysis set, which included all randomised participants who had received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. Key secondary endpoints included changes in habitual gait speed (measured in m/s) and short physical performance battery score between baseline and 24 weeks. Safety and tolerability were assessed by recording adverse events and vital signs on weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48, and by laboratory assessments and electrocardiography at the screening visit and on days 1, 84, and 168. Safety was assessed in all randomised participants who had received at least one dose of study drug, analysed according to treatment received. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02152761. FINDINGS Between Sept 16, 2014, and Dec 15, 2017, 384 patients were screened, of whom 250 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the placebo group (n=72), the bimagrumab 70 mg group (n=34), the bimagrumab 210 mg group (n=69), or the bimagrumab 700 mg group (n=75). A total of 207 (83%) participants completed the 24-week treatment period. There was a significant absolute increase in lean body mass from baseline compared with placebo (0\u00b72 kg [SD 2\u00b70]) in the bimagrumab 210 mg group (1\u00b79 kg [1\u00b77]; p<0\u00b70001) and in the bimagrumab 700 mg group 2\u00b78 kg [2\u00b72]; p<0\u00b70001) but not in the bimagrumab 70 mg group (0\u00b76 kg [SD 2\u00b72]; significance not assessed). Changes in habitual gait speed and short physical performance battery scores between baseline and week 24 were not significantly different across the treatment groups, suggesting no enhancement of physical recovery with bimagrumab over placebo. Bimagrumab was safe and well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were falls (six [18%] of 34 participants in the bimagrumab 70 mg group; 12 [17%] of 69 participants in the bimagrumab 210 mg group; 14 [19%] of 75 participants in the bimagrumab 700 mg group; and 13 [18%] of 72 participants in the placebo group), muscle spasms (two [6%] in the bimagrumab 70 mg group; 17 [25%] in the bimagrumab 210 mg group; 12 [16%] in the bimagrumab 700 mg group; and six [8%] in the placebo group), and arthralgia (five [15%] in the bimagrumab 70 mg group; six [9%] in the bimagrumab 210 mg group; nine [12%] in the bimagrumab 700 mg group; and five [7%] in the placebo group). Six deaths were reported during the study, none of which were considered by investigators as related to the study drug. INTERPRETATION Bimagrumab treatment for 24 weeks led to dose-dependent, significant increases in lean body mass in older patients recovering from hip fracture surgery when compared with placebo. However, no functional benefit was observed in recovery of mobility or lower extremity function following bimagrumab treatment compared with placebo. FUNDING Novartis Pharma."

OBJECTIVE To study activin signaling and its blockade in sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) through translational studies and a randomized controlled trial. METHODS We measured transforming growth factor \u03b2 signaling by SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in muscle biopsies of 50 patients with neuromuscular disease (17 with sIBM). We tested inhibition of activin receptors IIA and IIB (ActRII) in 14 patients with sIBM using one dose of bimagrumab (n = 11) or placebo (n = 3). The primary outcome was the change in right thigh muscle volume by MRI at 8 weeks. Lean body mass, strength, and function were secondary outcomes. Twelve of the patients (10 bimagrumab, 2 placebo) participated in a subsequent 16-week observation phase. RESULTS Muscle SMAD2/3 phosphorylation was higher in sIBM than in other muscle diseases studied (p = 0.003). Eight weeks after dosing, the bimagrumab-treated patients increased thigh muscle volume (right leg +6.5% compared with placebo, p = 0.024; left leg +7.6%, p = 0.009) and lean body mass (+5.7% compared with placebo, p = 0.014). Subsequently, bimagrumab-treated patients had improved 6-minute walking distance, which peaked at 16 weeks (+14.6%, p = 0.008) compared with placebo. There were no serious adverse events; the main adverse events with bimagrumab were mild acne and transient involuntary muscle contractions. CONCLUSIONS Transforming growth factor \u03b2 superfamily signaling, at least through ActRII, is implicated in the pathophysiology of sIBM. Inhibition of ActRII increased muscle mass and function in this pilot trial, offering a potential novel treatment of sIBM. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with inclusion body myositis, bimagrumab increases thigh muscle volume at 8 weeks."

BACKGROUND Sporadic inclusion body myositis is the most common inflammatory myopathy over the age of 50. The aetiopathogenesis of the disease remains unclear and to the day there is no effective treatment. OBJECTIVES The aim of the present review is to present the latest data on the new insights and developments in the treatment of sporadic inclusion body myositis, focusing on Bimagrumab and Alemtuzumab. METHODS For the purpose of the review we searched multiple internet databases in order to find the most recent studies and clinical trials on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Bimagrumab and Alemtuzumab in sporadic inclusion body myositis. RESULTS We found four trials on Bimagrumab, with one of them being an extension phase III study, and one small series trial on Alemtuzumab. The first clincopathological trial on Bimagrumab showed promising evidence, which were partially confirmed by the double-blinded controlled multicentre trial, however the primary endpoint of improving 6-m walking distance or improving the muscle strength has not been reached. The evidence from the Alemtuzumab trial was also promising, but the risk of bias of the study was relatively high, because it was open labelled, the number of patient was low and the yearly disease progression was much higher than in other recent studies. CONCLUSIONS Although both Bimagrumab and Alemtuzumab were well tolerated and showed promising results, the Bimagrumab trial did not reach the primary endpoint, and the Alemtuzumab trial has a relatively high risk of bias and the results need to be interpreted with caution."

Importance Antibody blockade of activin type II receptor (ActRII) signaling stimulates skeletal muscle growth. Previous clinical studies suggest that ActRII inhibition with the monoclonal antibody bimagrumab also promotes excess adipose tissue loss and improves insulin resistance. Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimagrumab on body composition and glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and overweight and obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants This double-masked, placebo-controlled, 48-week, phase 2 randomized clinical trial was conducted among adults with type 2 diabetes, body mass index between 28 and 40, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels between 6.5% and 10.0% at 9 US and UK sites. The trial was conducted from February 2017 to May 2019. Only participants who completed a full treatment regimen were included in analysis. Interventions Patients were randomized to intravenous infusion of bimagrumab (10 mg/kg up to 1200 mg in 5% dextrose solution) or placebo (5% dextrose solution) treatment every 4 weeks for 48 weeks; both groups received diet and exercise counseling. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was least square mean change from baseline to week 48 in total body fat mass (FM); secondary and exploratory end points were lean mass (LM), waist circumference (WC), HbA1c level, and body weight (BW) changes from baseline to week 48. Results A total of 75 patients were randomized to bimagrumab (n = 37; 23 [62.2%] women) or placebo (n = 38; 12 [31.6%] women); 58 (77.3%) completed the 48-week study. Patients at baseline had a mean (SD) age of 60.4 (7.7) years; mean (SD) BMI of 32.9 (3.4); mean (SD) BW of 93.6 (14.9) kg; mean (SD) FM of 35.4 (7.5) kg; and mean (SD) HbA1c level of 7.8% (1.0%). Changes at week 48 for bimagrumab vs placebo were as follows: FM, -20.5% (-7.5 kg [80% CI, -8.3 to -6.6 kg]) vs -0.5% (-0.18 kg [80% CI, -0.99 to 0.63 kg]) (P < .001); LM, 3.6% (1.70 kg [80% CI, 1.1 to 2.3 kg]) vs -0.8% (-0.4 kg [80% CI, -1.0 to 0.1 kg]) (P < .001); WC, -9.0 cm (80% CI, -10.3 to -7.7 cm) vs 0.5 cm (80% CI, -0.8 to 1.7 cm) (P < .001); HbA1c level, -0.76 percentage points (80% CI, -1.05 to -0.48 percentage points) vs -0.04 percentage points (80% CI, -0.23 to 0.31 percentage points) (P = .005); and BW, -6.5% (-5.9 kg [80% CI, -7.1 to -4.7 kg]) vs -0.8% (-0.8 kg [80% CI, -1.9 to 0.3 kg]) (P < .001). Bimagrumab's safety and tolerability profile was consistent with prior studies. Conclusions and Relevance In this phase 2 randomized clinical trial, ActRII blockade with bimagrumab led to significant loss of FM, gain in LM, and metabolic improvements during 48 weeks in patients with overweight or obesity who had type 2 diabetes. ActRII pathway inhibition may provide a novel approach for the pharmacologic management of excess adiposity and accompanying metabolic disturbances.

The administration of oxotremorine together with methylatropine to rats produces a dose-dependent increase of adrenal dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) activity. This effect is abolished by denervation of the gland and by cycloheximide. The Km for tyramine is not affected by the trans-synaptic induction of DBH by oxotremorine. The induction is selective, because similar treatment does not affect adrenal dopa decarboxylase or lactate dehydrogenase in the adrenal gland. The combination of 6-hydroxydopamine i.c.v. or propranolol i.p. does not alter the effect of oxotremorine on adrenal DBH. However, propranolol reduces the tremorigenic action of the muscarinic agonist. The systemic administration of p-chlorophenylalanine or the i.c.v. injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine before oxotremorine treatment does not affect the increase of adrenal DBH. Progabide, gamma-aminobutyric acid, a (GABA)A and GABAB receptor agonist that effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier, reduces the effect of oxotremorine in a dose-dependent manner. Muscimol given by either of two routes, i.c.v. at a constant rate (Alzet minipump) or i.p., produces significant decreases of adrenal DBH activity and attenuates the action of oxotremorine. Denervation of the gland abolishes the effect of muscimol i.p. in decreasing adrenal DBH activity. Baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, has no effect by itself or does it affect the action of oxotremorine. None of these GABA agonists has any in vitro effect on adrenal DBH activity. Bicuculline, GABAA receptor antagonist, reverses the action of progabide in oxotremorine-treated rats with respect to adrenal DBH activity, partially blocks the effect of muscimol and enhances the increase obtained with oxotremorine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Due to the rapid onset of resistance to most antibacterial drugs, research efforts are focusing on new classes of antibacterials with different mechanisms of action from clinically used antibacterials.

Two pleuromutilin derivatives, tiamulin and valnemulin have been successfully developed as antibiotics for veterinary use. Retapamulin, another pleuromutilin derivative has been approved for use in humans in April 2007 by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It has been shown that there is rarely cross-resistance between pleuromutilin derivatives and other antimicrobial agents, and the development of resistance bacterial is still low.

Retapamulin is the first agent in the new pleuromutilin class of antibacterials to become commercially available for clinical use in humans. Retapamulin acts as a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis and has a unique mode of antibiotic action. To date, retapamulin has not demonstrated any clinically relevant, target-specific crossresistance with other antibiotic classes, and has shown a low potential for resistance selection in vitro. In preclinical studies, retapamulin demonstrated pronounced in vitro activity against staphylococcal, streptococcal and anaerobic Gram-positive clinical isolates associated with skin and skin structure infections. Clinical pharmacology studies showed low systemic exposure with topical use of retapamulin, and a favorable tolerability profile. In clinical efficacy trials involving pediatric and adult patients who received retapamulin twice daily for five days, retapamulin was highly effective in the treatment of impetigo, secondarily infected traumatic lesions and secondarily infected dermatitis. Further, the clinical efficacy and safety profile of retapamulin was comparable to that of commonly used oral and topical antibiotics. Retapamulin was also clinically effective against isolates resistant to existing therapies. As a 1% ointment, retapamulin has been approved in the United States for the treatment of impetigo and in Europe for the shortterm treatment of impetigo and infected small lacerations, abrasions and sutured wounds."

In vitro studies show that retapamulin has high potency against the Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and coagulase-negative staphylococci) commonly found in skin and skin-structure infections (SSSIs), including S. aureus strains with resistance to agents such as macrolides, fusidic acid, or mupirocin, and other less common organisms associated with SSSIs, anaerobes, and common respiratory tract pathogens. Clinical studies have shown that twice-daily topical retapamulin for 5 days is comparable to 10 days of oral cephalexin in the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions. A 1% concentration of retapamulin ointment has been approved for clinical use as an easily applied treatment with a short, convenient dosing regimen for impetigo.

Retapamulin, a semisynthetic pleuromutilin derivative, is exclusively used for the topical short-term medication of impetigo and staphylococcal infections. In the present study, we report that retapamulin is adequately and rapidly metabolized in vitro via various metabolic pathways, such as hydroxylation, including mono-, di-, and trihydroxylation, and demethylation. Like tiamulin and valnemulin, the major metabolic routes of retapamulin were hydroxylation at the 2\u03b2 and 8\u03b1 positions of the mutilin moiety. Moreover, in vivo metabolism concurred with the results of the in vitro assays. Additionally, we observed significant interspecies differences in the metabolism of retapamulin. Until now, modifying the side chain was the mainstream method for new drug discovery of the pleuromutilins. This approach, however, could not resolve the low bioavailability and short efficacy of the drugs. Considering the rapid metabolism of the pleuromutilins mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, we propose that blocking the active metabolic site (C-2 and C-8 motif) or administering the drug in combination with cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors is a promising pathway in the development of novel pleuromutilin drugs with slow metabolism and long efficacy."

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has expanded rapidly worldwide. Now it has covered more than 150 countries worldwide. It is referred to as COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the respiratory systems of humans that can lead up to serious illness or even death in the presence of different comorbidities. However, most COVID-19 infected people show mild to moderate symptoms, and no medication is suggested. Still, drugs of other diseases have been used to treat COVID-19. Nevertheless, the absence of vaccines and proper drugs against the COVID-19 virus has increased the mortality rate. Albeit sex is a risk factor for COVID-19, none of the studies considered this risk factor for identifying biomarkers from the RNASeq count dataset. Men are more likely to undertake severe symptoms with different comorbidities and show greater mortality compared with women. From this standpoint, we aim to identify shared gene signatures between males and females from the human COVID-19 RNAseq count dataset of peripheral blood cells using a robust voom approach. We identified 1341 overlapping DEGs between male and female datasets. The gene ontology (GO) annotation and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs are involved in various BP categories such as nucleosome assembly, DNA conformation change, DNA packaging, and different KEGG pathways such as cell cycle, ECM-receptor interaction, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, etc. Ten hub-proteins (UBC, KIAA0101, APP, CDK1, SUMO2, SP1, FN1, CDK2, E2F1, and TP53) were unveiled using PPI network analysis. The top three miRNAs (mir-17-5p, mir-20a-5p, mir-93-5p) and TFs (PPARG, E2F1 and KLF5) were uncovered. In conclusion, the top ten significant drugs (roscovitine, curcumin, simvastatin, fulvestrant, troglitazone, alvocidib, L-alanine, tamoxifen, serine, and doxorubicin) were retrieved using drug repurposing analysis of overlapping DEGs, which might be therapeutic agents of COVID-19."

These proteoglycans are composed of a core protein to which extracellular glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are attached. Through these GAG chains, syndecans can interact with a variety of extracellular matrix molecules and bind to a number of soluble mediators including morphogens, growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. The structure and post-translational modification of syndecan GAG chains seem to differ not only from cell to cell, but also during different stages of cellular differentiation, leading to a complexity of syndecan function that is unique among membrane-bound HSPGs. Unlike other membrane-bound HSPGs, syndecans contain intracellular signalling motifs that can initiate signalling mainly through protein kinase C. This Review summarizes our knowledge of the biology of syndecans and the mechanisms by which binding of molecules to syndecans exert different biological effects, particularly in the joints. On the basis of the structural and functional peculiarities of syndecans, we discuss the regulation of syndecans and their roles in the developing joint as well as during degenerative and inflammatory cartilage remodelling as understood from expression studies and functional analyses involving syndecan-deficient mice."

Because intrinsically disordered proteins are incapable of forming unique tertiary structures in isolation, their interaction with partner structures enables them to play important roles in many different biological functions. Therefore, such proteins are usually multifunctional, and their ability to perform their major function, as well as accessory functions, depends on the characteristics of a given interaction. The present paper demonstrates, using predictions from two programs, that the transmembrane proteoglycans syndecans are natively disordered because of their diverse functions and large number of interaction partners. Syndecans perform multiple functions during development, damage repair, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis. By mediating the binding of a large number of extracellular ligands to their receptors, these proteoglycans trigger a cascade of reactions that subsequently regulate various cell processes: cytoskeleton formation, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration. The occurrences of 20 amino acids in syndecans 1-4 from 25 animals were compared with those in 17 animal proteomes. Gly + Ala, Thr, Glu, and Pro were observed to predominate in the syndecans, contributing to the lack of an ordered structure. In contrast, there were many fewer amino acids in syndecans that promote an ordered structure, such as Cys, Trp, Asn, and His. In addition, a region rich in Asp has been identified between two heparan sulfate-binding sites in the ectodomains, and a region rich in Lys has been identified in the conserved C1 site of the cytoplasmic domain. These particular regions play an essential role in the various functions of syndecans due to their lack of structure."

Syndecans regulate many cellular processes, such as adhesion, proliferation, and migration. Syndecans bind and regulate molecules primarily through their HS chains, but do not bind to all HS/heparin-binding molecules. Furthermore, mice ablated for the syndecan-1 or -4 gene do not show major developmental abnormalities, but they do show striking pathological phenotypes when challenged with infectious or inflammatory stimuli and conditions, suggesting that certain functions of syndecans are specific and cannot be compensated for by other syndecans or other HSPGs.

Syndecans play a major role in inflammation, mainly by regulating leukocyte extravasation and cytokine function. At the same time, syndecans can undergo cytokine mediated changes in their expression levels during inflammation. The function of syndecans during inflammation appears to depend on the stage of inflammation, sulfation of heparan/chondroitin sulfate chains, the rate of ectodomain shedding and the solubility of the ectodomains. From the current literature, it is clear that syndecans are not only involved in the initial recruitment of pro-inflammatory molecules but also in establishing a balanced progression of inflammation. This review will summarize how cell surface and soluble syndecans regulate multiple aspects of inflammation."

They are ubiquitous receptors on nearly all animal cell surfaces. In mammals, the cell surface proteoglycans include the six glypicans, CD44, NG2 (CSPG4), neuropilin-1 and four syndecans. A single syndecan is present in invertebrates such as nematodes and insects. Uniquely, syndecans are receptors for many classes of proteins that can bind to the heparan sulphate chains present on syndecan core proteins. These range from cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and morphogens to enzymes and extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins and collagens. Extracellular interactions with other receptors, such as some integrins, are mediated by the core protein. This places syndecans at the nexus of many cellular responses to extracellular cues in development, maintenance, repair and disease. The cytoplasmic domains of syndecans, while having no intrinsic kinase activity, can nevertheless signal through binding proteins. All syndecans appear to be connected to the actin cytoskeleton and can therefore contribute to cell adhesion, notably to the ECM and migration. Recent data now suggest that syndecans can regulate stretch-activated ion channels. The structure and function of the syndecans and the ion channels are reviewed here, along with an analysis of ion channel functions in cell-matrix adhesion. This area sheds new light on the syndecans, not least since evidence suggests that this is an evolutionarily conserved relationship that is also potentially important in the progression of some common diseases where syndecans are implicated."

Syndecans are transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, neuronal development, and lipid metabolism. Syndecans are expressed in a tissue-specific manner to facilitate diverse cellular processes. As receptors and co-receptors, syndecans provide promising therapeutic targets that bind to a variety of physiologically important ligands. Negatively charged glycosaminoglycan chains of syndecans, located in the extracellular compartment, are critical for such binding. Functions of syndecans are as diverse as their ligands. For example, hepatic syndecan-1 mediates clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Syndecan-2 promotes localization of Alzheimer's amyloid A\u03b2 peptide to the cell surface, which is proposed to contribute to amyloid plaque formation. Syndecan-3 helps co-localize the appetite-regulating melanocortin-4 receptor with its agonist, leading to an increased appetite. Finally, syndecan-4 initiates the capture of modified low-density lipoproteins by macrophages and thereby promotes the atheroma formation. We hypothesize that syndecan modifications such as desulfation of glycosaminoglycan chains may contribute to a wide range of diseases, from atherosclerosis to type 2 diabetes. At the same time, desulfated syndecans may have beneficial effects, as they can inhibit amyloid plaque formation or decrease the appetite. Despite considerable progress in understanding diverse functions of syndecans, the complex physiological roles of this intriguing family of proteoglycans are far from clear. Additional studies of syndecans may potentially help develop novel therapeutic approaches and diagnostic tools to alleviate complex human diseases such as cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases."

Bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells down-regulate the activation status of the unfolded protein response, and up-regulate \u03b22 proteasome activity.

LU-102 inhibited the \u03b22 activity in intact myeloma cells at low micromolar concentrations without relevant co-inhibition of \u03b21 and \u03b25 proteasome subunits. In proteasome inhibitor-resistant myeloma cells, significantly more potent proteasome inhibition was achieved by bortezomib or carfilzomib in combination with LU-102, compared to bortezomib/carfilzomib alone, resulting in highly synergistic cytotoxic activity of the drug combination via endoplasmatic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis.

With other patients presenting with disease that is intrinsically bortezomib resistant, it is clear that new therapeutic approaches are desperately required to target bortezomib-resistant myeloma. We have previously shown that targeting sphingolipid metabolism with the sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) inhibitor K145 in combination with bortezomib induces synergistic death of bortezomib-na\u00efve myeloma. In the current study, we have demonstrated that targeting sphingolipid metabolism with K145 synergises with bortezomib and effectively resensitises bortezomib-resistant myeloma to this proteasome inhibitor. Notably, these effects were dependent on enhanced activation of the unfolded protein response, and were observed in numerous separate myeloma models that appear to have different mechanisms of bortezomib resistance, including a new bortezomib-resistant myeloma model we describe which possesses a clinically relevant proteasome mutation. Furthermore, K145 also displayed synergy with the next-generation proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in bortezomib-resistant and carfilzomib-resistant myeloma cells.

We have recently demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors can be effective in inducing apoptotic cell death in endometrial carcinoma cell lines and primary culture explants. Increasing evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species are responsible for proteasome inhibitor-induced cell killing. Antioxidants can thus block apoptosis (cell death) triggered by proteasome inhibition. Here, we have evaluated the effects of different antioxidants (edaravone and tiron) on endometrial carcinoma cells treated with aldehyde proteasome inhibitors (MG-132 or ALLN), the boronic acid-based proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) and the epoxyketone, epoxomicin. We show that tiron specifically inhibited the cytotoxic effects of bortezomib, whereas edaravone inhibited cell death caused by aldehyde-based proteasome inhibitors. We have, however, found that edaravone completely inhibited accumulation of ubiquitin and proteasome activity decrease caused by MG-132 or ALLN, but not by bortezomib. Conversely, tiron inhibited the ubiquitin accumulation and proteasome activity decrease caused by bortezomib. These results suggest that edaravone and tiron rescue cells of proteasome inhibitors from cell death, by inhibiting blockade of proteasome caused by MG-132 and ALLN or bortezomib, respectively. We also tested other antioxidants, and we found that vitamin C inhibited bortezomib-induced cell death. Similar to tiron, vitamin C inhibited cell death by blocking the ability of bortezomib to inhibit the proteasome.

Bortezomib-resistant myeloma models were used to examine the correlation between POMP expression and bortezomib sensitivity. POMP expression was then modulated using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to determine the effects on proteasome inhibitor sensitivity in cell lines and in vivo models. Resistant cell lines were found to overexpress POMP, and while its suppression in cell lines enhanced bortezomib sensitivity, POMP overexpression in drug-naive cells conferred resistance. Overexpression of POMP was associated with increased levels of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like (NRF2), and NRF2 was found to bind to and activate the POMP promoter. Knockdown of NRF2 in bortezomib-resistant cells reduced POMP levels and proteasome activity, whereas its overexpression in drug-naive cells increased POMP and proteasome activity. The NRF2 inhibitor all-trans-retinoic acid reduced cellular NRF2 levels and increased the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities of bortezomib in resistant cells, while decreasing proteasome capacity. Finally, the combination of all-trans-retinoic acid with bortezomib showed enhanced activity against primary patient samples and in a murine model of bortezomib-resistant myeloma.

Various NSCLC cell lines displayed differential intrinsic sensitivities to bortezomib. High basal chymotrypsin- and caspase-like proteasome activities correlated with bortezomib resistance in these cells.

Bortezomib elevated the amount of glutathione (GSH) and the treatment with bortezomib increased the level of mRNA for GCL, a rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. Furthermore, depletion of GSH increases apoptosis induced by bortezomib, in contrast, repletion of GSH decreases bortezomib-mediated cell death. CONCLUSION GSH protects cells from proteasome inhibition-induced oxidative stress and glutathione-dependent redox system might play an important role in the sensitivity to proteasome inhibition-induced apoptosis."

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a severe lipid storage disorder caused by the diminished activity of the acid sphingomyelinase enzyme. ASMD is characterized by the accumulation of sphingomyelin in late endosomes and lysosomes leading to progressive neurological dysfunction and hepatosplenomegaly. Our objective was to investigate the utility of synthetic apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) mimetics designed to act as lipid scavengers for the treatment of ASMD. We determined the lead peptide, 22A, could reduce sphingomyelin accumulation in ASMD patient skin fibroblasts in a dose dependent manner. Intraperitoneal administration of 22A formulated as a synthetic high-density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanodisc mobilized sphingomyelin from peripheral tissues into circulation and improved liver function in a mouse model of ASMD. Together, our data demonstrates that apolipoprotein mimetics could serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for modulating the pathology observed in ASMD."

BACKGROUND Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a lysosomal disorder caused by deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) leading to the accumulation of sphingomyelin (SM) in a variety of cell types. Lysosphingomyelin (LysoSM) is the de-acetylated form of SM and it has been shown as a biomarker for ASMD in tissues, plasma, and dried blood spots (DBS) and lysosphingomyelin-509 (LysoSM509) is the carboxylated analogue of LysoSM. High levels of Lysosphingomyelin 509 (LysoSM509) have also been shown in ASMD patients. In this study, we report the utility of the quantification of LysoSM and LysoSM509 in DBS of patients from Latin America with ASMD by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). RESULTS DBS samples from 14 ASMD patients were compared with 15 controls, and 44 general newborns. All patients had their diagnosis confirmed by the quantification of ASM and the measurement of the activity of chitotriosidase. All patients had significantly higher levels of lysoSM and lysoSM509 compared to controls and general newborns. CONCLUSIONS The quantification of lysosphingolipids in DBS is a valuable tool for the diagnosis of ASMD patients and lysoSM can be useful in the differential diagnosis with NPC. This method is also valuable in the ASMD newborn screening process."

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficient activity of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) enzyme, leading to the accumulation of varying degrees of sphingomyelin. Lipid storage leads to foam cell infiltration in tissues, and clinical features including hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary insufficiency and in some cases central nervous system involvement. ASM enzyme replacement therapy is currently in clinical trial being the first treatment addressing the underlying pathology of the disease. Therefore, presently, it is critical to better comprehend ASMD to improve its diagnose and monitoring. Lung disease, including recurrent pulmonary infections, are common in ASMD patients. Along with lung disease, several immune system alterations have been described both in patients and in ASMD animal models, thus highlighting the role of ASM enzyme in the immune system. In this review, we summarized the pivotal roles of ASM in several immune system cells namely on macrophages, Natural Killer (NK) cells, NKT cells, B cells and T cells. In addition, an overview of diagnose, monitoring and treatment of ASMD is provided highlighting the new enzyme replacement therapy available."

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gene-encoding acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). ASMD impacts peripheral organs in all patients, including the liver and spleen. The infantile and chronic neurovisceral forms of the disease also lead to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration for which there is no effective treatment. Cellular accumulation of sphingomyelin (SM) is a pathological hallmark in all tissues. SM is the only sphingolipid comprised of a phosphocholine group linked to ceramide. Choline is an essential nutrient that must be obtained from the diet and its deficiency promotes fatty liver disease in a process dependent on ASM activity. We thus hypothesized that choline deprivation could reduce SM production and have beneficial effects in ASMD. Using acid sphingomyelinase knock-out (ASMko) mice, which mimic neurovisceral ASMD, we have assessed the safety of a choline-free diet and its effects on liver and brain pathological features such as altered sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid composition, inflammation and neurodegeneration. We found that the choline-free diet was safe in our experimental conditions and reduced activation of macrophages and microglia in the liver and brain, respectively. However, there was no significant impact on sphingolipid levels and neurodegeneration was not prevented, arguing against the potential of this nutritional strategy to assist in the management of neurovisceral ASMD patients."

The clinical manifestation of sphingolipidosis leads often to misclassification between acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) and Gaucher disease. In this multicenter, prospective study, we investigated a cohort of 31,838 individuals suspected to have Gaucher disease, due to clinical presentation, from 61 countries between 2017 and 2022. For all samples, both Acid-\u03b2-glucocerebrosidase and acid sphingomyelinase enzyme activities were measured in dried blood spot specimens by tandem mass spectrometry followed by genetic confirmatory testing in potential positive cases. In total, 5933 symptomatic cases showed decreased enzyme activities and were submitted for genetic confirmatory testing. 1411/5933 (24%) cases were finally identified with Gaucher disease and 550/5933 (9%) with ASMD. Most of the confirmed ASMD cases were newborns and children below 2 years of age (63%). This study reveals that one in four cases suspected for Gaucher disease is diagnosed with ASMD. An early appropriate diagnostic work-up is essential because of the availability of a recently approved enzyme replacement therapy for ASMD. In conclusion, a diagnostic strategy using differential biochemical testing including genetic confirmatory testing in clinically suspected cases for sphingolipidosis is highly recommended."

Lysosomal storage disorders are a group of inborn errors of metabolism due to defects in proteins crucial for lysosomal function. Gaucher disease is the most common autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to mutations in the GBA1 gene, resulting in the lysosomal deficiency of glucocerebrosidase activity. Gaucher disease is characterized by the toxic accumulation of glucosylceramide in the reticuloendothelial system. Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), previously known as Niemann Pick A/B disease, is also an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to mutations in the SMPD1 gene, which result in acid sphingomyelinase deficiency and the accumulation of sphingomyelin in mononuclear phagocytic system and hepatocytes. The phenotypic expression of Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1), the most common type, and chronic visceral ASMD may overlap for several signs or symptoms. Splenomegaly is detectable in approximately 90% of the patients in both conditions; however, since GD1 is more frequent than ASMD, clinicians are more prone to suspect it, often neglecting the diagnosis of ASMD. Based on previous experience, a group of experts in the clinical and laboratory diagnosis, management, and treatment of lysosomal storage disorders developed an algorithm for both GD1 and ASMD to support physicians, including primary care providers, internists, and specialists (e.g., hepatologists, hematologists, and pulmonologists) to suspect and differentiate GD1 and ASMD and to provide the appropriate referral."

It is the first and currently the only disease-modifying treatment for ASMD. Olipudase alfa treatment improves hepatosplenomegaly, lung function and platelet counts, along with multiple other pathological features of ASMD in adult and paediatric patients with ASMD. These benefits are sustained through at least 24 months of treatment. Olipudase alfa is generally well tolerated; infusion-associated reactions (mostly mild) were the most common treatment-related adverse events. Other warnings and precautions associated with its use include risks of hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and elevated transaminase levels seen in clinical trials, and foetal malformation based on animal studies. All these risks are generally manageable.

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a rare inherited lipid storage disorder caused by a deficiency in lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase which results in the accumulation of sphingomyelin, predominantly within cells of the reticuloendothelial system located in numerous organs, such as the liver, spleen, lungs, and central nervous system. Although all patients with ASMD share the same basic metabolic defect, a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes are observed, contributing to treatment challenges. While infantile neurovisceral ASMD (also known as Niemann-Pick disease type A) is rapidly progressive and fatal in early childhood, and the more slowly progressive chronic neurovisceral (type A/B) and chronic visceral (type B) forms have varying clinical phenotypes and life expectancy. The prognosis of visceral ASMD is mainly determined by the association of hepatosplenomegaly with secondary thrombocytopenia and lung disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to reduce the risk of complications and mortality. The accessibility of the new enzyme replacement therapy olipudase alfa, a recombinant human ASM, has been expedited for clinical use based on positive clinical data in children and adult patients, such as improved respiratory status and reduced spleen volume. The aim of this article is to share the authors experience on monitoring ASMD patients and stratifying the severity of the disease to aid in care decisions."

The recent introduction of asciminib may be a promising option in intolerant patients, as it is a first-in-class inhibitor with a more selective mechanism of action different from the ATP-competitive inhibition that occurs with TKIs. Therefore, our goal was to analyze toxicities shown with asciminib as well as to study cross-toxicity with previous TKIs. (2) Methods: An observational, multicenter, retrospective study was performed with data from 77 patients with CML with therapeutic failure to second-generation TKIs who received asciminib through a managed-access program (MAP) (3) Results: With a median follow-up of 13.7 months, 22 patients (28.5%) discontinued treatment: 32% (7/22) due to intolerance and 45% (10/22) due to resistance. Fifty-five percent of the patients reported adverse effects (AEs) with asciminib and eighteen percent grade 3-4. Most frequent AEs were: fatigue (18%), thrombocytopenia (17%), anemia (12%), and arthralgias (12%). None of the patients experienced cardiovascular events or occlusive arterial disease. Further, 26%, 25%, and 9% of patients required dose adjustment, temporary suspension, or definitive discontinuation of treatment, respectively. Toxicities under asciminib seemed lower than with prior TKIs for anemia, cardiovascular events, pleural/pericardial effusion, diarrhea, and edema. Cross-toxicity risk was statistically significant for thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, fatigue, vomiting, and pancreatitis. (4) Conclusion: Asciminib is a molecule with a good safety profile and with a low rate of AEs.

Asciminib, a highly selective non-ATP competitive inhibitor of BCR-ABL, has demonstrated to be a promising drug for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. It is a pity that two resistant mutations (I502L and V468F) have been found during the clinical trial, which is a challenge for the curative effect of Asciminib. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GB/SA) calculations were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism of Asciminib resistance induced by the two mutants. The obtained results indicate that the mutations have adversely influence on the binding of Asciminib to BCR-ABL, as the nonpolar contributions decline in the two mutants. In addition, I502L mutation causes \u03b1-helix I' (\u03b1I') to shift away from the helical bundle composed of \u03b1E, \u03b1F, and \u03b1H, making the distance between \u03b1I' and Asciminib increased.

PURPOSE To review the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, dosing and administration, and place in therapy of asciminib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used as a third-line treatment option for Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. SUMMARY CML is a rare cancer caused by a chromosomal translocation that forms a fusion of the BCR and ABL1 genes on chromosomes 22 and 9. Until recently, patients for whom first-line treatment options failed were treated with TKIs that bind to the adenosine triphosphate-binding site on BCR-ABL1. However, because of similar mechanisms of action, there continues to be an unmet need in patients for whom at least 2 TKIs have failed or those with a T315I mutation unable to tolerate ponatinib. In October 2021, the Food and Drug Administration approved asciminib (Scemblix), the first TKI specifically targeting the ABL1 myristoyl pocket (STAMP) via allosteric binding, as a third-line option for patients with chronic-phase (CP)-CML. Asciminib received accelerated approval due to meeting its primary endpoint at week 24, demonstrating a major molecular response rate of 25.5% for patients on asciminib compared to 13.2% for those receiving bosutinib. In addition, patients on asciminib achieved a higher rate of complete cytogenetic response at 40.8% compared to a rate of 24.2% for bosutinib. Clinicians prescribing asciminib should monitor for increased levels of pancreatic enzymes, hypertension, cardiovascular toxicity including ischemic and thromboembolic conditions, and decreased numbers of neutrophils and platelets, as these may require treatment interruption, dose reduction, or treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSION Asciminib is a unique targeted TKI that provides clinicians with an additional third-line and beyond treatment option for adults with CP-CML regardless of mutation status as well as a second TKI treatment option for patients harboring a T315I mutation."

Asciminib sensitivity was evaluated in asciminib na\u00efve BCR-ABL1+ cell lines K562 (negligible ABCB1/ABCG2 expression), K562-Dox (ABCB1-overexpressing through doxorubicin exposure) and K562-ABCG2 (ABCG2 overexpression via transduction) with results demonstrating asciminib efflux by both ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters. K562-Dox and K562-ABCG2 cells demonstrated increased LD50asciminib vs K562 control cells: 256 and 299 nM respectively vs 24 nM, p < 0.001. Sensitivity was completely restored with specific inhibitors cyclosporine (ABCB1) and Ko143 (ABCG2): K562-Dox LD50asciminib+cyclosporine = 13 nM, K562-ABCG2 LD50asciminib+Ko143 = 15 nM (p < 0.001). When asciminib resistance was modelled in vitro, ABCB1 and ABCG2 overexpression was integral in the development of asciminib resistance. In K562 asciminib-resistant cells, ABCG2 expression increased prior to BCR-ABL1 overexpression and remained high (up to 7.6-fold greater levels in resistant vs control cells, p < 0.001). K562-Dox asciminib-resistant cells had increased ABCB1 expression (2.1-fold vs control cells p = 0.0033). KU812 asciminib-resistant cells overexpressed ABCB1 (5.4-fold increase, p < 0.001) and ABCG2 (6-fold increase, p < 0.001) before emergence of a novel myristate-binding pocket mutation (F497L). In all three cell lines, asciminib resistance was reversible upon chemical inhibition of ABCB1, ABCG2 or both (p < 0.001). When K562 asciminib-resistant cells were treated with asciminib in combination with clinically achievable doses of either imatinib or nilotinib, reversal of the resistance phenotype was also observed (p < 0.01). Overexpression of efflux transporters will likely be an important pathway for asciminib resistance in the clinical setting. Given the lack of evidence for ABCG2-mediated transport of nilotinib or imatinib at clinically relevant concentrations, our data provide an additional rationale for using asciminib in combination with either TKI."

BACKGROUND Chronic myeloid leukaemia is in principle a treatable malignancy but drug resistance is lowering survival. Recent drug discoveries have opened up new options for drug combinations, which is a concept used in other areas for preventing drug resistance. Two of these are (I) Axitinib, which inhibits the T315I mutation of BCR-ABL1, a main source of drug resistance, and (II) Asciminib, which has been developed as an allosteric BCR-ABL1 inhibitor, targeting an entirely different binding site, and as such does not compete for binding with other drugs. These drugs offer new treatment options. METHODS We measured the proliferation of KCL-22 cells exposed to imatinib-dasatinib, imatinib-asciminib and dasatinib-asciminib combinations and calculated combination index graphs for each case. Moreover, using the median-effect equation we calculated how much axitinib can reduce the growth advantage of T315I mutant clones in combination with available drugs. In addition, we calculated how much the total drug burden could be reduced by combinations using asciminib and other drugs, and evaluated which mutations such combinations might be sensitive to. RESULTS Asciminib had synergistic interactions with imatinib or dasatinib in KCL-22 cells at high degrees of inhibition. Interestingly, some antagonism between asciminib and the other drugs was present at lower degrees on inhibition. Simulations revealed that asciminib may allow for dose reductions, and its complementary resistance profile could reduce the risk of mutation based resistance. Axitinib, however, had only a minor effect on T315I growth advantage. CONCLUSIONS Given how asciminib combinations were synergistic in vitro, our modelling suggests that drug combinations involving asciminib should allow for lower total drug doses, and may result in a reduced spectrum of observed resistance mutations. On the other hand, a combination involving axitinib was not shown to be useful in countering drug resistance."

Inhibitors that bind competitively to the ATP binding pocket in the kinase domain of the oncogenic fusion protein BCR-Abl1 are used successfully in targeted therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Such inhibitors provided the first proof of concept that kinase inhibition can succeed in a clinical setting. However, emergence of drug resistance and dose-dependent toxicities limit the effectiveness of these drugs. Therefore, treatment with a combination of drugs without overlapping resistance mechanisms appears to be an appropriate strategy. In the present work, we explore the effectiveness of combination therapies of the recently developed allosteric inhibitor asciminib with the ATP-competitive inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib in inhibiting the BCR-Abl1 kinase activity in CML cell lines. Through these experiments, we demonstrate that asciminib significantly enhances the inhibition activity of nilotinib, but not of dasatinib. Exploring molecular mechanisms for such allosteric enhancement via systematic computational investigation incorporating molecular dynamics, metadynamics simulations, and density functional theory calculations, we found two distinct contributions. First, binding of asciminib triggers conformational changes in the inactive state of the protein, thereby making the activation process less favorable by \u223c4 kcal/mol. Second, the binding of asciminib decreases the binding free energies of nilotinib by \u223c3 and \u223c7 kcal/mol for the wildtype and T315I-mutated protein, respectively, suggesting the possibility of reducing nilotinib dosage and lowering risk of developing resistance in the treatment of CML."

Asciminib is an allosteric high-affinity tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of the BCR-ABL1 protein kinase. This kinase is translated from the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Marketing authorization for asciminib was granted on August 25, 2022 by the European Commission. The approved indication was for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in the chronic phase which have previously been treated with at least 2 TKIs. Clinical efficacy and safety of asciminib were evaluated in the open-label, randomized, phase III ASCEMBL study. The primary endpoint of this trial was major molecular response (MMR) rate at 24 weeks. A significant difference in MRR rate was shown between the asciminib treated population and the bosutinib control group (25.5% vs. 13.2%, respectively, P = .029). In the asciminib cohort, adverse reactions of at least grade 3 with an incidence \u2265 5% were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, increased pancreatic enzymes, hypertension, and anemia. The aim of this article is to summarize the scientific review of the application which led to the positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use."

However, it is unclear exactly where asciminib will be positioned amongst the other available tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), especially ponatinib which is also available for the same indications. There are many questions yet to be answered with regard to the optimal use of asciminib which include its role in the first- and second-line settings, combination therapy with other TKIs, and effectiveness in advanced phase CML. In this review, we discuss the available data on asciminib while exploring a number of clinical trials in progress. Finally, we provide our opinion based on the current data about where asciminib is most likely to be the optimal choice, which will hopefully assist clinicians with therapy selection."

Such regions confer a high propensity for stable base unpairing. Using an in vivo cross-linking strategy, specialized genomic sequences (0.1-1. 1 kbp) that bind to SATB1 in human lymphoblastic cell line Jurkat cells were individually isolated and characterized. All in vivo SATB1-binding sequences examined contained typical ATC sequence contexts, with some exhibiting homology to autonomously replicating sequences from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that function as replication origins in yeast cells. In addition, LINE 1 elements, satellite 2 sequences, and CpG island-containing DNA were identified. To examine the higher-order packaging of these in vivo SATB1-binding sequences, high-resolution in situ fluorescence hybridization was performed with both nuclear \"halos\" with distended loops and the nuclear matrix after the majority of DNA had been removed by nuclease digestion. In vivo SATB1-binding sequences hybridized to genomic DNA as single spots within the residual nucleus circumscribed by the halo of DNA and remained as single spots in the nuclear matrix, indicating that these sequences are localized at the base of chromatin loops. In human breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells that do not express SATB1, at least one such sequence was found not anchored onto the nuclear matrix. These findings provide the first evidence that a cell type-specific factor such as SATB1 binds to the base of chromatin loops in vivo and suggests that a specific chromatin loop domain structure is involved in T cell-specific gene regulation."

Missing nucleoside experiments showed that SATB1 selectively binds in a special AT-rich sequence context where one strand consists of mixed A's, T's, and C's, excluding G's (ATC sequences). When this feature is destroyed by mutation, SATB1 binding is greatly reduced even if the direct contact sequence remains intact. Conjunctional SATB1-binding sequences become stably unpaired in supercoiled DNA. Specific mutations that diminish the unwinding potential greatly reduce SATB1 binding. However, SATB1 does not bind single-stranded DNA. Chemical interference assays show that SATB1 binds along the minor groove with very little contact with the bases.

Interestingly, 70% of the t(14,18) translocations are confined to three 15-bp clusters positioned within a 150-bp region (major breakpoint region or [MBR]) in the untranslated portion of terminal exon 3. We analyzed DNA-protein interactions in the MBR, as these may play some role in targeting the translocation to this region. An 87-bp segment (87MBR) immediately 3' to breakpoint cluster 3 was essential for DNA-protein interaction monitored with mobility shift assays. We further delineated a core binding region within 87MBR: a 33-bp, very AT-rich sequence highly conserved between the human and mouse BCL2 gene (37MBR). We have purified and identified one of the core factors as the matrix attachment region (MAR) binding protein, SATB1, which is known to bind to AT-rich sequences with a high propensity to unwind. Additional factors in nuclear extracts, which we have not yet characterized further, increased SATB1 affinity for the 37MBR target four- to fivefold. Specific binding activity within 37MBR displayed cell cycle regulation in Jurkat T cells, while levels of SATB1 remained constant throughout the cell cycle.

Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a tissue-restricted genome organizer that provides a key link between DNA loop organization, chromatin modification/remodeling, and transcription factor association at matrix attachment regions (MARs). The SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 enhances SUMO conjugation to SATB1 lysine-744, and this modification regulates caspase-6 mediated cleavage of SATB1 at promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs). Since this regulated caspase cleavage occurs on only a subset of SATB1, and the products are relatively stable, proteolysis likely mediates cellular processes other than programmed cell death. However, the mechanism for the spatial and temporal regulation of SATB1 sumoylation and caspase cleavage is not known. Here we report that these processes are controlled by SATB1 phosphorylation; specifically, PIAS1 interaction with SATB1 is inhibited by phosphorylation. Mutagenesis studies identified interaction of the PIAS SAP (scaffold attachment factor-A/B/acinus/PIAS) motif with SATB1 N-terminal sequences. Notably, phosphorylation of SATB1 at threonine-188 regulates its interaction with PIAS1. Sequences near this phosphorylation site, LXXLL (residues 193 to 197), appear to be conserved among a subset of SUMO substrate proteins. Thus, this motif may be commonly involved in interaction with the PIAS SAP, and phosphorylation may similarly inhibit some of these substrates by preventing their interaction with the ligase."

Surprisingly, this domain resembles a ubiquitin domain instead of the previously proposed PDZ domain. Our results also reveal that SATB1 can form a tetramer through its N-terminal domain. The tetramerization of SATB1 plays an essential role in its binding to highly specialized DNA sequences. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry results indicate that the SATB1 tetramer can bind simultaneously to two DNA targets.

SATB1 is a homeodomain protein and is predominantly expressed in thymocytes. We obtained BHK cell lines expressing low levels of SATB1 by stable transfection and investigated its effect on stably integrated MAR-linked SV40 enhancer/promoter-driven luciferase reporter genes. For this study, both naturally occurring and synthetic MARs, as well as an AT-rich non-MAR control, were tested. Previous studies demonstrated that MAR sequences augment transcription of the linked reporter luciferase gene. Here, we show that SATB1 dramatically reduces the high levels of MAR-linked luciferase gene transcription. Transcription was virtually abolished for a reporter gene surrounded by two MARs at the 5' and 3' ends of the gene, which otherwise confer the highest level of transcriptional augmentation. On the other hand, SATB1 did not affect expression of an AT-rich non-MAR-linked luciferase gene or of endogenous housekeeping genes.

This mouse cDNA encodes a 764-amino-acid protein with a 98% homology in amino acid sequence to the human SATB1 originally cloned from testis. To characterize the DNA binding domain of this novel class of protein, we used the mouse SATB1 cDNA and delineated a 150-amino-acid polypeptide as the binding domain. This region confers full DNA binding activity, recognizes the specific sequence context, and makes direct contact with DNA at the same nucleotides as the whole protein. This DNA binding domain contains a novel DNA binding motif: when no more than 21 amino acids at either the N- or C-terminal end of the binding domain are deleted, the majority of the DNA binding activity is lost. The concomitant presence of both terminal sequences is mandatory for binding. These two terminal regions consist of hydrophilic amino acids and share homologous sequences that are different from those of any known DNA binding motifs.

BACKGROUND Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a chromatin-remodeling protein that regulates gene expressions in different types of cancer. Up-regulation of SATB1 is linked with progression of tumors. Our previous study showed that SATB1 expression was decreased in T cell leukemia/lymphoma. The contrary roles of SATB1 in solid organ tumors and hematology malignancy may provide hints to study the function of SATB1. METHODS To characterize SATB1 mRNA and protein expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we performed qRT-PCR and Western blot on bone marrow mononuclear cells from 52 newly diagnosed AML patients. Stable HL-60 cell lines with knockdown of SATB1 by shRNAs sequences (HL-60 SATB1-shRNA1 and HL-60 SATB1-shRNA2) were established. Cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell invasiveness were analyzed. Murine model was established using HL-60 SATB1-shRNAs treated nude mice and tumorigenicity was compared to study the role of SATB1 in vivo. Global gene expression profiles were analyzed in HL-60 cells with SATB1 knockdown to investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of AML cell growth by SATB1. RESULTS We found that SATB1 expression was significantly decreased in patients with AML compared to normal control, and was increased after complete remission of AML. Knockdown of SATB1 enhanced the proliferation of HL-60 cells and accelerated S phase entry in vitro, and promoted the tumor growth in vivo. Global gene expression profiles were analyzed in HL-60 cells with SATB1 knockdown and the differentially expressed genes were involved in NF-\u03baB, MAPK and PI3 K/Akt signaling pathways. Nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 levels were significantly increased in SATB1 depleted HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS Decreased SATB1 expression promotes AML cell proliferation through NF-\u03baB activation.

To better understand DNA recognition and transcription activity by SATB1, the T-lineage-enriched chromatin organizer and transcription factor, we have determined its optimal DNA-binding sequence by random oligonucleotide selection. The consensus SATB1-binding sequence (CSBS) comprises a palindromic sequence in which two identical AT-rich half-sites are arranged as inverted repeats flanking a central cytosine or guanine. Strikingly, the CSBS half-site is identical to the conserved element 'TAATA' bound by the known homeodomains (HDs). Furthermore, we show that the high-affinity binding of SATB1 to DNA is dimerization-dependent and the HD also binds in similar fashion. Binding studies using HD-lacking SATB1 and binding target with increased spacer between the two half-sites led us to propose a model for SATB1-DNA complex in which the HDs bind in an antiparallel fashion to the palindromic consensus element via minor groove, bridged by the PDZ-like dimerization domain. CSBS-driven in vivo reporter analysis indicated that SATB1 acts as a repressor upon binding to the CSBS and most of its derivatives and the extent of repression is proportional to SATB1's binding affinity to these sequences.

Meanwhile, Akt phosphorylates Oct4 at threonine 228 and Klf4 at threonine 399, and accelerates their degradation. Moreover, PI3K/Akt signaling enhances the binding of SATB1 to Sox2, thereby probably impairing the formation of Oct4/Sox2 regulatory complexes. During retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs), the Akt activation profile as well as its substrate spectrum is strikingly correlated with the down-regulation of Oct4, Klf4 and Nanog, which suggests Akt activation is coupled to the onset of differentiation. Accordingly, Akt-mediated phosphorylation is crucial for the capability of SATB1 to repress Nanog expression and to activate transcription of Bcl2 and Nestin genes.

Although admixture cannot be completely discounted, it was possible to exclude migration and new mutation as major sources of changes in the frequency of these alleles by limiting analyses to pedigrees descendant from founding families. Calculations which overestimated the possible effect of random drift demonstrated that drift did not account for the observed changes in gene frequencies. Therefore these changes must have been caused by natural selection, and a coefficient of selection was estimated for each trait. For the rare, dominant, deleterious allele associated with Huntington disease, the coefficient of selection was estimated to be .34, indicating that this allele has a selective disadvantage, contrary to some recent studies. For the presumed dominant and probably deleterious allele associated with porphyria variegata, the coefficient of selection lies between .07 and .02.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings include progressive frontal cortical atrophy and bilateral caudate atrophy.

DEVELOPMENT Neuropathology is extremely restricted, with atrophy occurring in the striatum and, to a lesser extent, in the cerebral cortex. Microscopically, the neuropathology is characterized by neuronal loss, reactive gliosis, and intraneuronal protein aggregates. Since the initial description of this disease by George Huntington in 1872, substantial advance has been achieved in the understanding of this pathology. The pathogenic gene and mutation were identified in 1993. This allowed the generation of multiple in vitro, cellular, and animal models of Huntington s disease. These studies have originated multiple hypotheses regarding the mechanism by which huntingtin with an expanded poly glutamine tract exerts its toxicity.

The RCAN1 gene encodes regulators of calcineurin, and we now demonstrate, for the first time, that RCAN1-1L is depressed in Huntington disease. We also show that RCAN1-1L overexpression can protect against mutant huntingtin toxicity in an ST14A cell culture model of Huntington disease and that increased phosphorylation of huntingtin via calcineurin inhibition, rather than via Akt induction or activation, is the likely mechanism by which RCAN1-1L may be protective against mutant huntingtin. These findings suggest that RCAN1-1L \"deficiency\" may actually play a role in the etiology of Huntington disease. In addition, our results allow for the possibility that controlled overexpression of RCAN1-1L in the striatal region of the brain might be a viable avenue for therapeutic intervention in Huntington disease patients (and perhaps other polyglutamine expansion disorders)."

In this respect, HSS may serve as a model for complex neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalopathy, in which pathologic accumulation of iron in the brain is also observed. Thus, understanding the biochemical defect in HSS may provide key insights into the regulation of iron metabolism and its perturbation in this and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Huntington disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntington disease gene. The symptomatic phase of the disease is defined by the onset of motor symptoms. However, psychiatric disturbances, including depression, are common features of Huntington disease and recent studies indicate that depression can occur long before the manifestation of motor symptoms. The aetiology of depression in Huntington disease is not fully understood and psychosocial factors such as the knowledge of carrying a mutation for an incurable disease or adverse social circumstances may contribute to its presentation. Due to the difficulties in discriminating between social and biological factors as contributors to depression in clinical Huntington disease, we chose to assess whether a model for Huntington disease not subject to environmental stressors, namely the YAC mouse model of Huntington disease, displays a depressive phenotype. Indeed, the YAC transgenic mice recapitulate the early depressive phenotype of Huntington disease as assessed by the Porsolt forced swim test as well as the sucrose intake test as a measure of anhedonia. The YAC model mirrors clinical Huntington disease in that there were no effects of CAG repeat length or disease duration on the depressive phenotype. The depressive phenotype was completely rescued in YAC transgenic animals expressing a variant of mutant huntingtin that is resistant to cleavage at amino acid 586 suggesting that therapies aimed towards inhibition of huntingtin cleavage are also likely to have beneficial effects on this aspect of the disease. In conclusion, our study provides strong support for a primary neurobiological basis for depression in Huntington disease."

PURPOSE Pre-prostate specific antigen era series demonstrated an increased risk of bladder cancer and rectal cancer in men who received radiotherapy for prostate cancer. We estimated the risk of secondary bladder cancer and rectal cancer after prostate radiotherapy using a contemporary population based cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified 243,082 men in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database who underwent radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer between 1988 and 2003. We estimated the incidence rate, standardized incidence ratio and age adjusted incidence rate ratio of subsequent bladder cancer and rectal cancer associated with radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and a combination of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. RESULTS The relative risk of bladder cancer developing after external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy compared to radical prostatectomy was 1.88, 1.52 and 1.85, respectively. Compared to the general United States population the standardized incidence ratio for bladder cancer developing after radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy was 0.99, 1.42, 1.10 and 1.39, respectively. The relative risk of rectal cancer developing after external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy compared to radical prostatectomy was 1.26, 1.08 and 1.21, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS Men who receive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer have an increased risk of bladder cancer compared to patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and compared to the general population. The risk of rectal cancer is increased in patients who receive external beam radiotherapy compared to radical prostatectomy. Patients should be counseled appropriately regarding these risks."

OBJECTIVES To review our perioperative experience with patients presenting with high-risk bladder cancer who had undergone prior therapy for prostate cancer. With the increase in diagnosis and subsequent treatment of prostate cancer, more patients presenting with high-risk bladder cancer have undergone prior therapy for prostate cancer. Radical cystectomy in these patients can be technically challenging and may be associated with added morbidity. METHODS A retrospective review of 458 patients treated with radical cystectomy between January 1993 and January 2002 revealed 29 patients (mean age 72 years) who had received definitive treatment for prostate cancer prior to cystectomy for bladder carcinoma. The initial treatment in this cohort was radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy in 12 (41%) and 17 (59%) men, respectively. Cystectomy was performed for transitional cell carcinoma in 25 (86%), small cell carcinoma in 2 (6%), and sarcoma in 2 (6%) patients. RESULTS At the time of cystectomy, the mean blood loss was 1175 mL (range 275 to 3500), and the median length of hospitalization was 8 days (range 4 to 23). No intraoperative or perioperative deaths occurred in this cohort. Twenty-seven early complications were identified in 16 (55%) of 29 patients; no rectal injuries occurred. Patients with prior radiotherapy had a higher rate of extravesical bladder carcinoma (60%) than those patients treated with prior prostatectomy (33%). An orthotopic neobladder diversion was created in 5 patients (17%). CONCLUSIONS Patients with bladder cancer previously treated for prostate cancer with external beam radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy have an increased risk of perioperative complications compared with patients undergoing cystectomy without prior therapy. This risk is not prohibitive, and radical cystectomy should remain the treatment of choice for high-risk bladder cancer in this population. Furthermore, orthotopic urinary diversion may be a reasonable option and should be considered in select patients."

OBJECTIVE Although it is well known that radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer, the effect of aging and smoking with radiotherapy on incidence rate of secondary bladder cancer remains unknown. Then, this study investigated the combinational effect of external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer and aging or smoking on comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer. METHODS This study included 754 Japanese patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy (n = 319) and radical prostatectomy (n = 435) from 2000 through 2013. The relationship between therapeutic modality for prostate cancer as well as age or smoking status and comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer was examined. RESULTS During the median follow-up period of 4.3 and 3.1 years, secondary bladder cancer occurred in 11 (3.4%) and 5 (1.1%) of patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy, respectively. The 5-year bladder cancer-free survival rate was 97.3% in the external beam radiotherapy group and 99.4% in the radical prostatectomy group. Age (hazard ratio = 1.15, P = 0.027) and ever smoking (hazard ratio = 5.65, P = 0.011) were significant predictive factors of secondary bladder cancer incidence in the external beam radiotherapy cohort, but not in the radical prostatectomy cohort. Inversely, among men with ever smoking, but not among older men, external beam radiotherapy (hazard ratio = 9.64, P = 0.0052) was a significant risk factor of secondary bladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these findings suggest that smoking history might be one of criteria to choose radical prostatectomy than external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and that age would not be a criterion for therapeutic selection in terms of secondary bladder cancer."

OBJECTIVE Consistency in target organ and organ at risk position from planning to treatment is an important basic principle of radiotherapy. This study evaluates the effectiveness of bladder-filling instructions in achieving a consistent and reproducible bladder volume at the time of planning CT and daily during the course of radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer. It also assessed the rate of bladder filling before and at the end of radiotherapy. METHODS 30 men attending for radiation therapy planning for prostate cancer received written and verbal bladder-filling instructions. They had their bladder volume assessed using a bladder ultrasound scanner post-void, immediately prior to planning CT scan and then daily immediately prior to treatment while in the therapy position. The inflow was calculated using the void and full bladder volumes and the time for the bladder to fill. RESULTS The mean bladder volume at the time of planning was 282 ml (range 89-608 ml, standard deviation (SD) = 144.5 ml). This fell during treatment, with a mean value for all treatments of 189 ml (range 11-781 ml, SD = 134 ml). During radiotherapy, 76% (828/1090), 53% (579/1090) and 36% (393/1090) of bladder volumes had >50 ml, >100 ml and >150 ml difference, respectively when compared with their volume at the time of planning. Inflow reduced from 4.6 ml min(-1), SD = 2.9 min(-1) at planning to 2.5 min(-1), SD = 1.8 min(-1) after radiotherapy. CONCLUSION The Bladderscan device (BVI 6400 Bladderscan, Verathon Medical UK, Sandford, UK) provides an effective means of assessing bladder volume prior to radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

OBJECTIVES As the number of prostate cancer survivors is increasing, the long-term health of prostate cancer patients has become a significant health issue. Radiation is known to induce malignant transformation, and prostate cancer radiotherapy is suggested to induce secondary malignancies. This report reviews the available data regarding the risk of secondary cancer after radiation for prostate cancer. METHODS Epidemiological studies of the secondary cancer risk in patients with a history of prostate cancer radiation and the literature regarding radiation-induced carcinogenesis were reviewed. RESULTS Prostate cancer is not associated with an increased number of additional malignancies. The data suggests a modest increase in secondary cancers associated with radiation for prostate cancer, as approximately one in 70 patients undergoing radiation and surviving more than 10 yr will develop secondary cancer. The most common sites for secondary cancers are bladder and rectum. In addition to the cancers adjacent to the radiation field, there is also an increase of cancers in distant sites, such as lung. The increased risk for secondary cancers is reported after external radiation, not after brachytherapy. The available data originated from studies of patients undergoing conventional radiotherapy. New treatment methods, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, may be associated with a higher risk of secondary cancers. CONCLUSION Although the incidence of secondary cancers after prostate cancer radiotherapy is not dramatically different from the overall population, patients should be informed about this risk. Other treatment modalities should be considered for patients with long life expectancy and for patients with additional risk factors."

BACKGROUND To investigate the risk of second cancer and radiation induced second cancer following prostate cancer radiotherapy. METHODS We compared men with radiotherapy only with those treated with radical prostatectomy only and those with radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy. Cumulative incidences of second cancers were calculated. Cox analyses were performed to identify determinants influencing second cancer incidence. RESULTS Nineteen thousand five hundred thirty eight patients were analyzed. Age and median follow-up differed significantly with radiotherapy only patients having the highest median age (70.3 years) and radical prostatectomy only patients the longest median follow-up (10.2 years). Ten-year cumulative incidence of second cancer was 15.9%, 13.2% and 10.5% for patients with radiotherapy only, radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy and radical prostatectomy only (p <0.0001). Increasing age and belonging to the radiotherapy only group were associated with a higher risk of second cancer-no significant increase was seen in radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy patients. A significantly higher rate of smoking related malignancies, like lung, bladder and non-melanoma skin cancer, was seen in radiotherapy only patients. CONCLUSIONS No clear increase in radiation induced second cancer was found in patients after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Whereas the rate of second cancer was increased in radiotherapy only patients, no such increase was seen in patients with radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy. The increase of second cancer following radiotherapy only is highly likely to reflect advanced age and lifestyle habits and comorbidities."

BACKGROUND Although emerging evidence demonstrates increased risk of secondary bladder cancer following pelvic radiotherapy, the aggressiveness of these tumors is not well-characterized. MATERIALS AND METHODS A search of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 Database, identified 25,734 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer following definitive therapy for previous pelvic malignancy. Kaplan-Meier curve analyses were utilized to determine overall survival with significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS Of the 25,734 patients, 11,376 (44.2%) received radiation treatment for their first cancer. Overall survival of bladder cancer was found to be 80%, 69.5%, and 49.2% at 1,2 and 5 years, respectively. There was no significant survival difference between groups whose first cancer was treated with or without radiation (p=0.8). A survival advantage was seen for the bladder cancer patients not treated with radiation for cervical (p=0.004), uterine (p=0.0006), and vaginal cancers (p<0.0001). Bladder cancer patients treated with radiation for prostate cancer showed a survival advantage (p=0.002). The average time to second cancer diagnosis was 6.5\u00b16.1 years. Patients treated with radiation for first primary cancer showed a longer time to second cancer (7.2\u00b16.0 years) compared to those treated without radiation (5.9\u00b16.0 years) (p<0.01). CONCLUSION Patients with prior history of female cancers treated without radiation demonstrated significant survival advantage in second primary bladder cancer. A small significant survival advantage was seen in bladder cancer patients previously treated for prostate cancer with radiation. This data suggests that second primary bladder cancer following pelvic radiotherapy has similar biologic aggressiveness to urothelial carcinoma developing without a history of radiotherapy. MICROABSTRACT The overall survival of 25,734 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer following definitive therapy for a previous pelvic malignancy was 49.2% at 5 years. There was no significant survival difference between groups whose first cancer was treated with or without radiation. Second primary bladder cancer following pelvic radiotherapy has similar biologic aggressiveness to urothelial carcinoma developing without a history of radiotherapy."

PURPOSE More than half of the men who receive treatment for prostate cancer elect radiotherapy. After radiotherapy recurrence is determined by an increase in prostate specific antigen and not usually by pathological confirmation. We describe the prevalence of persistent gradable prostate cancer in men treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer at radical cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 78 patients underwent radiotherapy (brachytherapy and/or external beam radiation) before the development of bladder cancer requiring radical cystectomy at our institution. All tissues were evaluated by a specialized genitourinary pathologist. RESULTS Median time from radiotherapy to radical cystoprostatectomy was 77 months. Gradable prostate cancer was identified in 45% of patients. Of the tumors 69% were Gleason score 7 or greater, 17% were pT3 or greater and 5% showed positive lymph nodes. Men treated more recently were less likely to have gradable prostate cancer, including 100% before 1980, 49% between 1980 and 2000 and 10% from 2000 to the present (p=0.002) as were those who received external beam radiation alone compared to brachytherapy and combined brachytherapy/external beam radiation (58% vs 27% and 14%, respectively, p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS After radiotherapy 45% of men had persistent prostate cancer (37% of men with no evidence of disease). A decreased prostate cancer rate was associated with later treatment year and combined brachytherapy/external beam radiation regimens. Similar to men treated with radical cystoprostatectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer, meticulous attention should be paid during prostate removal in men treated with radiotherapy because many may have persistent prostate cancer. In addition, markers other than prostate specific antigen should be studied in men treated with radiotherapy to better identify those with biochemical recurrence."

External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is frequently used in the management of prostate cancer (PCa) as definitive, postoperative, or salvage local treatment. Although EBRT plays a central role in the management of PCa, complications remain a troubling by-product. Several studies have demonstrated an association between radiotherapy and elevated risk of acute and late toxicities. A secondary malignancy induced by initial therapy represents one of the most serious complications related to definitive cancer treatment. The radiation-related secondary primary malignancy risk increases with increasing survival time. Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder is the most frequent secondary primary malignancy occurring after radiotherapy and is described as more aggressive; it may be diagnosed later because some radiation oncologists believe that the hematuria that occurs after prostate EBRT is normal. Some patients treated for localized PCa will subsequently develop invasive bladder cancer requiring surgical intervention. Patients with PCa treated with EBRT should be monitored closely for the presence of bladder cancer."

The wings apart-like protein (Wapl) is a key negative regulator of cohesin and forms a complex with precocious dissociation of sisters protein 5 (Pds5) to promote cohesin release from chromatin. Here we report the crystal structure and functional characterization of human Wapl. Wapl contains a flexible, variable N-terminal region (Wapl-N) and a conserved C-terminal domain (Wapl-C) consisting of eight HEAT (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, A subunit, and target of rapamycin) repeats. Wapl-C folds into an elongated structure with two lobes. Structure-based mutagenesis maps the functional surface of Wapl-C to two distinct patches (I and II) on the N lobe and a localized patch (III) on the C lobe. Mutating critical patch I residues weaken Wapl binding to cohesin and diminish sister-chromatid resolution and cohesin release from mitotic chromosomes in human cells and Xenopus egg extracts. Surprisingly, patch III on the C lobe does not contribute to Wapl binding to cohesin or its known regulators. Although patch I mutations reduce Wapl binding to intact cohesin, they do not affect Wapl-Pds5 binding to the cohesin subcomplex of sister chromatid cohesion protein 1 (Scc1) and stromal antigen 2 (SA2) in vitro, which is instead mediated by Wapl-N. Thus, Wapl-N forms extensive interactions with Pds5 and Scc1-SA2. Wapl-C interacts with other cohesin subunits and possibly unknown effectors to trigger cohesin release from chromatin."

Wapl induces cohesin dissociation from DNA throughout the mitotic cell cycle, modulating sister chromatid cohesion and higher-order chromatin structure. Cohesin complexes containing meiosis-specific kleisin subunits govern most aspects of meiotic chromosome function, but whether Wapl regulates these complexes remains unknown. We show that during C. elegans oogenesis WAPL-1 antagonizes binding of cohesin containing COH-3/4 kleisins, but not REC-8, demonstrating that sensitivity to WAPL-1 is dictated by kleisin identity. By restricting the amount of chromosome-associated COH-3/4 cohesin, WAPL-1 controls chromosome structure throughout meiotic prophase. In the absence of REC-8, WAPL-1 inhibits COH-3/4-mediated cohesion, which requires crossover-fated events formed during meiotic recombination. Thus, WAPL-1 promotes functional specialization of meiotic cohesin: WAPL-1-sensitive COH-3/4 complexes modulate higher-order chromosome structure, while WAPL-1-refractory REC-8 complexes provide stable cohesion. Surprisingly, a WAPL-1-independent mechanism removes cohesin before metaphase I.

The establishment of stable sister chromatid cohesion during DNA replication requires acetylation of the chromosomal cohesin complex by the replication fork-associated acetyltransferase Eco1. Cohesin acetylation is thought to facilitate replication fork progression by counteracting an as yet ill-defined cohesion \"antiestablishment\" activity imposed by the Wapl protein. Here, using budding yeast, we find no evidence that cohesin acetylation must overcome Wapl during replication fork progression. Instead, Wapl emerges as a negative regulator of cohesion maintenance in G2, a function that it likely exerts through its role as destabilizer of unacetylated, chromosome-bound cohesin. Our results suggest that acetylation renders cohesin Wapl-resistant from S phase onward until mitosis. In the absence of Wapl, sister chromatid cohesion functions well, suggesting that Wapl partakes in a cohesin function outside of sister chromatid cohesion. We find that Wapl is not required for cohesin's known role in transcriptional regulation. Rather, cells lacking Wapl display increased chromosome condensation in both interphase and mitosis. Thus, as a conserved regulator of cohesin dynamics on chromosomes, Wapl controls cohesion maintenance after its establishment in S phase and adjusts the chromosome condensation status."

BACKGROUND The linkage between duplicated chromosomes (sister chromatids) is established during S phase by the action of cohesin, a multisubunit complex conserved from yeast to humans. Most cohesin dissociates from chromosome arms when the cell enters mitotic prophase, leading to the formation of metaphase chromosomes with two cytologically discernible chromatids. This process is known as sister-chromatid resolution. Although two mitotic kinases have been implicated in this process, it remains unknown exactly how the cohesin-mediated linkage is destabilized at a mechanistic level. RESULTS The wings apart-like (Wapl) protein was originally identified as a gene product that potentially regulates heterochromatin organization in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that the human ortholog of Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that facilitates cohesin's timely release from chromosome arms during prophase. Depletion of Wapl from HeLa cells causes transient accumulation of prometaphase-like cells with chromosomes that display poorly resolved sister chromatids with a high level of cohesin. Reduction of cohesin relieves the Wapl-depletion phenotype, and depletion of Wapl rescues premature sister separation observed in Sgo1-depleted or Esco2-depleted cells. Conversely, overexpression of Wapl causes premature separation of sister chromatids. Wapl physically associates with cohesin in HeLa-cell nuclear extracts. Remarkably, in vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrate that Wapl forms a stoichiometric, ternary complex with two regulatory subunits of cohesin, implicating its noncatalytic function in inactivating cohesin's ability to interact with chromatin. CONCLUSIONS Wapl is a new regulator of sister chromatid resolution and promotes release of cohesin from chromosomes by directly interacting with its regulatory subunits."

Pds5 is also essential for sister chromatid cohesion, indicating that it has functions beyond cohesin removal. The Brca2 DNA repair protein interacts with Pds5, but the roles of this complex beyond DNA repair are unknown. Here we show that Brca2 opposes Pds5 function in sister chromatid cohesion by assaying precocious sister chromatid separation in metaphase spreads of cultured cells depleted for these proteins. By genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation we find that Pds5 facilitates SA cohesin subunit association with DNA replication origins and that Brca2 inhibits SA binding, mirroring their effects on sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesin binding is maximal at replication origins and extends outward to occupy active genes and regulatory sequences. Pds5 and Wapl, but not Brca2, limit the distance that cohesin extends from origins, thereby determining which active genes, enhancers and silencers bind cohesin. Using RNA-seq we find that Brca2, Pds5 and Wapl influence the expression of most genes sensitive to Nipped-B and cohesin, largely in the same direction. These findings demonstrate that Brca2 regulates sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression in addition to its canonical role in DNA repair and expand the known functions of accessory proteins in cohesin's diverse functions."

The wapl gene encodes two proteins, a long form and a short form. wapl(AG) introduces a stop codon at amino acid 271 of the long form and produces a truncated protein. The expression of a transgene encoding the truncated Wapl-AG protein causes an extra-sex-comb phenotype similar to that seen in the wapl(AG) mutant. Mutations in the cohesin-associated genes Nipped-B and pds5 suppress and enhance wapl(AG) phenotypes, respectively. A Pds5-Wapl complex (releasin) removes cohesin from DNA, while Nipped-B loads cohesin. This suggests that Wapl-AG might exert its effects through changes in cohesin binding. Consistent with this model, Wapl-AG was found to increase the stability of cohesin binding to polytene chromosomes.

Whether this noncanonical function is conserved among species is still unknown. METHODS We applied RNAi-based gene silencing approach to deplete WAPL in porcine oocytes, validating the conserved roles of WAPL in the regulation of SAC activity during mammalian oocyte maturation. We also employed immunostaining, immunoblotting and image quantification analyses to test the WAPL depletion on the meiotic progression, spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and dynamics of SAC protein in porcine oocytes. RESULTS We showed that depletion of WAPL resulted in the accelerated meiotic progression by displaying the precocious polar body extrusion and compromised spindle assembly and chromosome alignment. Notably, we observed that the protein level of BUB3 was substantially reduced in WAPL-depleted oocytes, especially at kinetochores. CONCLUSIONS Collectively, our data demonstrate that WAPL participates in the porcine oocyte meiotic progression through maintenance of BUB3 protein levels and SAC activity.

Using conditional mutagenesis in the mouse, here we show that depletion of the cohesin-associated protein Wapl stably locks cohesin on DNA, leads to clustering of cohesin in axial structures, and causes chromatin condensation in interphase chromosomes. These findings reveal that the stability of cohesin-DNA interactions is an important determinant of chromatin structure, and indicate that cohesin has an architectural role in interphase chromosome territories. Furthermore, we show that regulation of cohesin-DNA interactions by Wapl is important for embryonic development, expression of genes such as c-myc (also known as Myc), and cell cycle progression. In mitosis, Wapl-mediated release of cohesin from DNA is essential for proper chromosome segregation and protects cohesin from cleavage by the protease separase, thus enabling mitotic exit in the presence of functional cohesin complexes."

How this is achieved is poorly understood. Here, we show that the interaction between cohesin and chromatin is controlled by Wapl, a protein implicated in heterochromatin formation and tumorigenesis. Wapl is associated with cohesin throughout the cell cycle, and its depletion blocks cohesin dissociation from chromosomes during the early stages of mitosis and prevents the resolution of sister chromatids until anaphase, which occurs after a delay.

Here, we show that windows of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides and putative pioneer factor interactions mark enhancers for at least some tissue-specific genes in ES cells. The unmethylated windows expand in cells that express the gene and contract, disappear, or remain unchanged in nonexpressing tissues.

After stable integration of premethylated Ptcra enhancer constructs into the ES cell genome, the unmethylated windows readily appeared. In contrast, the premethylated constructs remained fully methylated and silent after introduction into Ptcra-expressing thymocytes. These findings provide initial functional support for a model in which pioneer factor interactions in ES cells promote the assembly of a chromatin structure that is permissive for subsequent activation, and in which differentiated tissues lack the machinery required for gene activation when these ES cell marks are absent.

Enhancers are cis-acting elements with many sites bound by transcription factors and activate transcription over long distance. Histone modifications are critical for enhancer activity and utilized as hallmarks for the identification of putative enhancers. Monomethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) is the mark for enhancer priming; acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) for active enhancers and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) for silent enhancers. Recent studies from multiple groups have provided evidence that enhancer reprogramming, especially gain of enhancer activity, is closely related to tumorigenesis and cancer development. In this review, we will summarize the recent discoveries about enhancer regulation and the mechanisms of enhancer reprogramming in tumorigenesis, and discuss the potential application of enhancer manipulation in precision medicine."

Here, we characterize the localization, the biogenesis, and the function of an atypical heterochromatin, which is simultaneously enriched in the typical H3K9me3 mark and in H3K36me3, a histone mark usually associated with gene expression. We identified thousands of dual regions in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that rely on the histone methyltransferases SET domain bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) and nuclear set domain (NSD)-containing proteins to generate H3K9me3 and H3K36me3, respectively. Upon SETDB1 removal, dual domains lose both marks, gain signatures of active enhancers, and come into contact with upregulated genes, suggesting that it might be an important pathway by which genes are controlled by heterochromatin. In differentiated tissues, a subset of these dual domains is destabilized and becomes enriched in active enhancer marks, providing a mechanistic insight into the involvement of heterochromatin in the maintenance of cell identity."

Jaundice is a clinical manifestation of disorders of underlying bilirubin metabolism, hepatocellular dysfunction, or biliary obstruction. As clinical presentations of yellowing of eyes or skin can be somewhat nonspecific for the underlying etiology of disease, a stepwise approach to evaluation is necessary for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plan. In this review, we discuss underlying mechanisms of cholestasis and jaundice as well as laboratory and imaging modalities needed to evaluate a patient presenting with hyperbilirubinemia. Jaundice occurs in settings of cholestasis or inability to effectively secrete bile as well as disorders of bilirubin metabolism and hepatocellular dysfunction. Clinical signs of jaundice occur when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.5 to 3 mg/dL. In all cases, evaluation begins with liver chemistry tests which include bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total protein. In patients with hepatobiliary causes of jaundice, the alkaline phosphatase is usually elevated. In these cases, evaluation of hepatic synthetic function is crucial to the formulation of a treatment plant. When serologic evaluation is combined with hepatobiliary imaging, underlying mechanism of disease can often be elucidated. A stepwise approach to evaluation can be cost and time saving as well as a framework to improve patient outcomes. In this review, we will outline a diagnostic approach to jaundice, beginning with pathophysiology of cholestasis followed by hyperbilirubinemia and markers of synthetic dysfunction."

Jaundice related to malignant tumors is classified as obstructive jaundice. This disease proceeds from biliary tract obstruction and liver failure by progression of intrahepatic tumors, including metastases from other malignancies. Biliary tract cancer, pancreatic head cancer, or lymph nodes metastases from other sites of cancer are mainly responsible for the obstruction of the bile duct. In patients with obstructive jaundice, biliary drainage is often required in order to give treatments such as chemotherapy. In patients with biliary drainage, various complications arise, such as cholangitis due to obstruction ofa biliary stent, and bleeding from the ulcer due to a dislodged stent to the duodenum. It is crucial to manage those complications as oncologic emergencies. Jaundice of liver failure due to hepatic metastases is often observed in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies such as gastric cancer or colorectal cancer. Although chemotherapy is the usual application for those patients, useful anti-cancer agents are limited. It is crucial to diagnose and decide the best treatments as soon as possible for patients with very advanced hepatic metastases."

A large number of patients present with jaundice and encephalopathy in tropical country like India and acute liver failure is the usual cause. Clinical presentation like ALF is also a complication of many tropical infections, and these conditions may mimic ALF but may have subtle differences from ALF. Moreover, what hepatologists see as acute liver failure in tropics is different from what is commonly described in Western Textbooks. Paracetamol overdose, which is possibly the commonest cause of ALF in UK and USA, is hardly ever seen in India. Most common etiology here is viral hepatitis (hepatitis E > hepatitis B> hepatitis A). Apart from ALF, one may also come across subacute hepatic failure (SAHF) as well as acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) due to viral hepatitis. Interestingly, a host of other conditions can mimic ALF because clinical presentation in these conditions can be dominated by jaundice and encephalopathy. Malarial hepatopathy is possibly the best-known condition out of these and is not an uncommon manifestation of severe malaria. A similar presentation can also be seen in other common infections in tropics such as dengue fever, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, amoebic liver abscesses, tuberculosis and other bacterial and fungal infections with or without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related disease. In many of these conditions, liver failure may not be underlying pathophysiology. Some pregnancy related liver diseases could also present with jaundice and encephalopathy.

BACKGROUND Uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) gene family is involved in the detoxification of biomaterials and drugs in the liver. Among the UGT gene family members, only UGT1A1 is involved in bilirubin conjugation. As a result, deficient UGT1A1 activity causes jaundice. One disease that is characterized by reduced UGT1A1 activity is Gilbert's syndrome. Two prevalent UGT1A1 polymorphisms responsible for Gilbert's syndrome have been identified: G71R in exon 1 and A(TA)7TAA in the TATA box of the promoter region. Recently, the G71R polymorphism has been associated with breastfeeding jaundice and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in term infants. However, its association with jaundice in very low birth weight infants (VLBWIs) has never been reported. CASE PRESENTATION The patient was a female born at 28 weeks, 4 days gestation with a birth weight of 1172 g. On day 21, intense yellowing of the skin and eyes was noted, and the patient's total bilirubin level was 23.7 mg/dL (her direct bilirubin level was 2.1 mg/dL). Therefore, an exchange transfusion was conducted. She had neither blood type incompatibility nor a family history of constitutional jaundice. Metabolic screens for amino and organic acids were negative. No elevation of any of the examined antibody titers was noted, and no evidence of an inflammatory reaction was observed. In addition, no hematological abnormalities were detected. The direct/indirect Coombs test, irregular antibody test and red blood cell antibody dissociation test were all negative, and her thyroid function was normal. We performed sequence analysis of the UGT1A1 gene after the patient's parents provided written informed consent. Exon 1 of the UGT1 gene on chromosome 2 was analyzed by direct sequencing. A heterozygous substitution from G to A (211G\u2192A: G71R) in base 211 was noted. CONCLUSION We speculated that this preterm infant with carrying the G71R polymorphism reduced UGT1A1 activity and developed severe jaundice that was likely triggered by factors such as breast feeding and medications. The polymorphism appears at some frequency among VLBWIs, which would necessitate adequate care of severe jaundice even after the acute phase."

INVESTIGATIONS Physical examination showed jaundice of skin and sclera as well as conjunctivitis of both eyes. Blood examination results indicated high levels of bilirubin (mostly conjugated), C-reactive protein and creatinine. There were no pathological findings in the ultrasound examination except of discrete splenomegaly. Serology revealed Leptospira IgM antibodies. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE The patient was diagnosed with leptospirosis and was treated with intravenous ceftriaxon, intravenous rehydration and symptomatic analgesia. Upon this treatment, the liver and kidney function recovered and the patient could be discharged from the hospital in a good general condition. CONCLUSIONS Leptospirosis is a zoonosis which is mainly transmitted by urine of infected animals (predominantly rodents). In this case, the disease was presumably transmitted during the patients work as a professional punt-driver on the Neckar River. The course of the disease is mostly mild with flu-like symptoms, but there are also serious courses with live-threatening complications such as liver or kidney failure and an associated high mortality rate."

As part of the United States Pharmacopeia's ongoing review of dietary supplement safety data, a new comprehensive systematic review on green tea extracts (GTE) has been completed. GTEs may contain hepatotoxic solvent residues, pesticide residues, pyrrolizidine alkaloids and elemental impurities, but no evidence of their involvement in GTE-induced liver injury was found during this review. GTE catechin profiles vary significantly with manufacturing processes. Animal and human data indicate that repeated oral administration of bolus doses of GTE during fasting significantly increases bioavailability of catechins, specifically EGCG, possibly involving saturation of first-pass elimination mechanisms. Toxicological studies show a hepatocellular pattern of liver injury. Published adverse event case reports associate hepatotoxicity with EGCG intake amounts from 140 mg to \u223c1000 mg/day and substantial inter-individual variability in susceptibility, possibly due to genetic factors. Based on these findings, USP included a cautionary labeling requirement in its Powdered Decaffeinated Green Tea Extract monograph that reads as follows: \"Do not take on an empty stomach.

However, in this article, we present a case of a middle-aged female patient with SLE who exhibited persistent skin jaundice as her initial symptom, offering a fresh perspective on diagnosing and treating patients who exhibit unexplained liver dysfunction and SLE combined with liver injury. PATIENT CONCERNS A 45-year-old woman was initially admitted to the hospital due to yellowing of the skin and sclera, and her symptoms did not improve significantly during treatment. The results were abnormal after relevant immunological tests. DIAGNOSES Persistent non-conjugated bilirubin elevation due to lupus hepatitis.

BACKGROUND Sandoz etanercept (SDZ ETN; GP2015) is an etanercept biosimilar with equivalent efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity to reference etanercept (ETN) in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. METHODS EQUIRA was a phase III, double-blind study conducted in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous 50 mg SDZ ETN or ETN, once-weekly, for 24 weeks. At week 24, patients with at least moderate EULAR response in the SDZ ETN group continued SDZ ETN treatment, and those in the ETN group were switched to receive 50 mg SDZ ETN, for up to 48 weeks. Patients received concomitant methotrexate at a stable dose (10-25 mg/week) and folic acid (\u2265 5 mg/week). Equivalence between SDZ ETN and ETN for change from baseline in disease activity score including 28 joint count C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) at week 24 (primary endpoint) and comparable safety and immunogenicity profile of SDZ ETN and ETN have previously been demonstrated at week 24. Herein, we present the 48-week results of the study after a single switch from ETN to its biosimilar at week 24. RESULTS The least squares mean (standard error) change in DAS28-CRP from baseline up to week 48 was comparable between \"continued SDZ ETN\" (- 2.90 [0.12], n = 148) and \"switched to SDZ ETN\" (- 2.78 [0.13], n = 131) groups. The proportion of patients achieving EULAR good/moderate responses based on DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate and ACR20/50/70 response rates were comparable between the two groups. The proportion of patients with at least one treatment-emergent adverse event was 42.9% in the \"continued SDZ ETN\" and 38.0% in the \"switched to SDZ ETN\" groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients in each of the two groups. After week 24, none of the patients in the switched group developed anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), while 4 patients in the continued SDZ ETN group had single-event, very low titer, non-neutralizing ADAs detected. CONCLUSIONS The 48-week results from the EQUIRA study demonstrate that switch from ETN to SDZ ETN in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis does not impact the efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity of etanercept.

Etanercept (ETN) and other anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents have revolutionised the management of spondyloarthropathies (SpA). With the increasingly widespread and prolonged use of these drugs an assessment of their long-term safety is extremely important. An additional concern regarding biological agents is their higher costs compared with conventional drugs. We examined safety data regarding ETN from clinical reports, clinical trials, review articles, databases and registries. In addition, evidence was reviewed about the cost effectiveness of ETN in the treatment of patients with SpA. Our review suggests that ETN is well tolerated as long-term, continuous treatment of SpA with a favourable risk-benefit ratio maintained from 4 to 5 years. Diversity in structure and mode of action could explain some differences in the safety profile of ETN with respect to the other anti-TNF agents. In particular, ETN is less immunogenic and is less likely to induce tuberculosis re-activation than the other TNF-\u03b1 antagonists. Although ETN is considerably more expensive than conventional therapy, it reduces direct and indirect costs associated to SpA by improving disease activity and quality of life. Recent pharmacoeconomic studies have demonstrated its cost-effectiveness in the treatment of SpA."

OBJECTIVE To assess real-world safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of etanercept monotherapy, etanercept plus methotrexate (MTX), or etanercept plus other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) in Japanese patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite previous treatment with DMARD. METHODS In this 24-week, all-cases postmarketing surveillance study, adverse events (AE) were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Effectiveness was assessed every 4 weeks using the 28-joint Disease Activity Score and the European League Against Rheumatism response criteria. RESULTS Of 13,861 patients (81% women) in the analysis, 3616, 2506, and 7739, respectively, were classified into etanercept monotherapy (ETN-mono), etanercept plus DMARD other than MTX (ETN + DMARD), and etanercept plus MTX (ETN + MTX) groups. Rates of AE and serious AE (SAE) in the ETN + MTX group were lower than in other groups. Risk of SAE or serious infections was not significantly increased with higher versus lower MTX doses at baseline or with concomitant use of salazosulfapyridine or bucillamine in ETN + DMARD versus ETN-mono groups. A greater likelihood of achieving clinical remission was seen with ETN + MTX versus ETN-mono (OR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.16-1.60; p < 0.001). Higher MTX dose at baseline was associated with a higher remission rate (> 8 mg vs 0 to \u2264 4 mg, OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.00, p = 0.016; 6 to \u2264 8 mg vs 0 to \u2264 4 mg, OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.60, p = 0.038). CONCLUSION Combination therapies with etanercept plus MTX or other DMARD were reasonably well tolerated, and ETN + MTX at higher doses was more effective than ETN-mono in Japanese patients with RA."

Introduction: Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been revolutionized by the introduction of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. With patent expiry approaching for many expensive biologic molecules, such as etanercept, more affordable biosimilar drugs are being developed. LBEC0101 is an etanercept biosimilar approved in Japan and South Korea for all etanercept indications including RA. Areas covered: We discuss the pharmacological characteristics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of LBEC0101 compared with the etanercept reference product (ETN-RP). Preclinical studies showed that the binding affinity to TNF\u03b1 and biological activity of LBEC0101 were similar to those of the ETN-RP. The pharmacokinetic profile of LBEC0101 was also similar to that of the ETN-RP. A Phase III, randomized, double-blind, 54-week study showed that the efficacy of LBEC0101 was equivalent to that of the ETN-RP in RA patients. An extension study showed that efficacy was sustained long-term in patients receiving LBEC0101 and in those switching from the ETN-RP to LBEC0101. The safety profile of LBEC0101 was also confirmed to be comparable with the ETN-RP.

BACKGROUND Etanercept, a soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor, and acitretin have been shown to be effective in treating psoriasis. Acitretin is widely used in Korea. However, the combination of etanercept plus acitretin has not been evaluated among Korean patients with psoriasis. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with etanercept and acitretin in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS Sixty patients with psoriasis were randomized to receive etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (BIW) for 12 weeks followed by etanercept 25 mg BIW for 12 weeks (ETN-ETN); etanercept 25 mg BIW plus acitretin 10 mg twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks (ETN-ACT); or acitretin 10 mg BID for 24 weeks (ACT). The primary efficacy measurement was the proportion of patients achieving 75 % improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 24. Secondary end points included 50 % improvement in PASI (PASI 50) at week 24 and clear/almost-clear by Physician Global Assessment (PGA) at each visit through week 24. RESULTS The proportions of patients achieving PASI 75, PASI 50, and PGA clear/almost-clear at week 24 in the ETN-ETN (52.4, 71.4, and 52.4 %, respectively) and ETN-ACT groups (57.9, 84.2, and 52.6 %, respectively) were higher than in the ACT group (22.2, 44.4, and 16.7 %, respectively). The incidence of adverse events was similar across all arms. This was an open-label study with a small number of patients. CONCLUSION In Korean patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, etanercept alone or in combination with acitretin was more effective than acitretin. All treatments were well tolerated throughout the study. TRIAL REGISTRATION This study was registered on July 7, 2009 at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00936065 ."

OBJECTIVES This study assessed the relative efficacy of etanercept (ETN) or etanercept and methotrexate (ETN+MTX) for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had an unsatisfactory response to MTX, using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of function, pain, general health, disease activity and morning stiffness. METHODS The PROs were secondary assessments in a 16-week, prospective, randomised, parallel-group study conducted at 60 European centres. Patients with RA were randomly assigned either to monotherapy with ETN or combination therapy with ETN+MTX. PRO instruments administered included the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, the pain visual analogue scale, the EuroQoL assessment of current health state (EQ-5D), the EQ-5D visual analogue scale, a patient global assessment of disease activity and an assessment of morning stiffness. Treatment groups were compared by percentage of patients within clinically meaningful categories. The primary endpoint for all PROs was comparison of mean improvement from baseline to week 16 between ETN and ETN+MTX groups. RESULTS Three hundred and fifteen patients were randomised to ETN or ETN+MTX. Both treatment arms had similar Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index DI, EQ-5D, patient global assessment of disease activity, pain or morning stiffness scores and improvement from baseline to week 16. CONCLUSIONS For patients with active RA and intolerance or unsatisfactory response to MTX, substituting ETN for MTX and adding ETN to MTX are both effective ways of reducing disability, pain, disease activity, morning stiffness, and improving general health."

However, some patients show MTX intolerance; these patients may develop adverse events (AEs) or have risk factors for AEs. There is limited published information regarding the efficacy of combination therapy involving ETN and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs other than MTX. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of combination therapy with ETN and salazosulfapyridine (SASP) and/or bucillamine (Bc), a D: -penicillamine analogue, in MTX-intolerant RA patients. Indices of RA activity, including disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), were retrospectively analyzed over a 48-week period in 66 patients treated with ETN. Treatment efficacy was compared in the following 4 major treatment groups: ETN monotherapy, ETN + MTX, ETN + SASP, and ETN + SASP + Bc. Although intergroup differences in the percent change of DAS were not statistically significant, ETN + SASP + Bc seemed to be more effective than ETN monotherapy, and the efficacy of ETN + SASP + Bc was comparable to that of ETN + MTX according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) improvement ratings. These results suggest that ETN + SASP + Bc combination therapy may be a viable option for RA treatment in patients in whom MTX cannot be used."

INTRODUCTION Etanercept (ETN) is a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) antagonist used for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders. Injection site reactions (ISRs) are reported to be the most common adverse event of ETN therapy. While their mechanisms are not completely understood, the occurrence of ETN-ISRs could indicate a risk of systemic immune-mediated severe adverse drug reactions. AREAS COVERED Based on two cases and a review of the literature, the characteristics and frequency of ETN-ISRs were assessed. This article discusses their potential mechanisms and clinical relevance, and provides recommendations for the management of patients presenting with ETN-ISRs. EXPERT OPINION Basically, irritative and immune-mediated ISRs may be distinguished. The formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) may promote immune-mediated ISRs that likely represent either anaphylactic type I reactions, or cutaneous Arthus-like type III reactions according to the Coombs and Gell classification. A differentiation between these reactions by clinical course and etanercept-skin testing may help to decide if ETN treatment should be stopped to avoid the development of more severe adverse drug reactions if ISRs occur."

METHODS Tumour necrosis factor-inhibitor na\u00efve RA patients with disease activity score 28 (DAS28)\u22653.2, swollen joint count\u22653, despite stable MTX, were treated with ETN+MTX for 6 months, followed by randomisation to either continue ETN+MTX or switch to ETN monotherapy for an additional 18 months. The primary endpoint was change in DAS28 from 6-month randomisation to 12 months. The non-inferiority margin of change in DAS28 was 0.6, with prespecified analyses (DAS28<3.2 vs DAS28\u22653.2). RESULTS 205 patients were randomised. DAS28 was stable in patients on ETN+MTX and increased slightly in patients on ETN monotherapy from 6 to 12 months. Non-inferiority was not achieved, with an adjusted difference of 0.4 (0.1 to 0.7) between the ETN and the ETN+MTX groups, for the month 6-12 change in DAS28. However, patients who achieved low disease activity (LDA; DAS28<3.2) at 6 months had a similar disease activity at 12 months, whether on monotherapy or combination therapy (DAS28 change 0.7 ETN vs 0.57 ETN+MTX, p=0.8148).

BACKGROUND Today, the sun protection factor (SPF) value of sunscreen products is determined in vivo with a standardized protocol (EN ISO 24444:2010), and the measured SPF biological end point is the visible skin erythema. However, many of the sunscreen products currently available on the market have antiphlogistic ingredients, which may potentially result in an overestimated SPF of the sunscreen. AIMS To investigate the potential influence of the antiphlogistic ingredients panthenol and bisabolol in sunscreens on the determined SPF value in vivo. METHODS Formulations with different concentrations of the antiphlogistic ingredients bisabolol or panthenol were tested. As a reference, a base formulation (vehicle) without antiphlogistic ingredients was used. First, the SPF of the sunscreen formulas with and without antiphlogistic ingredients was analyzed in vitro. To investigate whether the antiphlogistic ingredient may suppress the inflammatory response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the SPF was determined in vivo. Finally, selected formulations were also analyzed in an erythema model for testing formulations on UV-induced inflammation. RESULTS It could be confirmed that no differences between the formula with and that without the active antiphlogistic ingredients bisabolol or panthenol exist when measured in vitro. However, there was also no statistically significant difference in the erythemal response between the vehicle (without an antiphlogistic active ingredient) and the test formulations with different concentrations of the antiphlogistic active ingredients in the in vivo determination of the SPF. Evidence of anti-inflammatory activity of the sunscreen antiphlogistics bisabolol and panthenol was also not apparent in the UV model over a time course of 48 h. Conlusion: The antiphlogistic ingredients panthenol and bisabolol incorporated in the tested sunscreen formula do not interfere with erythema reddening and thus do not affect the SPF value in vivo."

Histological reactions of the Sephadex induced acute inflammation were analyzed with and without presence of the exudate. MATERIAL AND METHODS Male and female Wistar rats (100-250 g). Sephadex G-200 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals). Sephadex B-200 (1 ml, swollen in 0.9% NaCl) was injected subcutaneously in the control group (C), whereas the experimental groups were injected with either untreated Sephadex taken from 1,3 and 5 days old inflammatory deposits (group A) or with Sephadex, extracted from those deposits but subsequently washed free by 0.9% NaCl (group B). Only the inner and not yet organized part of the Sephadex deposit was used in both experimental groups. In group A, B and C the histological effects were examined 24h after injection. The number of eosinophils amongst the exudate cells was counted. 100 mast cells of the perifocal region were examined in order to measure the percentage of degranulated cells. A smear differential count was performed using subepidermic parts of the Sephadex deposit. RESULTS Sephadex injection caused a very marked inflammatory reaction which was studied extensively. Similar results were obtained either using fresh Sephadex or washed Sephadex from inflammatory deposits. However, Sephadex from inflammatory deposits without wash induced only mild inflammatory reactions. All signs of acute inflammation were less pronounced. Hence, the phlogistic efficacy of Sephadex is reduced by the simultaneous presence of exudate. The most significant antiphlogistic effects were seen when exudate containing Sephadex from 3 days old inflammatory deposits was used. The significance of soluble parts of the exudate in these antiphlogistic effects is discussed."

Upon HS, various Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC)1 and PRC2 subunits, including CBX proteins, but also other chromatin regulators, are found to accumulate in the nucleolus. In parallel, binding of PRC1/2 to target genes is strongly reduced, coinciding with a dramatic loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 marks.

Epigenetic regulatory proteins support mammalian development, cancer, aging and tissue repair by controlling many cellular processes including stem cell self-renewal, lineage-commitment and senescence in both skeletal and non-skeletal tissues. We review here our knowledge of epigenetic regulatory protein complexes that support the formation of inaccessible heterochromatin and suppress expression of cell and tissue-type specific biomarkers during development. Maintenance and formation of heterochromatin critically depends on epigenetic regulators that recognize histone 3 lysine trimethylation at residues K9 and K27 (respectively, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3), which represent transcriptionally suppressive epigenetic marks. Three chromobox proteins (i.e., CBX1, CBX3 or CBX5) associated with the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) complex are methyl readers that interpret H3K9me3 marks which are mediated by H3K9 methyltransferases (i.e., SUV39H1 or SUV39H2). Other chromobox proteins (i.e., CBX2, CBX4, CBX6, CBX7 and CBX8) recognize H3K27me3, which is deposited by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2; a complex containing SUZ12, EED, RBAP46/48 and the methyl transferases EZH1 or EZH2).

The latter enzymes catalyze the subsequent mono-ubiquitination of lysine 119 in H2A (H2AK119ub). We discuss biological, cellular and molecular functions of CBX proteins and their physiological and pathological activities in non-skeletal cells and tissues in anticipation of new discoveries on novel roles for CBX proteins in bone formation and skeletal development."

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me) are repressive marks that silence gene expression. The M phase phosphoprotein (MPP8) associates with proteins involved in both DNA methylation and histone modifications, and therefore, is a potential candidate to mediate crosstalk between repressive epigenetic pathways. Here, by performing immunohistochemical analyses we demonstrate that MPP8 is expressed in the rodent testis, especially in spermatocytes, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis. Interestingly, we found that MPP8 physically interacts with PRC1 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1) components which are known to possess essential function in testis development by modulating monoubiquitination of Histone H2A (uH2A) and trimethylation of Histone H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27me3) residues. Knockdown analysis of MPP8 in HeLa cells resulted in derepression of a set of genes that are normally expressed in spermatogonia, spermatids and mature sperm, thereby indicating a role for this molecule in silencing testis-related genes in somatic cells. In addition, depletion of MPP8 in murine ES cells specifically induced expression of genes involved in mesoderm differentiation, such as Cdx2 and Brachyury even in the presence of LIF, which implicated that MPP8 might be required to repress differentiation associated genes during early development. Taken together, our results indicate that MPP8 could have a role for silencing genes that are associated with differentiation of the testis and the mesoderm by interacting with epigenetic repressors modules such as the PRC1 complex."

In eukaryotes, Suv39h H3K9 trimethyltransferases are required for pericentric heterochromatin formation and function. In early mouse preimplantation embryos, however, paternal pericentric heterochromatin lacks Suv39h-mediated H3K9me3 and downstream marks. Here we demonstrate Ezh2-independent targeting of maternally provided polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) components to paternal heterochromatin. In Suv39h2 maternally deficient zygotes, PRC1 also associates with maternal heterochromatin lacking H3K9me3, thereby revealing hierarchy between repressive pathways. In Rnf2 maternally deficient zygotes, the PRC1 complex is disrupted, and levels of pericentric major satellite transcripts are increased at the paternal but not the maternal genome. We conclude that in early embryos, Suv39h-mediated H3K9me3 constitutes the dominant maternal transgenerational signal for pericentric heterochromatin formation. In absence of this signal, PRC1 functions as the default repressive back-up mechanism. Parental epigenetic asymmetry, also observed along cleavage chromosomes, is resolved by the end of the 8-cell stage--concurrent with blastomere polarization--marking the end of the maternal-to-embryonic transition."

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins function as vital epigenetic regulators in various biological processes, including pluripotency, development, and carcinogenesis. PcG proteins form multicomponent complexes, and two major types of protein complexes have been identified in mammals to date, Polycomb Repressive Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). The PRC1 complexes are composed in a hierarchical manner in which the catalytic core, RING1A/B, exclusively interacts with one of six Polycomb group RING finger (PCGF) proteins. This association with specific PCGF proteins allows for PRC1 to be subdivided into six distinct groups, each with their own unique modes of action arising from the distinct set of associated proteins. Historically, PRC1 was considered to be a transcription repressor that deposited monoubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) and compacted local chromatin. More recently, there is increasing evidence that demonstrates the transcription activation role of PRC1. Moreover, studies on the higher-order chromatin structure have revealed a new function for PRC1 in mediating long-range interactions. This provides a different perspective regarding both the transcription activation and repression characteristics of PRC1. This review summarizes new advancements regarding the composition of mammalian PRC1 and accompanying explanations of how diverse PRC1-associated proteins participate in distinct transcription regulation mechanisms."

We have examined changes in the chromatin landscape during muscle differentiation by mapping the genome-wide location of ten key histone marks and transcription factors in mouse myoblasts and terminally differentiated myotubes, providing an exceptionally rich dataset that has enabled discovery of key epigenetic changes underlying myogenesis. Using this compendium, we focused on a well-known repressive mark, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation, and identified novel regulatory elements flanking the myogenin gene that function as a key differentiation-dependent switch during myogenesis. Next, we examined the role of Polycomb-mediated H3K27 methylation in gene repression by systematically ablating components of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes. Surprisingly, we found mechanistic differences between transient and permanent repression of muscle differentiation and lineage commitment genes and observed that the loss of PRC1 and PRC2 components produced opposing differentiation defects. These phenotypes illustrate striking differences as compared to embryonic stem cell differentiation and suggest that PRC1 and PRC2 do not operate sequentially in muscle cells. Our studies of PRC1 occupancy also suggested a \"fail-safe\" mechanism, whereby PRC1/Bmi1 concentrates at genes specifying nonmuscle lineages, helping to retain H3K27me3 in the face of declining Ezh2-mediated methyltransferase activity in differentiated cells."

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic virus that causes lifelong infection in humans by establishing latency after primary infection. Latent infection is a prerequisite for both persistent infection and the development of KSHV-associated cancers. While viral lytic genes are transiently expressed after primary infection, their expression is significantly restricted and concomitant with the binding of host epigenetic repressors Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) to lytic genes. PRC1 and PRC2 mediate the repressive histone marks H2AK119ub and H3K27me3, respectively, and maintain heterochromatin structure on KSHV lytic genes to inhibit their expression. In contrast to PRC2, little is known about the recruitment and role of PRC1 factors on the KSHV genome following de novo infection. Thus, the goal of this study was to examine the function of PRC1 factors in the establishment of KSHV latency. To address this question, we performed an shRNA screen targeting 7 different components of the canonical and non-canonical PRC1 complexes during primary KSHV infection. We found that RYBP, a main subunit of the non-canonical PRC1 complexes, is a potent repressor of KSHV lytic genes that can bind to the viral genome and inhibit lytic genes as early as 4 hours post infection. Surprisingly, our ChIP analyses showed that RYBP binds to lytic viral gene promoters in a PRC1-independent manner, does not affect PRC1 activity on the KSHV genome, and can reduce the level of histone marks associated with transcription elongation. Our data also suggest that RYBP can repress the viral lytic cycle after primary infection by inhibiting the transcription elongation of the lytic cycle inducer KSHV gene RTA. Based on our results we propose that RYBP uses a PRC1-independent mechanism to block KSHV RTA expression thereby promoting the establishment of KSHV latency following de novo infection."

Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) are transcriptional repressor complexes that play a fundamental role in epigenomic regulation and the cell-fate decision; these complexes are widely conserved in multicellular organisms. PRC1 is an E3 ubiquitin (ub) ligase that generates histone H2A ubiquitinated at lysine (K) 119 (H2AK119ub1), whereas PRC2 is a histone methyltransferase that specifically catalyzes tri-methylation of histone H3K27 (H3K27me3). Genome-wide analyses have confirmed that these two key epigenetic marks highly overlap across the genome and contribute to gene repression. We are now beginning to understand the molecular mechanisms that enable PRC1 and PRC2 to identify their target sites in the genome and communicate through feedback mechanisms to create Polycomb chromatin domains. Recently, it has become apparent that PRC1-induced H2AK119ub1 not only serves as a docking site for PRC2 but also affects the dynamics of the H3 tail, both of which enhance PRC2 activity, suggesting that trans-tail communication between H2A and H3 facilitates the formation of the Polycomb chromatin domain. In this review, we discuss the emerging principles that define how PRC1 and PRC2 establish the Polycomb chromatin domain and regulate gene expression in mammals."

Givosiran, an RNA interference-based therapeutic, is a recent addition to the limited treatment armamentarium for acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). As a small interfering RNA that is selectively taken up in the liver, both the mechanism and targeted delivery create a complex relationship between givosiran pharmacokinetics (PK) and the pharmacodynamic (PD) response. Using pooled data from phase I-III clinical trials of givosiran, we developed a semimechanistic PK/PD model to describe the relationship between predicted liver and RNA-induced silencing complex concentrations of givosiran and the associated reduction in synthesis of \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a toxic heme intermediate that accumulates in patients with AHP, contributing to disease pathogenesis. Model development included quantification of variability and evaluation of covariate effects. The final model was used to assess the adequacy of the recommended givosiran dosing regimen across demographic and clinical subgroups. The population PK/PD model adequately described the time course of urinary ALA reduction with various dosing regimens of givosiran, the interindividual variability across a wide range of givosiran doses (0.035-5 mg/kg), and the influence of patient characteristics. None of the covariates tested had a clinically relevant effect on PD response that would necessitate dose adjustment. For patients with AHP, including adults, adolescents, and patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment, the 2.5-mg/kg once monthly dosing regimen of givosiran results in clinically meaningful ALA lowering, reducing the risk for AHP attacks."

Introduction: 5-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) porphyria (ADP) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a profound deficiency in ALAD, the second enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, and acute neurovisceral attacks with abdominal pain and peripheral neuropathy. Hemin infusions are often effective in treating and preventing such attacks. Givosiran was recently approved for prevention of attacks of acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs), including ADP, but, to our knowledge, has not yet been applied in patients with this ultrarare disease. Case Description: We update the clinical course and report new treatment outcomes of a 32-year-old man with ADP managed for many years with weekly prophylactic hemin infusions. He has developed evidence of iron overload and was more recently found to have compensated cirrhosis. The patient was started on givosiran (Givlaari\u2122, Alnylam), a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic that is effective in preventing frequently recurring attacks of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common type of AHP. Discussion: No adverse effects of givosiran on the liver were observed in this patient with cirrhosis during 6 months of treatment with givosiran. The patient has continued to have recurrent attacks, with transient decreases in ALA levels only as related to treatment of his attacks with hemin. Our experience limited to one patient with ADP suggests that givosiran may not be effective in this type of acute porphyria. Since ADP may have an erythropoietic component, treatment with hydroxyurea, which was beneficial in one previous case, is planned."

BACKGROUND In patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), induction of delta aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) leads to haem precursor accumulation that may cause recurring acute attacks. In a recent phase III trial, givosiran significantly reduced the attack rate in severe AIP patients. Frequent adverse events were injection-site reaction, fatigue, nausea, chronic kidney disease and increased alanine aminotransferase. OBJECTIVES To describe the efficacy and safety of givosiran based on a personalized medical approach. METHODS We conducted a retrospective patient file study in 25 severe AIP patients treated with givosiran in France. We collected data on clinical and biochemical efficacy along with reports of adverse events. RESULTS Givosiran drastically reduced the attack rate in our cohort, as 96% were attack-free at the time of the study. The sustained efficacy of givosiran in most patients allowed us to personalize dosing frequency. In 42%, givosiran was only given when haem precursor levels were increasing. Our data suggest that givosiran is most effective when given early in the disease course. We confirmed a high prevalence of adverse events. One patient discontinued treatment due to acute pancreatitis. All patients had hyperhomocysteinemia, and all patients with initial homocysteine levels available showed an increase under treatment. In this context, one patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION The sustained effect of givosiran allowed a decrease in dosing frequency without compromising treatment efficacy. The high prevalence of adverse events emphasizes the importance of restricting the treatment to severe AIP and administering the minimum effective dose for each patient."

BACKGROUND & AIMS Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is caused by defects in hepatic heme biosynthesis, leading to disabling acute neurovisceral attacks and chronic symptoms. In ENVISION (NCT03338816), givosiran treatment for 6 months reduced attacks and other disease manifestations compared with placebo. Herein, we report data from the 36-month final analysis of ENVISION. METHODS Ninety-four patients with AHP (age \u226512 years) and recurrent attacks were randomized 1:1 to monthly double-blind subcutaneous givosiran 2.5 mg/kg (n = 48) or placebo (n = 46) for 6 months. In the open-label extension (OLE) period, 93 patients received givosiran 2.5 or 1.25 mg/kg for 6 months or more before transitioning to 2.5 mg/kg. Endpoints were exploratory unless otherwise noted. RESULTS During givosiran treatment, the median annualized attack rate (AAR) was 0.4. Through Month 36, annualized days of hemin use remained low in the continuous givosiran group (median, 0.0 to 0.4) and decreased in the placebo crossover group (16.2 to 0.4). At end of OLE, in the continuous givosiran and placebo crossover groups, 86% and 92%, respectively, had 0 attacks. AAR was lower than historical AAR in 98% and 100%, respectively (post hoc analysis), and there were 0 days of hemin use in 88% and 90%, respectively. The 12-item short-form health survey physical and mental component summary scores increased by 8.6 and 8.1, respectively (continuous givosiran) and 9.4 and 3.2, respectively (placebo crossover). EQ-5D health-related questionnaire scores increased by 18.9 (continuous givosiran) and 9.9 (placebo crossover). Lower urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen levels were sustained. Safety findings demonstrated a continued positive risk/benefit profile for givosiran. CONCLUSIONS Long-term monthly givosiran treatment provides sustained and continued improvement in clinical manifestations of AHP. CLINICALTRIALS GOV IDENTIFIER NCT03338816. EUDRACT NUMBER 2017-002432-17. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is a group of rare, chronic, multisystem disorders associated with overproduction and accumulation of neurotoxic heme intermediates (delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen), sometimes resulting in recurrent acute attacks and long-term complications. Givosiran, a small-interfering RNA that prevents accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, is approved for the treatment of AHP. These final 36-month results of ENVISION, a phase III study of givosiran in patients with AHP and recurrent attacks, show that long-term monthly treatment with givosiran leads to continuous and sustained reductions in annualized attack rate and use of hemin over time, as well as improved quality of life, with an acceptable safety profile. These results are important for physicians, patients, families, and caregivers who are grappling with this debilitating and potentially life-threatening disease with few effective and tolerable treatment options."

Givosiran is an N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated RNA interference therapeutic that targets 5'-aminolevulinate synthase 1 mRNA in the liver and is currently marketed for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria. Herein, nonclinical pharmacokinetics and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties of givosiran were characterized. Givosiran was completely absorbed after subcutaneous administration with relatively short plasma elimination half-life (t1/2; less than 4 hours). Plasma exposure increased approximately dose proportionally with no accumulation after repeat doses. Plasma protein binding was concentration dependent across all species tested and was around 90% at clinically relevant concentration in human. Givosiran predominantly distributed to the liver by asialoglycoprotein receptor-mediated uptake, and the t1/2 in the liver was significantly longer (\u223c1 week). Givosiran was metabolized by nucleases, not cytochrome P450 (P450) isozymes, across species with no human unique metabolites. Givosiran metabolized to form one primary active metabolite with the loss of one nucleotide from the 3' end of antisense strand, AS(N-1)3' givosiran, which was equipotent to givosiran. Renal and fecal excretion were minor routes of elimination of givosiran as approximately 10% and 16% of the dose was recovered intact in excreta of rats and monkeys, respectively. Givosiran is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of P450 isozymes, and it is not a substrate or inhibitor of uptake and most efflux transporters. Thus, givosiran has a low potential of mediating drug-drug interactions involving P450 isozymes and drug transporters. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Nonclinical pharmacokinetics and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of givosiran were characterized. Givosiran shows similar pharmacokinetics and ADME properties across rats and monkeys in vivo and across human and animal matrices in vitro. Subcutaneous administration results in adequate exposure of givosiran to the target organ (liver). These studies support the interpretation of toxicology studies, help characterize the disposition of givosiran in humans, and support the clinical use of givosiran for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria."

OBJECTIVE Since 1983, hemin has been FDA-approved for acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) attacks. In 2019, FDA approved givosiran for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria. The objective of this research was to estimate and compare the total cost of AIP-related healthcare for patients treated with hemin or givosiran. METHODS A microsimulation cost model was developed to estimate the annual economic impact of hemin versus givosiran treatment for patients with AIP from the U.S. healthcare payer perspective. Hemin treatment costs were calculated from the Hemin Shipment Data in which patients were defined as receiving acute attack treatment or prophylaxis treatment based on shipment patterns. Three separate hemin subpopulations were considered: one attack per year, multiple attacks per year, and hemin prophylaxis. Treatment costs for givosiran (with hemin for acute attacks) were simulated based on Phase III trial efficacy results applied to individual treatment histories in the Hemin Shipment Data. Other healthcare utilization was also considered. Outcomes were annualized and expenditures inflated to 2019. RESULTS For all patients with AIP, the average annual total cost of care with hemin was 78% lower (difference = $482,113; 95% CI=$373,638-$594,778) than the average annual total cost of care with givosiran. Average annual total cost of care with hemin was between 46% and 92% lower than givosiran for the three hemin subpopulations: one attack per year (difference = $545,219; 95% CI=$436,584-$657,239), multiple attacks per year (difference = $459,366; 95% CI=$350,291-$574,403), and hemin prophylaxis (difference = $311,950; 95% CI=$191,898-$435,893). Cost savings with hemin were robust to one-way and probabilistic sensitivity as well as scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS Hemin is expected to provide cost savings compared to givosiran for all AIP patients and subpopulations. Lower annual total costs of care with hemin range from $311,950 to $545,219 less depending on whether the patient uses hemin prophylactically or for acute treatment attacks."

The porphyrias are a group of disorders in which enzymatic deficiencies in heme production lead to toxic accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), which are involved in the neurovisceral attacks. Givosiran acts as a conventional siRNA to trigger RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing on delta-ALA synthase 1 (ALAS1), thus returning ALA and PBG metabolites to the physiological level to attenuate further neurotoxicity. Givosiran makes use of a new hepatic-delivery system that conjugates three GalNac (N-acetylgalactosamine) molecules to the siRNA passenger strand. GalNac binds to the liver asialoglycoprotein receptor, favoring the internalization of these GalNac-conjugated siRNAs into the hepatic cells. In a phase I study, subcutaneous monthly administration of givosiran 2.5 mg/kg reduced > 90% of ALA and PBG content. This siRNA is being analyzed in ENVISION (NCT03338816), a phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial. In preliminary results, givosiran achieved clinical endpoints for AIP, reducing urinary ALA levels, and presented a safety profile that enabled further drug development. The clinical performance of givosiran revealed that suppression of ALAS1 by GalNac-decorated siRNAs represents an additional approach for the treatment of patients with AIP that manifests recurrent acute neurovisceral attacks."

INTRODUCTION Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid formed in the intermediary metabolism of methionine. Amino acid metabolism and heme biosynthesis pathways are complexly intertwined. Plasma homocysteine elevation, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), has been reported in patients with acute hepatic porphyria (AHP), a family of rare genetic disorders caused by defects in hepatic heme biosynthesis. AREAS COVERED This article summarizes published case series in which givosiran, a subcutaneously administered small interfering RNA approved for AHP treatment, appeared to exacerbate dysregulated homocysteine metabolism in patients with AHP. A comprehensive exploratory analysis of ENVISION trial data demonstrated that on a population level, givosiran increased homocysteine but with wide interpatient variations, and there is no proof of correlations between HHcy and changes in efficacy or safety of givosiran. EXPERT OPINION The strong correlation and co-increase of homocysteine and methionine suggest that HHcy associated with givosiran is likely attributable to the impaired trans-sulfuration pathway catalyzed by cystathionine \u03b2-synthase, which uses vitamin B6 as a cofactor. Data-based consensus supports monitoring total plasma homocysteine and vitamin B6, B12, and folate levels before and during givosiran treatment; supplementing with pyridoxine/vitamin B6 in patients with homocysteine levels >100 \u03bcmol/L; and involving patients with homocysteine levels >30 \u03bcmol/L in decisions to supplement."

Although it has very beneficial effects in treating attacks of AIP, it comes with an extensive side effect profile that is not fully understood or studied. Hence, this novel drug model treatment's risk-benefit evaluation is still necessary.

The selected papers were screened based on eligibility criteria and filtered through quality appraisal tools, and 13 finalized research papers were included in the study. Of the 13 identified papers, three were clinical trials, and 10 were review articles. The selected papers all discussed the effectiveness and side effects of givosiran in acute and recurrent attacks of AIP. The research papers showed decreased rates of acute attacks of AIP with givosiran and terminating recurrent attacks. But there are certain non-serious side effects, like fatigue and nausea. Also, there are some severe side effects, like pain.

METHODS We conducted two identical, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month phase 3 trials (Elaris Uterine Fibroids 1 and 2 [UF-1 and UF-2]) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elagolix at a dose of 300 mg twice daily with hormonal \"add-back\" therapy (to replace reduced levels of endogenous hormones; in this case, estradiol, 1 mg, and norethindrone acetate, 0.5 mg, once daily) in women with fibroid-associated bleeding. An elagolix-alone group was included to assess the impact of add-back therapy on the hypoestrogenic effects of elagolix. The primary end point was menstrual blood loss of less than 80 ml during the final month of treatment and at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline to the final month; missing data were imputed with the use of multiple imputation. RESULTS A total of 412 women in UF-1 and 378 women in UF-2 underwent randomization, received elagolix or placebo, and were included in the analyses. Criteria for the primary end point were met in 68.5% of 206 women in UF-1 and in 76.5% of 189 women in UF-2 who received elagolix plus add-back therapy, as compared with 8.7% of 102 women and 10% of 94 women, respectively, who received placebo (P<0.001 for both trials). Among the women who received elagolix alone, the primary end point was met in 84.1% of 104 women in UF-1 and in 77% of 95 women in UF-2. Hot flushes (in both trials) and metrorrhagia (in UF-1) occurred significantly more commonly with elagolix plus add-back therapy than with placebo. Hypoestrogenic effects of elagolix, especially decreases in bone mineral density, were attenuated with add-back therapy. CONCLUSIONS Elagolix with add-back therapy was effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Elagolix is an orally active, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist approved for the management of endometriosis-associated pain and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Elagolix population pharmacokinetics and factors affecting elagolix exposure in healthy women and women with endometriosis have been reported previously. The purpose of this study was to extend the population pharmacokinetics model with additional modifications to incorporate data from phase III studies of elagolix with hormonal add-back therapy in women with uterine fibroids. METHODS Data from 13 clinical studies (a total of 2168 women) consisting of six phase I studies in healthy premenopausal women, four phase III studies in premenopausal women with endometriosis, and three phase III studies in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids were analyzed using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach. RESULTS Elagolix population pharmacokinetics was best described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption, lag time in absorption, and first-order elimination. Out of the covariates tested on elagolix apparent clearance, apparent volume of distribution, and/or relative bioavailability, only organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 genotype status and body weight had a statistically significant but no clinically meaningful effect on elagolix relative bioavailability and apparent volume of distribution, respectively. There were no clinically meaningful differences in elagolix population pharmacokinetics in healthy women or women with endometriosis or uterine fibroids. CONCLUSIONS Elagolix population pharmacokinetics modeling did not reveal any patient-related factors or clinical parameters that would require dose adjustments for the approved dosage of 300 mg twice daily with estradiol 1 mg /norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg daily, in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids.

OBJECTIVE To review data of elagolix plus estradiol and norethindrone acetate as add-back therapy for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids. DATA SOURCES Literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE and SCOPUS was performed using the search terms Oriahnn; elagolix, estradiol, norethindrone AND heavy menstrual bleeding; elagolix AND heavy menstrual bleeding; and gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist AND heavy menstrual bleeding between January 1, 1996, to March 2, 2021. Additional data were obtained from prescribing information, references of identified articles, and abstracts from scientific meetings. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION Clinical trials and articles discussing elagolix plus add-back therapy for the management of HMB in women with leiomyomas were included. DATA SYNTHESIS Phase 3 trials met the primary end point of menstrual blood loss (MBL) less than 80 mL at month 6 and at least a 50% reduction in MBL from baseline to the final month in 68.5% of women taking elagolix plus add-back therapy enrolled in UF-1 (8.7% placebo) and 76.5% of women in UF-2 (10% placebo). The most common adverse effects include hot flushes, nausea, headache, and night sweats. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE Women with symptomatic uterine fibroids can experience significant HMB resulting in distress, depression, and anxiety. Surgical intervention remains the most commonly recommended and chosen treatment. Elagolix plus add-back therapy is a nonsurgical, oral option. CONCLUSIONS Elagolix plus add-back therapy is effective in reducing menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. However, there are several warnings and precautions that must be considered."

BACKGROUND Uterine fibroids are one of the most common neoplasms found among women globally, with a prevalence of approximately 11 million women in the United States alone. The morbidity of this common disease is significant because it is the leading cause of hysterectomy and causes significant functional impairment for women of reproductive age. Factors including age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, menstrual blood loss, fibroid location, and uterine and fibroid volume influence the incidence of fibroids and severity of symptoms. Elagolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist that competitively inhibits pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor activity and suppresses the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland, resulting in dose-dependent suppression of ovarian sex hormones, follicular growth, and ovulation. In Elaris Uterine Fibroids 1 and Uterine Fibroids 2, 2 replicate multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies, treatment of premenopausal women with elagolix with hormonal add-back therapy demonstrated reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. OBJECTIVE This analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elagolix (300 mg twice a day) with add-back therapy (1 mg estradiol/0.5 mg norethindrone acetate once a day) in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in various subgroups of women over 6 months of treatment. STUDY DESIGN Data were pooled from Elaris Uterine Fibroid-1 and Uterine Fibroid-2 studies, which evaluated premenopausal women (18-51 years) with heavy menstrual bleeding (>80 mL menstrual blood loss per cycle, alkaline hematin methodology) and ultrasound-confirmed uterine fibroid diagnosis. Subgroups analyzed included age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, baseline menstrual blood loss, fibroid location, and uterine and primary fibroid volume (largest fibroid identified by ultrasound). The primary endpoint was the proportion of women with <80 mL menstrual blood loss during the final month and \u226550% menstrual blood loss reduction from baseline to final month. Secondary and other efficacy endpoints included mean change in menstrual blood loss from baseline to final month, amenorrhea, symptom severity, and health-related quality of life. Adverse events and other safety endpoints were monitored. RESULTS The overall pooled Elaris Uterine Fibroid-1 and Uterine Fibroid-2 population was typical of women with fibroids, with a mean age of 42.4 (standard deviation, 5.4) years and a mean body mass index of 33.6 (standard deviation, 7.3) kg/m2 and 67.6% of participants being black or African American women. A wide range of baseline uterine and fibroid volumes and menstrual blood loss were also represented in the overall pooled study population. In all subgroups, the proportion of responders to the primary endpoint, mean change in menstrual blood loss, amenorrhea, reduction in symptom severity, and improvement in health-related quality of life were clinically meaningfully greater for women who received elagolix with add-back therapy than those who received placebo and consistent with the overall pooled study population for the primary endpoint (72.2% vs 9.3%), mean change in menstrual blood loss (-172.5 mL vs -0.8 mL), amenorrhea (50.4% vs 4.5%), symptom severity (-37.1 vs -9.2), and health-related quality of life score (39.9 vs 8.9). Adverse events by subgroup were consistent with the overall pooled study population. CONCLUSION Elagolix with hormonal add-back therapy was effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids independent of age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, baseline menstrual blood loss, fibroid location, and uterine and primary fibroid volume."

Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common gynaecological benign disease. Even though often asymptomatic, UFs can worsen women's health and their quality of life, causing heavy bleeding and anaemia, pelvic discomfort and reduced fertility. Surgical treatment of UFs could be limited by its invasiveness and the desire to preserve fertility. Thus, effective medical therapies for the management of this condition are needed. Common drugs used to control bleeding, such us hormonal contraceptive or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, have no effect on fibroids volume. Among other more efficient treatments, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or the selective progesterone-receptor modulators have a non-neutral safety profile; thus, they are used for limited periods or for cyclic treatments. Elagolix is a potent, orally bioavailable, non-peptide GnRH antagonist that acts by a competitive block of the GnRH receptor. The biological effect is a dose-dependent inhibition of gonadal axis, without a total suppression of estradiol concentrations. For this reason, even though comparative studies between elagolix and GnRH agonists have not been performed, elagolix has been associated with a better profile of adverse events. Recently, elagolix received US FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe pain caused by endometriosis. Several clinical trials assessed the efficacy of elagolix for the treatment of heavy bleeding caused by UFs and the definitive results of Phase III studies are expected. Available data on elagolix and UFs showed that the drug, with or without low-dose hormone add-back therapy, is able to significantly reduce menstrual blood loss, lead to amenorrhea and improve haemoglobin concentrations in the majority of participants in comparison with placebo. The safety and tolerability profile appeared generally acceptable. The concomitant use of add-back therapy can prevent bone loss due to the hypoestrogenic effect and can improve safety during elagolix treatment."

DESIGN Pooled analysis of two identical, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month phase 3 trials (Elaris Uterine Fibroids [UF]-1 and UF-2). SETTING A total of 153 gynecological clinical care settings in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS Premenopausal women (18-51 years) with >80 mL of menstrual blood loss (MBL)/cycle and uterine fibroids with and without coexisting adenomyosis diagnosed by ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging at baseline. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized 1:1:2 to placebo, elagolix 300 mg twice daily alone, or elagolix 300 mg twice daily with estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg once daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was the proportion of women who had <80 mL of MBL during the final month and \u226550% reduction in MBL from baseline to the final month. Adverse events were monitored. RESULTS Of 786 women treated across the two trials, 16% (126 women) had coexisting adenomyosis. Among this subset, a significantly greater proportion of women who received elagolix with add-back therapy (77.1% [95% confidence interval, 66.2, 88.0]) met both primary endpoint criteria compared with women who received placebo (12.2% [95% confidence interval, 1.0, 23.4]). Adverse events most frequently reported in the elagolix with add-back adenomyosis subset were hot flushes (18.3%), nausea (11.7%), and night sweats (8.3%). CONCLUSIONS Elagolix with add-back therapy significantly reduced heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids and coexisting adenomyosis, suggesting that elagolix efficacy was not adversely affected by the presence of adenomyosis (Elaris UF-1 and UF-2 Clinical-Trials.gov numbers, NCT02654054 and NCT02691494)."

INTRODUCTION Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common benign tumor arising from myometrium of reproductive age women, with significant financial burden estimated in hundreds of billions of dollars. Unfortunately, there are limitations in available long-term treatment options. Thus, there is a large unmet need in the UF space for noninvasive therapeutics.

AIM Elagolix, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, was recently approved for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids (UF, Oriahnn) at a dose of 300 mg twice daily (BID) in combination with add-back therapy (oestradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg [E2/NETA] once daily) for 24 months use. The limited duration of treatment is related to elagolix dose- and duration-dependent decrease in oestrogen that is mechanistically linked to changes in bone mineral density (BMD). The work herein supported the extended treatment duration of 24 months. METHODS An integrated exposure-response and epidemiological modelling framework of elagolix effects on femoral neck BMD (FN-BMD), informed by real-world data and phase 3 clinical trials data, was developed to predict the time course and magnitude of changes in BMD and its relation to risk of bone fracture in women with UF. RESULTS Model results indicated that women treated with elagolix 300 mg BID + E2/NETA in the long term (ie, >24 months) may experience less than 1% loss in FN-BMD per year, relative to placebo. The exposure-response model simulations and clinical risk factors were used to estimate 10-year risk of fractures using the clinically validated Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). The impact of elagolix 300 mg BID + E2/NETA treatment on the 10-year risk of hip or major osteoporotic fractures estimated from the FRAX model was minimal compared to that of placebo. CONCLUSION The elagolix integrated exposure-BMD analysis and translation to fracture risk provided an interdisciplinary model-informed drug development framework for clinical benefit-risk evaluation and enabled approval of longer treatment duration to benefit the patient."

INTRODUCTION Uterine myomas represents a widespread gynecological disease of women in reproductive age. Although surgery remains the first choice for treating most patients, in the last years, new medical approaches have been considered in order to ameliorate heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) related to their presence.

Genes in nematode and ascidian genomes frequently occur in operons--multiple genes sharing a common promoter to generate a polycistronic primary transcript--and such genes comprise 15-20% of the coding genome for Caenorhabditis elegans and Ciona intestinalis. Recent work in nematodes has demonstrated that the identity of genes within operons is highly conserved among species and that the unifying feature of genes within operons is that they are expressed in germline tissue. However, it is generally unknown what processes are responsible for generating the distribution of operon sizes across the genome, which are composed of up to eight genes per operon. Here we investigate several models for operon evolution to better understand their abundance, distribution of sizes, and evolutionary dynamics over time. We find that birth-death models of operon evolution reasonably describe the relative abundance of operons of different sizes in the C. elegans and Ciona genomes and generate predictions about the number of monocistronic, nonoperon genes that likely participate in the birth-death process. This theory, and applications to C. elegans and Ciona, motivates several new and testable hypotheses about eukaryote operon evolution."

In 711 representative prokaryotic genomes, we have analyzed genomic neighborhoods of the genes that code the membrane subunit of sodium decarboxylases.

Here we describe a classification model based on usher phylogeny and genomic locus position to categorise the CU fimbrial types of E. coli.

Mapping biological pathways across microbial genomes is a highly important technique in functional studies of biological systems. Existing methods mainly rely on sequence-based orthologous gene mapping, which often leads to suboptimal mapping results because sequence-similarity information alone does not contain sufficient information for accurate identification of orthology relationship. Here we present an algorithm for pathway mapping across microbial genomes. The algorithm takes into account both sequence similarity and genomic structure information such as operons and regulons. One basic premise of our approach is that a microbial pathway could generally be decomposed into a few operons or regulons. We formulated the pathway-mapping problem to map genes across genomes to maximize their sequence similarity under the constraint that the mapped genes be grouped into a few operons, preferably coregulated in the target genome. We have developed an integer-programming algorithm for solving this constrained optimization problem and implemented the algorithm as a computer software program, p-map. We have tested p-map on a number of known homologous pathways. We conclude that using genomic structure information as constraints could greatly improve the pathway-mapping accuracy over methods that use sequence-similarity information alone."

Additionally, putative operons that are conserved in terms of known operons are also provided. The current version of our database contains about 2000 known operon information in more than 50 genomes and about 13 000 putative operons in more than 200 genomes. This system integrates four types of associations: genome context, gene co-expression obtained from microarray data, functional links in biological pathways and the conservation of gene order across the genomes. These associations are indicators of the genes that organize an operon, and the combination of these indicators allows us to predict more reliable operons. Furthermore, our system validates these predictions using known operon information obtained from the literature. This database integrates known literature-based information and genomic data. In addition, it provides an operon prediction tool, which make the system useful for both bioinformatics researchers and experimental biologists.

Genome-wide measurements of transcriptional activity in bacteria indicate that the transcription of successive genes is strongly correlated beyond the scale of operons. Here, we analyze hundreds of bacterial genomes to identify supra-operonic segments of genes that are proximal in a large number of genomes. We show that these synteny segments correspond to genomic units of strong transcriptional co-expression. Structurally, the segments contain operons with specific relative orientations (co-directional or divergent) and nucleoid-associated proteins are found to bind at their boundaries. Functionally, operons inside a same segment are highly co-expressed even in the apparent absence of regulatory factors at their promoter regions. Remote operons along DNA can also be co-expressed if their corresponding segments share a transcriptional or sigma factor, without requiring these factors to bind directly to the promoters of the operons. As evidence that these results apply across the bacterial kingdom, we demonstrate them both in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The underlying process that we propose involves only RNA-polymerases and DNA: it implies that the transcription of an operon mechanically enhances the transcription of adjacent operons. In support of a primary role of this regulation by facilitated co-transcription, we show that the transcription en bloc of successive operons as a result of transcriptional read-through is strongly and specifically enhanced in synteny segments. Finally, our analysis indicates that facilitated co-transcription may be evolutionary primitive and may apply beyond bacteria."

Although it is well known that there is no long range colinearity in gene order in bacterial genomes, it is thought that there are several regions that are under strong structural constraints during evolution, in which gene order is extremely conserved. One such region is the str locus, containing the S10-spc-alpha operons. These operons contain genes coding for ribosomal proteins and for a number of housekeeping genes. We compared the organisation of these gene clusters in 111 sequenced prokaryotic genomes (99 bacterial and 12 archaeal genomes). We also compared the organisation to the phylogeny based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences and the sequences of the ribosomal proteins L22, L16 and S14. Our data indicate that there is much variation in gene order and content in these gene clusters, both in bacterial as well as in archaeal genomes. Our data indicate that differential gene loss has occurred on multiple occasions during evolution. We also noted several discrepancies between phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and sequences of ribosomal proteins L16, L22 and S14, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer did play a significant role in the evolution of the S10-spc-alpha gene clusters."

BACKGROUND Spliced leader (SL) trans-splicing replaces the 5' end of pre-mRNAs with the spliced leader, an exon derived from a specialised non-coding RNA originating from elsewhere in the genome. This process is essential for resolving polycistronic pre-mRNAs produced by eukaryotic operons into monocistronic transcripts. SL trans-splicing and operons may have independently evolved multiple times throughout Eukarya, yet our understanding of these phenomena is limited to only a few well-characterised organisms, most notably C. elegans and trypanosomes. The primary barrier to systematic discovery and characterisation of SL trans-splicing and operons is the lack of computational tools for exploiting the surge of transcriptomic and genomic resources for a wide range of eukaryotes. RESULTS Here we present two novel pipelines that automate the discovery of SLs and the prediction of operons in eukaryotic genomes from RNA-Seq data. SLIDR assembles putative SLs from 5' read tails present after read alignment to a reference genome or transcriptome, which are then verified by interrogating corresponding SL RNA genes for sequence motifs expected in bona fide SL RNA molecules. SLOPPR identifies RNA-Seq reads that contain a given 5' SL sequence, quantifies genome-wide SL trans-splicing events and predicts operons via distinct patterns of SL trans-splicing events across adjacent genes. We tested both pipelines with organisms known to carry out SL trans-splicing and organise their genes into operons, and demonstrate that (1) SLIDR correctly detects expected SLs and often discovers novel SL variants; (2) SLOPPR correctly identifies functionally specialised SLs, correctly predicts known operons and detects plausible novel operons. CONCLUSIONS SLIDR and SLOPPR are flexible tools that will accelerate research into the evolutionary dynamics of SL trans-splicing and operons throughout Eukarya and improve gene discovery and annotation for a wide range of eukaryotic genomes. Both pipelines are implemented in Bash and R and are built upon readily available software commonly installed on most bioinformatics servers. Biological insight can be gleaned even from sparse, low-coverage datasets, implying that an untapped wealth of information can be retrieved from existing RNA-Seq datasets as well as from novel full-isoform sequencing protocols as they become more widely available."

In two identical phase III trials in adults with relapsing forms of MS, subcutaneous ofatumumab was more effective than oral teriflunomide in reducing the annualized relapse rate, as well as reducing MRI-detected lesion activity and limiting worsening of disability. Ofatumumab had a generally manageable tolerability profile; the most common adverse events (AEs) included nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. AEs of special interest (AESIs) included infections and injection-related reactions, which were generally manageable. There was no apparent association between changes in immunoglobulin G or M levels and the risk of serious infections after 3.5 years of ofatumumab treatment.

Particularly, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) such as rituximab or ocrelizumab have proven to be effective in treating various forms of MS. Ofatumumab, a second-generation anti-CD20 IgG1\u03ba fully human MAb, binds to a different, membrane-proximal epitope of CD20 compared with other anti-CD20 MAbs, thus ensuring a slower dissociation rate. This results in dose-dependent B-cell depletion mainly exerted through a mechanism of complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The repletion kinetic is faster than that of rituximab or ocrelizumab. Ofatumumab is the first approved drug for relapsing forms of MS that is administered via subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. Two phase II and two phase III clinical trials have shown that it is effective in reducing the annualized relapse rate and clinical disability worsening, as well as in suppressing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease activity. The safety profile of the drug has proven to be favorable, with good tolerability and low immunogenic risk. Moreover, the subcutaneous injection grants an easier way of administration.

BACKGROUND Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved for subcutaneous administration for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS), but intravenously administered ofatumumab has been investigated in a phase 2 trial and used off-label. The objective of the present study was to assess disease activity and side effects in relation to longer-term intravenous ofatumumab treatment of MS and related disorders. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of patients treated off-label with intravenous ofatumumab for MS, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) at the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Center. Data was retrieved from the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry and through medical chart review. RESULTS Fifty patients were identified with a median treatment duration of 2.2 years. Annualized relapse rate decreased from 1.03 at baseline to 0.38 during ofatumumab treatment. At 24 months, the probability of having experienced a relapse was 55% and confirmed disability worsening 7%. Frequency of infusion-related reactions was 86% during the first infusion and 42% during the last infusion. Six experienced infections requiring hospitalization. CONCLUSION Our data indicate a reduction of relapse frequency, stabilization of disability worsening and an acceptable safety profile, although we observed a higher frequency of infusion reactions compared to data from other intravenously administered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.

BACKGROUND Ofatumumab is a high-efficacy disease-modifying therapy (DMT) approved for first-line treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in Canada. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of ofatumumab from a Canadian healthcare system perspective. METHODS A Markov cohort model was run over 65 years using annual cycles, 1.5% annual discount rate, and 100% treatment discontinuation at 10 years. The British Columbia database informed natural history transition probabilities. Treatment efficacy for DMTs were sourced from a network meta-analysis. Clinical trial data were used to estimate probabilities for treatment-related adverse events. Health utilities and costs were obtained from Canadian sources (if available) and the literature. RESULTS Among first-line indicated therapies for RRMS, ofatumumab was dominant (more effective, lower costs) over teriflunomide, interferons, dimethyl fumarate, and ocrelizumab. Compared with glatiramer acetate and best supportive care, ofatumumab resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $24,189 Canadian dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and $28,014/QALY, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, ofatumumab had a 64.3% probability of being cost effective. Among second-line therapies (scenario analysis), ofatumumab dominated natalizumab and fingolimod and resulted in an ICER of $50,969 versus cladribine. CONCLUSIONS Ofatumumab is cost effective against all comparators and dominant against all currently approved and reimbursed first-line DMTs for RRMS, except glatiramer acetate."

Treatment-pattern data suggest that some patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) may not be receiving optimal treatment. A virtual meeting of ten expert Saudi neurologists, held on October 23, 2020, discussed unmet needs in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and the role of ofatumumab as a suitable treatment in the KSA. Multiple unmet needs were identified: poor quality of life, with high rates of depression and anxiety; a negative impact of MS on work ability; treatment choices that may compromise efficacy for safety or vice versa; inconvenient or complex dosage regimens; and limited access to patient education and support. Early use of highly effective disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) results in better patient outcomes than starting with less effective treatments and downstream escalation, but this strategy may be underutilized in the KSA. B cells are important in MS pathogenesis, and treatments targeting these may improve clinical outcomes. Ofatumumab differs from other B cell-depleting therapies, being a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to CD20 at a completely separate site from the epitope bound by ocrelizumab, and being administered by subcutaneous injection. When compared with teriflunomide in two randomized, phase 3 clinical trials in patients with RRMS, ofatumumab was associated with significant reductions in annualized relapse rates, rates of confirmed disability worsening, and active lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. The incidence of adverse events, including serious infections, was similar with the two treatments. Ofatumumab is a valuable first- or second-line treatment option for RRMS in the KSA, particularly for patients who would benefit from highly effective DMTs early in the disease course, and for those who prefer the convenience of self-injection. Future research will clarify the position of ofatumumab in RRMS treatment, and comparative cost data may support the broad inclusion of ofatumumab in formularies across the KSA."

BACKGROUND Several disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) reduce relapse rates and slow disease progression. RRMS DMTs have varying efficacy and administration routes; DMTs prescribed first may not be the most effective on relapses or disease progression. Here, we aimed to quantify the benefit of initiating ofatumumab, a high-efficacy DMT, earlier in the treatment pathway. METHODS Aggregate data from a real-world cohort of patients with RRMS, who were eligible for dimethyl fumarate (DMF) or ofatumumab treatment within the UK National Health Service (N = 615), were used to produce a simulated patient cohort. The cohort was tracked through a discrete event simulation (DES) model, based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), with a lifetime time horizon. Outcomes assessed were: mean number of relapses, time to wheelchair (EDSS \u22657), and time to death. Two modeling approaches were used. The first compared outcomes between two treatment sequences (base case: ofatumumab to natalizumab versus DMF to ofatumumab). The second incorporated a time-specific delay of 1-5 years for switching from DMF to ofatumumab; the difference in outcomes as a function of increasing delay to ofatumumab are reported. RESULTS Compared with delayed ofatumumab, fewer relapses and increased time to wheelchair were predicted for earlier ofatumumab in the treatment-sequence approach (mean relapses over the lifetime time horizon: 8.63 versus 9.00; time to wheelchair: 17.55 versus 16.60 years). Time to death was similar for both sequences. At Year 10, a numerically greater proportion of patients receiving earlier ofatumumab had mild disease (EDSS 0-3: 44.12% versus 40.06%). Greater differences, reflecting poorer outcomes, were predicted for relapses and time to wheelchair with increasing delays to ofatumumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS The DES model provided a means by which the magnitude of benefit associated with earlier ofatumumab initiation could be quantified; fewer relapses and a prolonged time to wheelchair were predicted."

The self-application offers a high degree of independence from intravenous forms of application with highly effective immunotherapy. In this study we recorded the patient-centered experience in 99 out of 127 patients who were adjusted to the drug by us. The aim was to investigate the tolerability and acceptance from the patient's perspective. METHODS Data collection was carried out using doctor documentation, questionnaires and telephone interviews. RESULTS The cohort consists of 127 patients. The patients received 2.8 (\u00b1 SD 1.7) pre-therapies. The mean duration of therapy with Ofatumumab was 9.8 months (\u00b1 SD 3.5). Structured data were collected from 99 patients. 23% of patients had no side effects during initial application. 19% rated the side effects as \"very mild\" and 18% as \"mild\". In addition to chills/fever (48%), headache (46%), limb pain (45%) and \"other symptoms\" (19%) also occurred. For subsequent injections, 72% of patients reported no side effects. 87% of patients found handling the medication \"very easy\". There was one relapse event during therapy. CONCLUSION Our study shows that Ofatumumab is well accepted and tolerated by patients. There was one relapse event during the observation period. The side effects are mild and occur during initial application. No increased tendency to infection could be observed. The data suggest that Ofatumumab is also an effective and safe treatment option for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in real-world use."

Incredibly, the majority of the clinical trials conducted have proven positive, demonstrating the importance of this signalling pathway in migraine. Unfortunately, a number of these molecules raised liver toxicity concerns when used daily for as little as 7 days resulting in their discontinuation. Despite the clear safety concerns, clinical trial data suggests that their intermittent use remains a viable and safe alternative, with 2 molecules remaining in clinical development (ubrogepant and rimegepant).

Thus we initiated a program aimed at the design and synthesis of small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists. High throughput screening led to the identification of (R)-Tyr-(S)-Lys dipeptide-like compounds that showed weak but unequivocal binding to the human CGRP receptor.

The development of several drugs that target the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) system has been a major breakthrough in the pharmacological management of migraine. These are divided into two major classes, antibodies which bind to the CGRP peptide, preventing it from activating CGRP receptors and receptor antagonists. Within the receptor antagonist class, there are two mechanisms of action, small molecule receptor antagonists and an antibody antagonist. This mini-review considers the pharmacology of these receptor targeted antagonist drugs at the CGRP receptor and closely related AMY1 receptor, at which CGRP may also act. The antagonists are most potent at the CGRP receptor but can also show antagonism of the AMY1 receptor. However, important data are missing and selectivity parameters cannot be provided for all antagonists. The clinical implications of AMY1 receptor antagonism are unknown, but we urge consideration of this receptor as a potential contributing factor to CGRP and antagonist drug actions.

Meanwhile, 1 small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonist (ubrogepant, MK-1602) is currently in phase 3 studies for the acute treatment of migraine. Two of these anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies are in clinical trials for cluster headache prevention as well. Several other small-molecular CGRP receptor antagonists are in earlier stages of development for acute migraine treatment or prevention. In this review, we will discuss the growing body of clinical trials studying CGRP-targeted therapies for migraine and cluster headache."

Migraine remains one of the most prevalent and disabling neurological disorders that often affects a person during their most productive years. Migraine afflicts approximately 11% of the adult population globally, causes substantial disability, which translates into lost productivity both at home and at work. Clearly there remains a need for new approaches to treat migraine and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists have the potential to be a major advance in antimigraine therapy. CGRP was first proposed to play a role in migraine pathophysiology a little over 20 years ago and today there is considerable evidence that CGRP plays a key role in the pathogenesis of migraine. CGRP is a 37 amino acid vasoactive neuropeptide largely expressed in sensory neurons. It was observed that plasma levels of CGRP were elevated during the headache phase of migraine and the levels were normalized concomitantly with pain relief. This observation, along with other evidence, suggested that CGRP receptor antagonists might represent a novel approach to migraine treatment. The advent of small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists has clearly demonstrated a clinical link between blocking the CGRP receptor and effectiveness in treating migraine. This review will highlight the biology of CGRP as it pertains to migraine; discuss the CGRP receptor; spotlight the development of CGRP receptor antagonists; and examine site of action."

The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor is composed of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR, a class B GPCR) and a single-pass membrane protein known as receptor activity modifying protein type 1 (RAMP1). The levels of the CGRP peptide increase during a migraine attack and infusion of CGRP can provoke a migraine attack. Consequently, there is much interest in inhibiting the actions of CGRP as a way to control migraine. Here we describe the development of small molecule antagonists designed to bind to the CGRP receptor to block its action by preventing binding of the CGRP peptide. We also describe the development of antibody drugs, designed to bind either to the CGRP receptor to block its action, or to bind directly to the CGRP peptide. The field has been very active, with one antibody drug approved and three antibody drugs in phase III clinical trial. Initial programs on the development CGRP antagonists were frustrated by liver toxicity but the current outlook is very promising with five small molecule antagonists in various stages of clinical trial."

OBJECTIVE To review the efficacy, safety, and cost of 3 newly approved agents-ubrogepant, lasmiditan, and rimegepant-representing 2 therapeutic classes, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist and serotonin 1F (5-HT1F) agonists, for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura. DATA SOURCES The Institute of Health US National Library of Medicine Clinical Trials, PubMed, and Cochrane databases were queried. Abstracts, journal articles, and other relevant sources published or present were reviewed. Search terms included the following: ubrogepant, MK-1602, Ubrelvy\u00ae, rimegepant, Nurtec\u00ae, BHV-3000, BMS-927711, lasmiditan, Reyvow\u00ae, LY573144. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Relevant English-language articles from June 30, 2010, to August 31, 2020, were evaluated and included in the narrative. DATA SYNTHESIS CGRP receptor antagonists, ubrogepant and rimegepant, achieved 2-hour pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome migraine symptom (MBS) at 2 hours. Both agents were well tolerated, with adverse effects similar to placebo. Lasmiditan, a 5-HT1F receptor antagonist, also improved 2-hour pain freedom and freedom from the MBS at 2 hours. Lasmiditan is associated with dizziness, paresthesia, somnolence, nausea, fatigue, and lethargy. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE Ubrogepant, rimegepant, and lasmiditan represent a new and exciting chapter in acute migraine therapy. To date, no head-to-head studies have compared these agents with the triptans. Ubrogepant and lasmiditan are effective in triptan nonresponders. None of the 3 agents is contraindicated in cardiovascular disease, unlike the triptans. CONCLUSIONS Based on available data, ubrogepant, rimegepant, and lasmiditan should be reserved as second-line therapy and may be safe in patients with cardiovascular risk. Lasmiditan's adverse effect profile may limit its use."

The most common adverse event associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy is cytokine release syndrome, which is characterized by fever, hypoxia, and hypotension in varying degrees of severity. In severe cases, cytokine release syndrome can result in life-threatening symptoms such as multi-organ failure. The widely accepted first-line therapy for cytokine release syndrome management is tocilizumab with or without corticosteroids, but there is very limited guidance on the proper management of patients unresponsive to this regimen. There are emerging strategies that target cytokine release syndrome through novel mechanisms, showing promise in treating or preventing severe cytokine release syndrome.

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Nine centers across the U.S. part of the chimeric antigen receptor-ICU initiative. PATIENTS Adult patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy who required ICU admission between November 2017 and May 2019. INTERVENTIONS Demographics, toxicities, specific interventions, and outcomes were collected. RESULTS One-hundred five patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel required ICU admission for cytokine release syndrome or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome during the study period. At the time of ICU admission, the majority of patients had grade 3-4 toxicities (66.7%); 15.2% had grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome and 64% grade 3-4 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. During ICU stay, cytokine release syndrome was observed in 77.1% patients and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome in 84.8% of patients; 61.9% patients experienced both toxicities. Seventy-nine percent of patients developed greater than or equal to grade 3 toxicities during ICU stay, however, need for vasopressors (18.1%), mechanical ventilation (10.5%), and dialysis (2.9%) was uncommon. Immune Effector Cell-Associated Encephalopathy score less than 3 (69.7%), seizures (20.2%), status epilepticus (5.7%), motor deficits (12.4%), and cerebral edema (7.9%) were more prevalent.

Introduction Injectable GnRH receptor agonists have been shown to improve cancer control when combined with radiotherapy. Prostate SBRT offers an abbreviated treatment course with comparable efficacy to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Relugolix is a new oral GnRH receptor antagonist which achieves rapid, sustained testosterone suppression. This prospective study sought to evaluate early testosterone suppression and PSA response following relugolix and SBRT for intermediate to high prostate cancer. Methods Relugolix was initiated at least 2 months prior to SBRT. Interventions to improve adherence were not utilized. PSA and total testosterone levels were obtained prior to and 1-4 months post SBRT. Profound castration was defined as serum testosterone \u2264 20 ng/dL. Early PSA nadir was defined as the lowest PSA value within 4 months of completion of SBRT. Per prior trials, we examined the percentage of patients who achieved PSA level of \u2264 0.5 ng/mL and \u2264 0.2 ng/mL during the first 4 months post SBRT. Results Between July 2021 and January 2023, 52 men were treated at Georgetown with relugolix (4-6 months) and SBRT (36.25-40 Gy in 5 fractions) per an institutional protocol (IRB 12-1775). Median age was 71 years. 26.9% of patients were African American and 28.8% were obese (BMI \u226530 kg/m2). The median pretreatment PSA was 9.1 ng/ml. 67% of patients were \u2265 Grade Group 3. 44 patients were intermediate- and 8 were high-risk. Patients initiated relugolix at a median of 3.6 months prior to SBRT with a median duration of 6.2 total months. 92.3% of patients achieved profound castration during relugolix treatment. Poor drug adherence was observed in 2 patients. A third patient chose to discontinue relugolix due to side effects. By post-SBRT month 4, 87.2% and 74.4% of patients achieved PSA levels \u2264 0.5 ng/ml and \u2264 0.2 ng/ml, respectively. Discussion Relugolix combined with SBRT allows for high rates of profound castration with low early PSA nadirs. We observed a 96% testosterone suppresion rate without the utilization of scheduled cues/reminders. This finding supports the notion that patients with localized prostate cancer can consistently and successfully follow an oral ADT protocol without daily reminders. Given relugolix's potential benefits over injectable GnRH receptor agonists, its usage may be preferred in specific patient populations (fear of needles, prior cardiovascular events). Future studies should focus on boundaries to adherence in specific underserved populations."

BACKGROUND Relugolix, an oral gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, was launched in Japan in 2019. Although there have been several studies on relugolix for leiomyomas, few have focused on submucosal leiomyomas. Submucosal leiomyomas cause bleeding more frequently than leiomyomas in other locations. There is only one case report described a patient treated for a submucosal leiomyoma with relugolix who developed severe hemorrhage. However, it remains unclear which characteristics of submucosal leiomyomas can lead to severe hemorrhage. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of submucosal leiomyomas that would cause severe hemorrhage when treated with relugolix. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed records of patients who underwent treatment for submucosal leiomyoma with relugolix (40 mg once daily for up to 6 months) in our institute between December 2019 and September 2021. We evaluated the clinical course and characteristics of submucosal leiomyoma in patients who developed severe hemorrhage. RESULTS A total of 17 patients were treated for submucosal leiomyoma with relugolix. Two patients developed severe hemorrhage and required emergent surgery and blood transfusions. Only those two of the 17 patients had a submucosal leiomyoma of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) type 0, which has a stalk. In the remaining 15 patients who had FIGO type 1 or 2 leiomyoma, hemorrhage did not occur. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that the use of relugolix for FIGO type 0 leiomyomas may be associated with a risk of hemorrhage. However, relugolix may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with FIGO type 1 or 2 leiomyomas."

BACKGROUND Recently, relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, has been considered an effective therapy for leiomyoma based on a phase 3 study in Japanese women. Leiomyoma combined with severe adenomyosis occasionally occurs in perimenopausal women; however, little information on the effectiveness of relugolix against severe adenomyosis exists. CASE PRESENTATION A 49-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with acute lower abdominal pain and abnormal uterine bleeding. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple leiomyomas with diffuse adenomyosis. Left hydrosalpinx was also observed. The patient refused surgical treatment and preferred oral relugolix. Since she experienced a hot flush and headache induced by relugolix, a traditional Japanese Kampo, kamishoyosan, was added to improve the side effects of relugolix. The patient was asymptomatic at the time of this report and experienced a significant shrinkage in uterine volume. Ultimately, she avoided hysterectomy as desired. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first report of co-occurring adenomyosis and leiomyoma, which was effectively treated with relugolix. Although the management of adverse side effects, including hot flush and headache by relugolix, has recently attracted attention and controversy, relugolix add-on therapy with kamishoyosan may help treat menopausal symptoms."

RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The cumulative incidence rate of testosterone recovery to >280 ng/dl at 90 d following drug discontinuation was significantly higher in the relugolix cohort (n = 137) than in the leuprolide acetate cohort (n = 47; 54% vs 3.2%; nominal p = 0.002). The median time to testosterone recovery was faster following relugolix treatment than with leuprolide acetate treatment (86.0 d vs 112.0 d). Compared with leuprolide acetate, more men treated with relugolix achieved \u226580% of baseline testosterone levels (39% vs 2.1%). Men \u226465 yr and those with baseline testosterone greater than the median had a higher incident rate of testosterone recovery. Adverse events were generally similar between treatment groups. One limitation is the short testosterone recovery follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Oral relugolix had faster and more complete recovery of testosterone to normal levels after treatment discontinuation than leuprolide acetate in a subset of men from the HERO study. The clinical implications of a faster testosterone recovery with relugolix may be significant for men being treated with androgen deprivation therapy and influence treatment decisions. PATIENT SUMMARY The male hormone testosterone is reduced during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Reduced testosterone levels cause side effects, impacting patient quality of life. When treatment is stopped, the side effects lessen over time as the levels of testosterone come back to pretreatment range (testosterone recovery). In this study, we found that the time to testosterone recovery was faster with relugolix than with leuprolide acetate."

PATIENT(S) OR ANIMALS None. January 5, 2022 Cell culture, protein analysis, immunohistochemistry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Production of GnRHR, COL1A1, FN1, VCAN, p-ERK, & ERK in treated/untreated leiomyoma cells. RESULTS 100 nM relugolix resulted in decreased production of COL1A1 at 24 (1.78 0.06-fold; P < .05) and 48 hours (1.92 0.14-fold; P < .05). Elagolix treatment resulted in a decrease in COL1A1 production at 24 but not 48 hours. In 2D and 3D, 100 nM relugolix resulted in decreased production of FN1 at 24 (1.7 \u00b1 0.07-fold; P < .05) and 48 hours (1.8 \u00b1 0.07-fold; P < .05); 100 nM elagolix resulted in decreased production of FN1 at 24 (1.7 \u00b1 0.14-fold; P < .05) and 48 hours (2.0 \u00b1 0.09-fold; P < .05). For cells treated with relugolix 100 nM resulted in decreased VCAN production by 48 hours (0.66 \u00b1 0.07-fold; P < .05). Contrary to our 3D data, 2D elagolix-treated cells demonstrated a decrease in VCAN production that was identified only at 24 hours. For GnRHR, no significant difference between the drugs was seen at 24 hours; at 48 hours production was only significantly decreased for relugolix (P < .05). Comparing both drugs, there was a significant difference in the concentration of p-ERK to ERK at 24 hours (P < .05); there was no difference by 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrated that treatment with either drug can 1) decrease ECM protein production and 2) inhibit the MAPK pathway."

Background: Relugolix is an oral GnRH receptor antagonist approved for men with advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix treatment has demonstrated an ability to lower testosterone to sustained castration levels in the phase 4 HERO study. Herein, we describe the results of a secondary endpoint of castration resistance-free survival (CRFS) during 48 weeks of treatment and profile patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Methods: Subjects were 2:1 randomized to either relugolix 120 mg orally once daily (after a single 360 mg loading dose) or 3-monthly injections of leuprolide for 48 weeks. CRFS, defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of confirmed prostate-specific antigen progression while castrated or death due to any reason was conducted in the metastatic disease population and the overall modified intention-to-treat (mITT) populations. Results: The CRFS analysis (mITT population) included 1074 men (relugolix: n = 717; leuprolide: n = 357) with advanced prostate cancer as well as 434 men (relugolix: n = 290; leuprolide: n = 144) with metastatic prostate cancer. In the metastatic disease populations, CRFS rates were 74.3% (95% CI: 68.6%, 79.2%) and 75.3% (95% CI: 66.7%, 81.9%) in the relugolix and leuprolide groups, respectively (hazard ratio: 1.03 [0.68, 1.57]; p = 0.84) at week 48. Results in the overall mITT population were similar to the metastatic population. No new safety findings were identified. Conclusions: In men with metastatic disease or in the overall population of the HERO study, CRFS assessed during the 48-week treatment with relugolix was not significantly different than standard-of-care leuprolide. Relugolix had similar efficacy for men with/without CRFS progression events."

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the foundation of treatment for patients with locally advanced, recurrent and metastatic prostate cancer, most commonly using luteinizing releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists. More recently, a new approach to ADT has emerged with the development of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists, which aim to overcome some of the potential adverse physiologic effects of LHRH agonists. This article focuses on the newest GnRH antagonist, relugolix - a once-daily treatment and the only oral GnRH antagonist that has now been approved for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. In phase II and III studies, relugolix achieved rapid and sustained castration without the testosterone surge associated with LHRH agonists, thus avoiding the potential clinical consequences of tumor flare and the necessity for concomitant anti-androgen therapy. Relugolix also achieved rapid testosterone recovery, which may potentially reduce ADT-related adverse events and offer opportunities for combination and intermittent therapy strategies. Cardiovascular safety is a particular concern in men with prostate cancer and ADT further increases cardiovascular risk: indeed, LHRH agonists are required to have a drug label warning about an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Data from the phase III HERO study demonstrate an improved cardiac safety profile for the GnRH antagonist relugolix compared with the LHRH agonist leuprolide, including a significantly reduced risk for a major adverse cardiovascular event. Taken together, the data indicate that relugolix may mitigate some of the cardiovascular concerns surrounding ADT and has the potential to become a new standard of care for men with prostate cancer. In summary, relugolix represents a novel and recently available prostate cancer management strategy, incorporating the mechanistic advantages of GnRH antagonists and the potential benefits of oral administration."

STUDY QUESTION What is the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment (up to 2 years) with relugolix combination therapy (CT) in women with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain? SUMMARY ANSWER For up to 2 years, treatment with relugolix CT improved menstrual and non-menstrual pain, dyspareunia, and function in women with endometriosis; after an initial decline of <1%, the mean bone mineral density (BMD) remained stable with continued treatment. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Endometriosis is a chronic condition characterized by symptoms of dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP), and dyspareunia, which have a substantial impact on the lives of affected women, their partners, and families. SPIRIT 1 and 2 were phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of once-daily relugolix CT (relugolix 40 mg, oestradiol 1 mg, norethisterone acetate 0.5 mg) in premenopausal women (age 18-50 years) with endometriosis and moderate-to-severe dysmenorrhea and NMPP. These trials demonstrated a significant improvement of dysmenorrhea, NMPP, and dyspareunia in women treated with relugolix CT, with minimal decline (<1%) in BMD versus placebo at 24 weeks. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Patients participating in this open-label, single-arm, long-term extension (LTE) study of the 24-week SPIRIT pivotal studies (SPIRIT 1 and 2) received up to an additional 80 weeks of once-daily oral relugolix CT treatment between May 2018 and January 2023. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Premenopausal women with confirmed endometriosis and moderate to severe dysmenorrhea and NMPP who completed the 24-week pivotal studies (SPIRIT 1 and 2 trials; Giudice et al., 2022) and who met all entry criteria were eligible to enrol. Two-year results were analysed by treatment group based on original randomization in pivotal studies: relugolix CT, delayed relugolix CT (relugolix 40 mg monotherapy for 12 weeks, followed by relugolix CT), or placebo\u2192relugolix CT (placebo for 24 weeks followed by relugolix CT). The primary endpoints of the LTE study were the proportion of dysmenorrhea and NMPP responders at Week 52 and Week 104/end-of-treatment (EOT). A responder was a participant who achieved a predefined, clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scores (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) for the specific pain type with no increase in analgesic use. The predefined clinically meaningful threshold for dysmenorrhea was 2.8 points and for NMPP was 2.1 points. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline in Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30) pain domain scores, a measure of the effects of endometriosis-associated pain on daily activities (function), NRS scores for dysmenorrhea, NMPP, dyspareunia, and overall pelvic pain, and analgesic/opioid use. Safety endpoints included adverse events and changes in BMD. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Of 1261 randomized patients, 1044 completed the pivotal studies, 802 enrolled in the LTE, 681 completed 52 weeks of treatment, and 501 completed 104 weeks of treatment. Demographics and baseline characteristics of the extension population were consistent with those of the original randomized population. Among patients randomized to relugolix CT at pivotal study baseline who continued in the LTE (N = 277), sustained improvements in endometriosis-associated pain were demonstrated through 104 weeks. The proportion of responders at Week 104/EOT for dysmenorrhea and NMPP was 84.8% and 75.8%, respectively. Decreases in dyspareunia and improvement in function assessed by EHP-30 pain domain were also sustained over 2 years. At Week 104/EOT, 91% of patients were opioid-free and 75% of patients were analgesic-free. Relugolix CT over 104 weeks was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with that observed over the first 24 weeks. After initial least squares mean BMD loss <1% at Week 24, BMD plateaued at Week 36 and was sustained for the duration of 104 weeks of treatment. Efficacy and safety results were generally consistent in women in the placebo\u2192relugolix CT and delayed relugolix CT groups. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The study was conducted as an open-label study without a control group over the 80 weeks of the extension period. Of the 802 patients who were enrolled in this LTE study, 681 patients (84.9%) and 501 patients (62.5%) of patients completed 52 and 104 weeks of treatment, respectively. In addition, there currently are no comparative data to other hormonal medications. Finally, a third (37.4%) of the study population terminated participation early. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS In conclusion, relugolix CT offers an additional option to help address an important unmet clinical need for effective, safe, and well-tolerated medical treatments for endometriosis that can be used longer-term, reducing the need for opioids and improving quality of life. The findings from this study may help support the care of women with endometriosis seeking longer-term effective medical management of their symptoms.

Based on the phase III HERO trial results, relugolix received Food and Drug Administration approval for adult patients with advanced prostate cancer (PCa). AREAS COVERED We provide an overview of the preclinical and clinical development of relugolix and its role in the current treatment landscape of PCa. EXPERT OPINION Relugolix leads to rapid inhibition of testicular production of testosterone and its rapid recovery upon discontinuation. In the HERO trial, relugolix was associated with a superior cardiovascular safety profile compared to GnRH agonists. These attributes make relugolix a promising therapy for patients with preexisting cardiovascular comorbidities, those pursuing intermittent androgen deprivation therapy, and those who desire rapid testosterone recovery during 'off-treatment' periods. In the HERO trial, very few patients received concomitant enzalutamide (n = 17, 2.7%) or docetaxel (n < 10, 1.3%). Safety of relugolix has not been established in combination with many androgen-receptor-axis targeted therapies (e.g. abiraterone, apalutamide), cabazitaxel, or lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan, which precludes its use in combination with these agents. In addition, being an oral drug, relugolix may also be associated with challenges of affordability, adherence, and compliance in this predominantly elderly population."

Recently published results (Nucleic Acids Res. 26, 5573-5580, 1998) suggest that the ribonuclease sensitivity of the DNA demethylation reaction may be an experimental artifact due to the possible tight binding of the nucleases to the methylated DNA substrate. Using an improved protocol we show for two different systems that demethylation of hemimethylated DNA is indeed sensitive to micrococcal nuclease, requires RNA and is not an experimental artifact. The purified 5-MeC-DNA glycosylase from chicken embryos and G8 mouse myoblasts was first incubated for 5 min at 37 degrees C with micrococcal nuclease in the presence of Ca2+ in the absence of the DNA substrate. Upon blocking the nuclease activity by the addition of 25 mM EGTA, the DNA demethylation reaction was initiated by adding the labeled hemimethylated DNA substrate to the reaction mixture. Under these conditions the DNA demethylation reaction was abolished. In parallel controls, where the purified 5-MeC-DNA glycosylase was pre-incubated at 37 degrees C with the nuclease, Ca2+ and EGTA or with the nuclease and EGTA, RNA was not degraded and no inhibition of the demethylation reaction was obtained. As has already been shown for chicken embryos, the loss of 5-MeC-DNA glycosylase activity from G8 myoblasts following nuclease treatment can also be restored by the addition of synthetic RNA complementary to the methylated strand of the substrate DNA. No reactivation of 5-MeC-DNA glycosylase is obtained by complementation with a random RNA sequence, the RNA sequence complementary to the non-methylated strand or DNA, thus ruling out a non-specific competition of the RNA for the binding of the nuclease to the labeled DNA substrate."

In many viral and nonviral eukaryotic systems, an inverse correlation has been observed between the extent of DNA methylation at 5'-C-C-G-G-3' sites and the extent of expression of specific genes as mRNA. The E2a region of adenovirus serotype 2 (Ad2) DNA encodes the Ad2-specific DNA binding protein required for viral DNA replication. In three lines of Ad2 transformed hamster cells (HE1, HE2, and HE3), multiple copies of the major part of the Ad2 genome persist in an integrated state. Cell lines HE2 and HE3 do not express the DNA-binding protein whereas line HE1 does so. It has been shown that, in cell line HE1, all 5'-C-C-G-G-3' (Hpa II/MspI) sites in the E2a region remain unmethylated. Conversely, in lines HE2 and HE3 lacking expression of the E2a region all Hpa II sites are methylated. The cloned E2a region of Ad2 DNA, the HindIII A fragment in pBR322, was methylated in vitro by using Hpa II DNA methyltransferase (5'-C-C*G-G-3') or was left unmethylated. In vitro methylation did not break or nick supercoiled circular DNA. Methylated or unmethylated DNA was then microinjected into the nuclei of Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the subsequent synthesis of Ad2-specific RNA was monitored. In vitro-methylated DNA remained in the methylated state for 24 hr on microinjection into nuclei of xenopus oocytes; unmethylated DNA remained unmethylated. When the injected DNA had been methylated by using Hpa H DNA methyltransferase, Ad2-specific RNA was not synthesized as late as 24 hr after microinjection. Unmethylated DNA was readily expressed into Ad2-specific RNA. As an internal control, unmethylated histone genes (h22 DNA) from sea urchin were microinjected together with methylated E2a DNA from Ad2. Ad2-specific RNA was not found; h22 DNA-specific RNA was readily detected. This finding ruled out nonspecific inhibitory effects in the methylated DNA preparation. Ir was also shown that transcription of the unmethylated HindIII A fragment of Ad2 DNA in Xenopus oocytes was initiated on the late promoter of the E2a region. The same promoter was used in productively infected KB cells. Methylation by BsuRI methylse (5'-G'G-C*C-3') did not inactivate the HindIII A fragment. These results provide evidence for the notion that methylated sequences at highly specific sites are involved in the regulation of gene expression. The actual nature of the regulatory signal is not yet understood."

Transposable elements (TEs) and their relics play major roles in genome evolution. However, mobilization of TEs is usually deleterious and strongly repressed. In plants and mammals, this repression is typically associated with DNA methylation, but the relationship between this epigenetic mark and TE sequences has not been investigated systematically. Here, we present an improved annotation of TE sequences and use it to analyze genome-wide DNA methylation maps obtained at single-nucleotide resolution in Arabidopsis. We show that although the majority of TE sequences are methylated, \u223c26% are not. Moreover, a significant fraction of TE sequences densely methylated at CG, CHG and CHH sites (where H = A, T or C) have no or few matching small interfering RNA (siRNAs) and are therefore unlikely to be targeted by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery. We provide evidence that these TE sequences acquire DNA methylation through spreading from adjacent siRNA-targeted regions. Further, we show that although both methylated and unmethylated TE sequences located in euchromatin tend to be more abundant closer to genes, this trend is least pronounced for methylated, siRNA-targeted TE sequences located 5' to genes. Based on these and other findings, we propose that spreading of DNA methylation through promoter regions explains at least in part the negative impact of siRNA-targeted TE sequences on neighboring gene expression."

Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) involving small interfering RNA (siRNA)-directed degradation of RNA transcripts and transcriptional silencing via DNA methylation have each been proposed as mechanisms of genome defence against invading nucleic acids, such as transposons and viruses. Furthermore, recent data from plants indicates that many transposons are silenced via a combination of the two mechanisms, and siRNAs can direct methylation of transposon sequences. We investigated the contribution of DNA methylation and the PTGS pathway to transposon control in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. We found that repression of the LINE1-like transposon, Tad, requires the Argonaute protein QDE2 and Dicer, each of which are required for transgene-induced PTGS (quelling) in N.crassa. Interestingly, unlike quelling, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase QDE1 and the RecQ DNA helicase QDE3 were not required for Tad control, suggesting the existence of specialized silencing pathways for diverse kinds of repetitive elements. In contrast, Tad elements were not significantly methylated and the DIM2 DNA methyltransferase, responsible for all known DNA methylation in Neurospora, had no effect on Tad control. Thus, an RNAi-related transposon silencing mechanism operates during the vegetative phase of N.crassa that is independent of DNA methylation, highlighting a major difference between this organism and other methylation-proficient species."

Chimeric oligonucleotides containing only O-methylated RNA residues on one strand or truncated hairpins lacking this 14-base segment did not participate in RecA-driven heteroduplex formation under these reaction conditions. The results presented here represent a first step in studying one facet of a strategy which uses O-methylated RNA residues as participants in homologous pairing events."

Unusual DNA/RNA structures of the C9orf72 repeat may participate in repeat expansions or pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Expanded repeats are CpG methylated with unknown consequences. Typically, quadruplex structures form by G-rich but not complementary C-rich strands. Using CD, UV and electrophoresis, we characterized the structures formed by (GGGGCC)8 and (GGCCCC)8 strands with and without 5-methylcytosine (5mCpG) or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmCpG) methylation. All strands formed heterogenous mixtures of structures, with features of quadruplexes (at pH 7.5, in K(+), Na(+) or Li(+)), but no feature typical of i-motifs. C-rich strands formed quadruplexes, likely stabilized by G\u2022C\u2022G\u2022C-tetrads and C\u2022C\u2022C\u2022C-tetrads. Unlike G\u2022G\u2022G\u2022G-tetrads, some G\u2022C\u2022G\u2022C-tetrad conformations do not require the N7-Guanine position, hence C9orf72 quadruplexes still formed when N7-deazaGuanine replace all Guanines. 5mCpG and 5hmCpG increased and decreased the thermal stability of these structures. hnRNPK, through band-shift analysis, bound C-rich but not G-rich strands, with a binding preference of unmethylated > 5hmCpG > 5mCpG, where methylated DNA-protein complexes were retained in the wells, distinct from unmethylated complexes. Our findings suggest that for C-rich sequences interspersed with G-residues, one must consider quadruplex formation and that methylation of quadruplexes may affect epigenetic processes."

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that maternal drug use or treatment for infertility is related to the occurrence of infant craniostenosis. DESIGN AND MATERIAL Maternal drug use and infertility treatment were studied in 398 cases of craniostenosis, identified from various Swedish health registers. Exposure information was ascertained in early pregnancy, and comparisons after adjustment for some confounders were made with all infants born. In order to validate some findings, data from the Central-East France Registry were studied for first trimester drug exposure in 235 infants, and use of ovarian stimulation in 315 infants with craniostenosis. RESULTS A statistically significant association between maternal use of anticonvulsants and infant craniostenosis was found (risk ratio [Swedish data], 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 7.94). With the Swedish data, an association was found with three nitrosatable drugs (risk ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 7.94), previously associated with the occurrence of craniostenosis, but this was based on only five exposures, and no such exposure occurred in the French data set. No association with subfertility (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 1.86) or infertility treatment (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 1.87) was found in the Swedish data and no statistically significant increase in the use of ovulation stimulation in the French data. CONCLUSIONS A strong association was found between the maternal use of anticonvulsants and infant craniostenosis, and a tentative association was found with the use of nitrofurantoin and two other nitrosatable drugs. There was no association with maternal subfertility or infertility treatment."

BACKGROUND Children with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis require rapid diagnosis for timely treatment. However, diagnostic delays may arise in settings with limited clinical resources. To address this issue, a simplified rule for diagnosing hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis has recently been proposed. We retrospectively applied this diagnostic rule in 2 infants to evaluate its generalizability to non-European children. CASE REPORT We present 2 cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, involving an Asian neonate with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis subsequent to echovirus infection and an African infant with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis caused by PRF1 mutation. Limitations on time and clinical resources prevented tissue biopsy and measurement of natural killer cell activity in either case at our center. The Asian case did not meet HLH-2004 criteria, but both cases met a rapid diagnostic rule on admission to our center. Both cases were transported to a tertiary center and diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis based on HLH-2004 criteria. Although treatment suppressed disease activity, the Asian neonate died of multiple-organ failure at age 6 months. The African infant remains in remission after allogenic cord blood stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS A simplified diagnostic rule for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may be useful for early diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in Asian and African children, especially in resource-limited clinical settings. Further investigation is required to elucidate whether early diagnosis with a simplified diagnostic rule improves treatment outcomes for children with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis."

BACKGROUND Adult hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a secondary immunopathologic phenomenon, mainly secondary to malignancy, infection, or autoimmune disorders. The performance of diagnostic criteria, studied in the pediatric population, is yet to be validated in the adult population. Some of the criteria include cytopenias and organomegaly that are inherent features to malignant processes, thus making the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis a challenge in patients with cancer. CASE PRESENTATION We describe the case of a 54-year-old white man with history of metastatic maxillary sinus adenoid cystic carcinoma who had severe liver injury and cytopenias with progressive clinical deterioration. We performed an evaluation, by flow cytometry, of the expression of surface markers in his natural killer cells that revealed remarkable abnormalities. His syndrome eventually fulfilled criteria for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and he received therapy with steroids with interval clinical improvement. Unfortunately, he refused further cytotoxic treatment and died 2 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS The conventional criteria for the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are suboptimal for adult patients with cancer resulting in delays in diagnosis and timely initiation of treatment. The diagnostic criteria have to be re-evaluated in patients with cancer; novel, easily available, and accurate diagnostic methods are needed."

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), also known as hemophagocytic syndrome (HS), is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition caused by uncontrolled proliferation of activated lymphocytes and histiocytes producing excessively proinflammatory cytokines. HLH can occur in all age groups. The most common syndromes are: prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly, unspecific neurological symptoms, pancytopenia, hemophagocytosis. Characteristic biochemical markers include high triglycerides, ferritin and decreased fibrinogen. There are two forms of HLH, primary (genetic) and acquired (secondary to infections, malignant and autoimmune diseases). Occurrence of both forms of HLH, acquired and genetic, is induced by infections, usually viral or by other triggering agents. Despite established diagnostic criteria many cases probably remain unrecognized. The main diagnostic difficulty is low specificity of symptoms, and in secondary form contemporary occurrence of symptoms of underlying disease. The aim of HLH treatment is to suppress hyperinflammation, what can be achieved by use of immunosuppressive/immunomodulating agents or cytostatics. Patients with genetic form of HLH require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

OBJECTIVE Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a hyperinflammatory syndrome that often requires critical care support and remains difficult to diagnose. These guidelines are meant to aid in the early recognition, diagnosis, supportive care, and treatment of patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in ICUs. DATA SOURCES The literature searches were performed with PubMed (MEDLINE). STUDY SELECTION Keywords and medical subject headings terms for literature search included \"macrophage activation syndrome,\" hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,\" and \"hemophagocytic syndrome.\" DATA EXTRACTION The Histiocyte Society developed these consensus recommendations on the basis of published reports and expert opinions with level of evidence provided for each recommendation. They were endorsed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine. DATA SYNTHESIS Testing for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis should be initiated promptly in all patients admitted to ICUs with an unexplained or disproportionate inflammatory response, especially those with rapid clinical deterioration. Meeting five or more of eight hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 2004 diagnostic criteria serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Early aggressive critical care interventions are often required to manage the multisystem organ failure associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Thorough investigation of the underlying triggers of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, including infections, malignancies, and autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases, is essential. Early steroid treatment is indicated for patients with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and is often valuable in patients with acquired hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (i.e., secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) without previous therapy, including macrophage activation syndrome (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to autoimmune/autoinflammatory disease) without persistent or relapsing disease. Steroid treatment should not be delayed, particularly if organ dysfunction is present. In patients with macrophage activation syndrome, whose disease does not sufficiently respond, interleukin-1 inhibition and/or cyclosporine A is recommended. In familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and severe, persistent, or relapsing secondary macrophage activation syndrome, the addition of prompt individualized, age-adjusted etoposide treatment is recommended. CONCLUSIONS Further studies are needed to determine optimal treatment for patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in ICUs, including the use of novel and adjunct therapies."

OBJECTIVES Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a syndrome of pathologic immune activation that shares similar clinical and laboratory phenotypes with severe sepsis. Recent studies led to better recognition of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis by clinicians, but no consensus exists on the criteria for high-risk patients. DESIGN We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis to analyze the risk factors associated with poor outcome. SETTING Pediatric intensive care and hematology units of three tertiary hospitals in Turkey. PARTICIPANTS Fifty-two children with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS There were a total of 52 children meeting the diagnostic criteria of Histiocytic Society. Of them, 28 (54%) had a primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Mutation studies were performed in 18 of 28 patients (65%). Fourteen of them had PRF1, STX11, STXBP2, and UNC13D mutations, and four had Rab27a and LYST mutations. The remaining 24 patients (46%) were defined as having secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Twenty-one of them had infection-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and three had lysinuric protein intolerance. The mortality rate was significantly higher in primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (64%) than in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (16%) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences for survival rate between hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 94 (44%) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 2004 (64%) protocols (p > 0.05). Age below 2 years, hyperferritinemia, thrombocytopenia, high disseminated intravascular coagulation score at diagnosis, and no clinical response at 2 weeks of treatment were independent prognostic factors for poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that disseminated intravascular coagulation score greater than or equal to 5 can be used in the definition of high-risk patients. Early recognition of poor risk factors has important prognostic and therapeutic implications."

OBJECTIVES To assess whether critically ill hematologic patients without diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may have features mimicking hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis according to both diagnostic scores. DESIGN A retrospective case-control study. SETTING Hemophagocytic syndrome diagnosis was standardized and based on a consensual diagnosis by at least two experts of a university hospital which is a reference center for hemophagocytic syndrome. PATIENTS Cases (hemophagocytic syndrome+) consisted in a group of consecutive patients (n = 150) admitted in our ICU between 2007 and 2018. Control group (hemophagocytic syndrome-) consisted in patients included in a prospective multicenter cohort of hematologic patients in whom three independent experts ruled out the diagnosis of hemophagocytic syndrome (n = 1011). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Overall, 1,161 patients were included. Hospital mortality was 45.8% in hemophagocytic syndrome- patients (n = 66) and 38.8% in control patients (n = 392; p = 0.126). Median HScore was 235 (205-262) in hemophagocytic syndrome+ and 42 (18-62) in hemophagocytic syndrome- patients (p < 0.001); number of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis criteria was 4 (4-5) vs 1 (0-1), respectively (p < 0.001). Diagnostic performances of both scores were excellent with area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99-0.99) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99-0.99) for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and HScore, respectively. After propensity score matching (n = 144 \u00d7 2), the median HScore was 234 (205-262) in hemophagocytic syndrome+ patients versus 49 (18-71) in hemophagocytic syndrome- patients (p < 0.001). Median number of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis criteria was 4 (4-5) in hemophagocytic syndrome+ and 1 (0-1) in hemophagocytic syndrome- patients (p < 0.001). Area under receiver operating characteristic curve was then of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99) for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis criteria and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99-1) for HScore. CONCLUSIONS In ICU patients, several conditions share some similarities with hemophagocytic syndrome, explaining the poor predictive value of isolated biological markers such as ferritin level. Despite these potential confounding factors, our study suggests HScore and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis criteria to be highly discriminant identifying hemophagocytic syndrome in critically ill patients."

BACKGROUND We sought to screen for clinical and laboratory features of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis among pediatric patients with severe sepsis. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study that analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of 70 pediatric patients who died of severe sepsis. Medical records were revised for the presence of fever, splenomegaly, pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. Soluble CD25 was measured in stored samples. RESULTS Patients' ages ranged between 0.5 and 11 years with median (interquartile range) 2 (1-5). All patients had fever (\u226538.5 \u00b0C) and pancytopenia, 58 (82.9%) hepatosplenomegaly, 36 (51.4%) lymphadenopathy, 37 (52.9%) had ferritin >500 ng/ml, 20 (28.6%) had fibrinogen <1.5 mg/ml, 14 (20%) had fasting triglycerides >264 mg/dl while 5 (7.1%) had soluble CD25 >2400 U/ml. Twenty-five (35.7%) patients fulfilled at least 5/6 of the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-2004 diagnostic criteria. Multivariate backward binary logistic regression analysis revealed lymphadenopathy as an independent predictor for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis criteria fulfilment with odds ratio of 23.9. Fibrinogen had the best performance in discriminating hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis fulfilling from non-fulfilling groups (cut-off value: <1.8 mg/ml), followed by ferritin/erythrocyte sedimentation rate ratio (cut-off value: >17). CONCLUSION There is a significant clinical and laboratory overlap between hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and severe sepsis, making the syndromes difficult to distinguish.

Whether TDP-43 pathology elicits disease-modifying immune responses in ALS remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that TDP-43 pathology is internalized by antigen presenting cells, causes vesicle rupture, and leads to innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Using a multiplex imaging platform, we observed interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells near TDP-43 pathological lesions in ALS brain. We used a mass cytometry-based whole-blood stimulation assay to provide evidence that ALS patient peripheral immune cells exhibit responses to TDP-43 aggregates. Taken together, this study provides a novel link between TDP-43 pathology and ALS immune dysfunction, and further highlights the translational and diagnostic implications of monitoring and manipulating the ALS immune response."

Investigations into the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have provided significant insight into the disease. At the cellular level, ALS and FTD are classified as proteinopathies, which is motor neuron degeneration and death characterized by pathological protein aggregates or dysregulated proteostasis. At both the clinical and molecular level there are common signaling pathways dysregulated across the ALS and FTD spectrum (ALS/FTD). Sequestosome-1/p62 is a multifunctional scaffold protein with roles in several signaling pathways including proteostasis, protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy, the antioxidant response, inflammatory response, and apoptosis. Notably these pathways are dysregulated in ALS and FTD. Mutations in the functional domains of p62 provide links to the pathogenetic mechanisms of p62 and dyshomeostasis of p62 levels is noted in several types of ALS and FTD. We present here that the dysregulated ALS and FTD signaling pathways are linked, with p62 converging the molecular mechanisms. This review summarizes the current literature on the complex role of p62 in the pathogenesis across the ALS/FTD spectrum. The focus is on the underlying convergent molecular mechanisms of ALS and FTD-associated proteins and pathways that dysregulate p62 levels or are dysregulated by p62, with emphasis on how p62 is implicated across the ALS/FTD spectrum."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Neuroinflammation is an important mediator of the pathogenesis of disease in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Genetic mutations such as C9orf72 have begun to define the numerous cell autonomous pathways that initiate motor neuron injury. Yet, it is the signalling to surrounding glia and peripherally derived immune cells that initiates the noncell autonomous inflammatory process and promotes self-propagating motor neuron cell death. The purpose of this review is to explore the systemic immune/inflammatory contributions to the pathogenesis of ALS: what are the peripheral pro-inflammatory signatures, what initiates their presence and do they represent potential therapeutic targets. RECENT FINDINGS In ALS, motor neuron cell death is initiated by multiple cell autonomous pathways leading to misfolded proteins, oxidative stress, altered mitochondria, impaired autophagy and altered RNA metabolism, which collectively promote noncell autonomous inflammatory reactivity. The resulting disease is characterized by activated microglia and astrocytes as well as peripherally derived pro-inflammatory innate and adaptive immune cells. In this unrelenting disorder, circulating blood monocytes and natural killer cells are pro-inflammatory. Furthermore, regulatory T lymphocytes are dysfunctional, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins are elevated. SUMMARY The collective dysregulation of cells and cytokines in patients with ALS accurately reflect increased disease burdens, more rapid progression rates and reduced survival times, reinforcing the concept of ALS as a disorder with extensive systemic pro-inflammatory responses. These increased systemic pro-inflammatory immune constituents provide potentially meaningful therapeutic targets."

However, there is also strong evidence for a neuroprotective immune response in ALS. Emerging evidence also reveals changes in the peripheral adaptive immune responses as well as alterations in the blood brain barrier that may aid traffic of lymphocytes and antibodies into the CNS. Understanding the triggers of neuroinflammation is key to controlling neuronal loss. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding the roles of non-neuronal cells as well as the innate and adaptive immune responses in ALS. Existing ALS animal models, in particular genetic rodent models, are very useful to study the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neurodegenerative disease. Cell damage in ALS is the result of many different, largely unknown, pathogenetic mechanisms. Astrocytes and microglial cells play a critical role also for their ability to enhance a deranged inflammatory response. Excitotoxicity, due to excessive glutamate levels and increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, has also been proposed to play a key role in ALS pathogenesis/progression. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) behave as key second messengers for multiple receptor/ligand interactions. ROS-dependent regulatory networks are usually mediated by peroxides. Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) physiologically mediates intracellular peroxide generation. About 10% of ALS subjects show a familial disease associated with different gain-of-function SOD1 mutations. The occurrence of sporadic ALS, not clearly associated with SOD1 defects, has been also described. SOD1-dependent pathways have been involved in neuron functional network as well as in immune-response regulation. Both, neuron depolarization and antigen-dependent T-cell activation mediate SOD1 exocytosis, inducing increased interaction of the enzyme with a complex molecular network involved in the regulation of neuron functional activity and immune response. Here, alteration of SOD1-dependent pathways mediating increased intracellular Ca2+ levels, altered mitochondria functions and defective inflammatory process regulation have been proposed to be relevant for ALS pathogenesis/progression."

In recent years, this microglial reaction to motor neuron injury, in particular, and the innate immune response, in general, has been implicated in the progression of the disease, in mouse models of ALS. The mechanisms by which microglial cells influence motor neuron death in ALS are still largely unknown. Microglial activation increases over the course of the disease and is associated with an alteration in the production of toxic factors and also neurotrophic factors.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by damage of motor neurons. Recent reports indicate that inflammatory responses occurring within the central nervous system contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS. We aimed to investigate disease-specific gene expression associated with neuroinflammation by conducting transcriptome analysis on fibroblasts from three patients with sporadic ALS and three normal controls. Several pathways were found to be upregulated in patients with ALS, among which the toll-like receptor (TLR) and NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways are related to the immune response. Genes-toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP), mitogen-activated protein kinase 9 (MAPK9), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1)-related to these two pathways were validated using western blotting. This study validated the genes that are associated with TLR and NLR signaling pathways from different types of patient-derived cells. Not only fibroblasts but also induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and neural rosettes from the same origins showed similar expression patterns. Furthermore, expression of TOLLIP, a regulator of TLR signaling pathway, decreased with cellular aging as judged by changes in its expression through multiple passages. TOLLIP expression was downregulated in ALS cells under conditions of inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide. Our data suggest that the TLR and NLR signaling pathways are involved in pathological innate immunity and neuroinflammation associated with ALS and that TOLLIP, MAPK9, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and CXCL1 play a role in ALS-specific immune responses. Moreover, changes of TOLLIP expression might be associated with progression of ALS."

BACKGROUND Systemic inflammation has been proposed as a relevant mechanism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Still, comprehensive data on ALS patients' innate and adaptive immune responses and their effect on the clinical phenotype are lacking. Here, we investigate systemic immunity in a population-based ALS cohort using readily available hematological indexes. METHODS We collected clinical data and the complete blood count (CBC) at diagnosis in ALS patients from the Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta Register for ALS (PARALS) from 2007 to 2019. Leukocytes populations, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic-immune-inflammation index (SII), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) were derived from CBC. All variables were analyzed for association with clinical features in the entire cohort and then in sex- and age-based subgroups. RESULTS Neutrophils (P = 0.001) and markers of increased innate immunity (NLR, P = 0.008 and SII, P = 0.006) were associated with a faster disease progression. Similarly, elevated innate immunity correlated with worse pulmonary function and shorter survival. The prognosis in women also correlated with low lymphocytes (P = 0.045) and a decreased LMR (P = 0.013). ALS patients with cognitive impairment exhibited lower monocytes (P = 0.0415). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The dysregulation of the systemic immune system plays a multifaceted role in ALS. More specifically, an elevated innate immune response is associated with faster progression and reduced survival. Conversely, ALS patients with cognitive impairment showed a reduction in monocyte count. Additionally, immune response varied according to sex and age, thus suggesting that involved immune pathways are patient specific. Further studies will help translate those findings into clinical practice or targeted treatments."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss of motor neurons both in the brain and spinal cord, which dramatically reduces life expectancy. ALS occurs either in familial ALS or, more frequently, in sporadic ALS forms. Several mechanisms have been postulated to underlie motor neuron death. In the present paper, starting from some of the genes related to familial ALS, we overview and discuss their potential role in modifying of the physiological clearance of altered proteins and organelles in motor neurons. Special emphasis is placed on the role of autophagy, which seems to prevail as a protein clearing system over other multienzymatic pathways such as the proteasome within motor neurons. The evidence which links an altered autophagy to the onset of motor neuron death proposes that this biochemical pathway might represent a final common mechanism underlying both inherited and sporadic forms of ALS. In light of these findings we also analyze the potential significance of a novel association between ALS, altered autophagy, and mutations of nuclear proteins such as TAR-DNA-Binding Protein 43 and fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma. Such an association appears to be critical since it is now well demonstrated that all sporadic and most familiar forms of ALS are characterized by altered deposition and mislocalization of TAR-DNA-Binding Protein 43. These novel insights into the pathogenesis of ALS may lead to the identification of novel strategies to promote motor neuron survival."

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate whether pulsations measured in the brain correspond to those measured in lumbar space, and subsequently whether lumbar punctures could replace invasive recordings. METHODS In ten patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus, simultaneous recordings of the intracranial pressure (ICP; intraparenchymal) and lumbar pressure (LP; cerebrospinal fluid pressure) were performed. During registration, pressure was altered between resting pressure and 45 mmHg using an infusion test. Data were analyzed regarding pulsations (i.e., amplitudes). Also, the pressure sensors were compared in a bench test. RESULTS The correlation between intracranial and lumbar amplitudes was 0.98. At resting pressure, and moderately elevated ICP, intracranial pulse amplitudes exceeded that of lumbar space with about 0.9 mmHg. At the highest ICP, the difference changed to -0.2 mmHg. The bench test showed that the agreement of sensor readings was good at resting pressure, but reduced at higher amplitudes. CONCLUSIONS Compared to intracranial registrations, amplitudes measured through lumbar puncture were slightly attenuated. The bench test showed that differences were not attributable to dissimilarities of the sensor systems. A lumbar pressure amplitude measurement is an alternative to ICP recording, but the thresholds for what should be interpreted as elevated amplitudes need to be adjusted."

All four patients had survived a severe neurological disease (encephalitis, subdural haematoma, stroke) which required craniectomy to control raised ICP.

One patient developed herniation a second time while in the typical 30 degrees upright position. After craniectomy, transtentorial herniation is possible even in the absence of increased ICP. It is related to a negative gradient between atmospheric and intracranial pressure, which is enhanced by changes in the CSF compartment following lumbar puncture.

BACKGROUND Choroidal folds may be caused by several underlying ocular and orbital diseases; they are classified as idiopathic when no obvious cause is found. The objective of this study was to determine whether acquired choroidal folds are associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. METHODS In this observational case series, three patients with normal fundus examination later developed choroidal folds. They underwent complete ocular examination, B-scan ultrasonography, fluorescein angiography, optic coherent tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging. A neurological consultation, lumbar puncture and measurement of opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were also obtained for all patients. RESULTS Three patients with previously normal ocular fundus developed choroidal folds, and optic nerve subarachnoid space enlargement was seen on B-scan. Clinical and radiological evaluations identified elevation of intracranial pressure, and biochemical analysis of CSF was normal, suggesting a diagnosis of pseudotumour cerebri, which was later confirmed. The first patient developed choroidal folds in one eye first, and 4 years later in the fellow eye. The second patient presented with bilateral optic disk swelling secondary to intracranial hypertension. After treatment, which lowered CSF pressure, bilateral choroidal folds were identified by OCT, fluorescein angiography and ocular fundus photograph. The third patient also developed choroidal folds in one eye, but his fellow eye was difficult to evaluate due to a chorioretinitis scar on the macula. OCT identified choroidal folds in all three patients and in the second patient, it also revealed retinal nerve fiber layer damage. CONCLUSIONS Acquired choroidal folds and optic nerve subarachnoid space enlargement may be signs of idiopathic intracranial pressure elevation. Nevertheless, this diagnosis should be confirmed by lumbar puncture. Comprehensive imaging studies should be performed to rule out expanding tumors. The lower CSF pressure in our first two patients suggests that choroidal folds or optic disk swelling may depend on the level of intracranial pressure and may be points in a continuum of clinical presentations."

This study evaluated displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE), an MR imaging technique highly sensitive to brain motion, as a noninvasive means of assessing intracranial pressure status. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine patients with suspected elevated intracranial pressure and 9 healthy control subjects were included in this prospective study. Controls underwent DENSE MR imaging through the midsagittal brain. Patients underwent DENSE MR imaging followed immediately by lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement, CSF removal, closing pressure measurement, and immediate repeat DENSE MR imaging. Phase-reconstructed images were processed producing displacement maps, and pontine displacement was calculated. Patient data were analyzed to determine the effects of measured pressure on pontine displacement. Patient and control data were analyzed to assess the effects of clinical status (pre-lumbar puncture, post-lumbar puncture, or control) on pontine displacement. RESULTS Patients demonstrated imaging findings suggesting chronically elevated intracranial pressure, whereas healthy control volunteers demonstrated no imaging abnormalities. All patients had elevated opening pressure (median, 36.0 cm water), decreased by the removal of CSF to a median closing pressure of 17.0 cm water. Patients pre-lumbar puncture had significantly smaller pontine displacement than they did post-lumbar puncture after CSF pressure reduction (P = .001) and compared with controls (P = .01).

Eukaryotic cells contain numerous helicases that can unfold G-quadruplexes 3 . The molecular basis of the recognition and unfolding of G-quadruplexes by helicases remains poorly understood. DHX36 (also known as RHAU and G4R1), a member of the DEAH/RHA family of helicases, binds both DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes with extremely high affinity4-6, is consistently found bound to G-quadruplexes in cells7,8, and is a major source of G-quadruplex unfolding activity in HeLa cell lysates 6 . DHX36 is a multi-functional helicase that has been implicated in G-quadruplex-mediated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and is essential for heart development, haematopoiesis, and embryogenesis in mice9-12. Here we report the co-crystal structure of bovine DHX36 bound to a DNA with a G-quadruplex and a 3' single-stranded DNA segment. We show that the N-terminal DHX36-specific motif folds into a DNA-binding-induced \u03b1-helix that, together with the OB-fold-like subdomain, selectively binds parallel G-quadruplexes. Comparison with unliganded and ATP-analogue-bound DHX36 structures, together with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, suggests that G-quadruplex binding alone induces rearrangements of the helicase core; by pulling on the single-stranded DNA tail, these rearrangements drive G-quadruplex unfolding one residue at a time."

The DEAH/RHA helicase DHX36 has been linked to cellular RNA and DNA quadruplex structures and to AU-rich RNA elements. In vitro, DHX36 remodels DNA and RNA quadruplex structures and unwinds DNA duplexes in an ATP-dependent manner. DHX36 contains the superfamily 2 helicase core and several auxiliary domains that are conserved in orthologs of the enzyme. The role of these auxiliary domains for the enzymatic function of DHX36 is not well understood. Here, we combine structural and biochemical studies to define the function of three auxiliary domains that contact nucleic acid. We first report the crystal structure of mouse DHX36 bound to ADP. The structure reveals an overall architecture of mouse DHX36 that is similar to previously reported architectures of fly and bovine DHX36. In addition, our structure shows conformational changes that accompany stages of the ATP-binding and hydrolysis cycle. We then examine the roles of the DHX36-specific motif (DSM), the OB-fold, and a conserved \u03b2-hairpin (\u03b2-HP) in mouse DHX36 in the remodeling of RNA structures. We demonstrate and characterize RNA duplex unwinding for DHX36 and examine the remodeling of inter- and intramolecular RNA quadruplex structures. We find that the DSM not only functions as a quadruplex binding adaptor but also promotes the remodeling of RNA duplex and quadruplex structures. The OB-fold and the \u03b2-HP contribute to RNA binding. Both domains are also essential for remodeling RNA quadruplex and duplex structures. Our data reveal roles of auxiliary domains for multiple steps of the nucleic acid remodeling reactions."

However, the structural basis for specific G-quadruplex recognition by proteins has not been understood. The DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) box RNA helicase associated with AU-rich element (RHAU) (also named DHX36 or G4R1) specifically binds to and resolves parallel-stranded G-quadruplexes.

Our structure explains how RHAU specifically recognizes parallel G-quadruplexes. The peptide covers a terminal guanine base tetrad (G-tetrad), and clamps the G-quadruplex using three-anchor-point electrostatic interactions between three positively charged amino acids and negatively charged phosphate groups. This binding mode is strikingly similar to that of most ligands selected for specific G-quadruplex targeting.

The unwinding of nucleic acid secondary structures within cells is crucial to maintain genomic integrity and prevent abortive transcription and translation initiation. DHX36, also known as RHAU or G4R1, is a DEAH-box ATP-dependent helicase highly specific for DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s). A fundamental mechanistic understanding of the interaction between helicases and their G4 substrates is important to elucidate G4 biology and pave the way toward G4-targeted therapies. Here we analyze how the thermodynamic stability of G4 substrates affects binding and unwinding by DHX36. We modulated the stability of the G4 substrates by varying the sequence and the number of G-tetrads and by using small, G4-stabilizing molecules. We found an inverse correlation between the thermodynamic stability of the G4 substrates and rates of unwinding by DHX36. In stark contrast, the ATPase activity of the helicase was largely independent of substrate stability pointing toward a decoupling mechanism akin to what has been observed for many double-stranded DEAD-box RNA helicases. Our study provides the first evidence that DHX36 uses a local, non-processive mechanism to unwind G4 substrates, reminiscent of that of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) on double-stranded substrates."

In this study, we analyze the gene expression profiles of colon cancer tissues and identify a previously unannotated lncRNA, FLJ39051, that we term GSEC (G-quadruplex-forming sequence containing lncRNA), as a lncRNA that is upregulated in colorectal cancer. We further demonstrate that knockdown of GSEC results in the reduction of colon cancer cell motility.

DHX36 is a eukaryotic DEAH/RHA family helicase that disrupts G-quadruplex structures (G4s) with high specificity, contributing to regulatory roles of G4s. Here we used a DHX36 truncation to examine the roles of the 13-amino acid DHX36-specific motif (DSM) in DNA G4 recognition and disruption. We found that the DSM promotes G4 recognition and specificity by increasing the G4 binding rate of DHX36 without affecting the dissociation rate. Further, for most of the G4s measured, the DSM has little or no effect on the G4 disruption step by DHX36, implying that contacts with the G4 are maintained through the transition state for G4 disruption. This result suggests that partial disruption of the G4 from the 3' end is sufficient to reach the overall transition state for G4 disruption, while the DSM remains unperturbed at the 5' end. Interestingly, the DSM does not contribute to G4 binding kinetics or thermodynamics at low temperature, indicating a highly modular function. Together, our results animate recent DHX36 crystal structures, suggesting a model in which the DSM recruits G4s in a modular and flexible manner by contacting the 5' face early in binding, prior to rate-limiting capture and disruption of the G4 by the helicase core."

BACKGROUND Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare syndrome characterized by immune dysregulation and hyperinflammation. It typically manifests in infancy and is associated with high mortality. METHODS We investigated the efficacy and safety of emapalumab (a human anti-interferon-\u03b3 antibody), administered with dexamethasone, in an open-label, single-group, phase 2-3 study involving patients who had received conventional therapy before enrollment (previously treated patients) and previously untreated patients who were 18 years of age or younger and had primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The patients could enter a long-term follow-up study until 1 year after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or until 1 year after the last dose of emapalumab, if transplantation was not performed. The planned 8-week treatment period could be shortened or extended if needed according to the timing of transplantation. The primary efficacy end point was the overall response, which was assessed in the previously treated patients according to objective clinical and laboratory criteria. RESULTS At the cutoff date of July 20, 2017, a total of 34 patients (27 previously treated patients and 7 previously untreated patients) had received emapalumab; 26 patients completed the study. A total of 63% of the previously treated patients and 65% of the patients who received an emapalumab infusion had a response; these percentages were significantly higher than the prespecified null hypothesis of 40% (P = 0.02 and P = 0.005, respectively). In the previously treated group, 70% of the patients were able to proceed to transplantation, as were 65% of the patients who received emapalumab. At the last observation, 74% of the previously treated patients and 71% of the patients who received emapalumab were alive. Emapalumab was not associated with any organ toxicity.

We summarized the results of current standard treatment based on chemo-immunosuppressive protocols and outlined the alternative options available. EXPERT OPINION Emapalumab is an effective treatment for HLH with a good safety profile. Its efficacy was demonstrated in a phase II/III study on primary HLH pediatric patients with refractory, relapsing HLH or intolerance to first-line treatment. The use of emapalumab allowed most patients to proceed to HSCT, with a high estimated probability of survival 12 months after transplantation. The outcomes in patients who underwent transplantation compare favorably with those reported previously with either myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimens.

AIM Primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, life-threatening, hyperinflammatory syndrome generally occurring in early childhood. The monoclonal antibody emapalumab binds and neutralises interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3). This study aimed to determine an emapalumab dosing regimen when traditional dose-finding approaches are not applicable, using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses to further clarify HLH pathogenesis and confirm IFN\u03b3 neutralisation as the relevant therapeutic target in pHLH. METHODS Initial emapalumab dosing (1 mg/kg) for pHLH patients participating in a pivotal multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2/3 study was based on anticipated IFN\u03b3 levels and allometrically scaled pharmacokinetic parameters estimated in healthy volunteers. Emapalumab dosing was adjusted based on estimated IFN\u03b3-mediated clearance and HLH clinical and laboratory criteria. Frequent dosing and emapalumab dose adaptation were used to account for highly variable IFN\u03b3 levels and potential target-mediated drug disposition. RESULTS High inter- and intra-individual variability in IFN\u03b3 production (assessed by total IFN\u03b3 levels, range: 102 -106 pg/mL) was observed in pHLH patients. Administering emapalumab reduced IFN\u03b3 activity, resulting in significant improvements in clinical and laboratory parameters and a reduced risk of adverse events, mainly related to pHLH. Modelled outcomes supported dose titration starting from 1 mg/kg, with possible increases to 3, 6 or 10 mg/kg based on re-evaluation of parameters of disease activity every 3 days. CONCLUSIONS The variable and unanticipated extremely high IFN\u03b3 concentrations in patients with pHLH are reflected in parameters of disease activity. Improved outcomes can be achieved by neutralising IFN\u03b3 using frequent emapalumab dosing and dose adaptation guided by clinical and laboratory observations."

Introduction Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a secondary form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, is a serious life-threatening complication associated with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). MAS is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, liver dysfunction, cytopenias, coagulation abnormalities, and hyperferritinemia and may progress to multiple organ failure and death. Overproduction of interferon-gamma is a major driver of hyperinflammation in murine models of MAS and primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A subset of patients with sJIA may develop progressive interstitial lung disease, which is often difficult to manage. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) can potentially be a curative immunomodulatory strategy for patients with sJIA refractory to conventional therapy and/or complicated by MAS. The use of emapalumab (anti-interferon gamma antibody) for the active control of MAS in refractory cases of sJIA and associated lung disease has not been reported. Herein we report a patient with refractory sJIA complicated by recurrent MAS and lung disease that was managed with emapalumab and ultimately followed by an allo-HSCT, which resulted in permanent correction of the underlying immune dysregulation and improvement of lung disease. Case Report We present a 4-year-old girl with sJIA complicated by recurrent MAS and progressive interstitial lung disease. She developed a progressively worsening disease that was refractory to glucocorticoids, anakinra, methotrexate, tocilizumab, and canakinumab. She had a chronic elevation of serum inflammatory markers, notably soluble interleukin-18, and CXC chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9). Emapalumab, initiated at 6 mg/kg (1 dose) and continued at 3 mg/kg twice weekly for a total of 4 weeks, resulted in MAS remission along with normalization of inflammatory markers. The patient received a matched sibling donor allo-HSCT after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen with fludarabine/melphalan/thiotepa and alemtuzumab, along with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for graft-vs.-host disease prophylaxis. At 20 months following her transplant, she has maintained a full donor engraftment with complete donor-derived immune reconstitution. She had complete resolution of sJIA symptoms including marked improvement in her lung disease along with normalization of serum interleukin-18 and CXCL9 levels. Conclusion The use of emapalumab followed by allo-HSCT could help achieve a complete response in refractory cases of sJIA complicated by MAS who have failed standard treatment."

OBJECTIVES Decompressive craniectomy is occasionally performed for patients with impending brain death, which is intended to relieve critically elevated intracranial pressure to keep effective intracranial perfusion. It has been in debate if this surgery later affects the result of brain perfusion scintigraphy performed as an ancillary test in the course of brain death diagnosis because rigid closed skull is deemed essential to elevate intracranial pressure to the point of total absence of intracranial radiotracer uptake on scintigraphy. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the impact of decompressive craniectomy on the result of brain perfusion scintigraphy in patients with suspected brain death. METHODS This retrospective cross-sectional study included consecutive 151 brain perfusion scintigraphy performed in 138 patients with suspected brain death from various causes (male 82 patients, female 56 patients; range 0-74 years; mean age 36.6 years). All exams were indicated due to inconclusive clinical diagnosis of brain death. The scintigraphy protocol consists of immediate flow phase and delayed parenchymal phase planar imaging. Additional SPECT imaging was performed in 15 studies in 14 patients. The results, positive or negative brain flow, were compared between patients with and without decompressive craniectomy using Chi-squared test. As there were patients with repeat studies, analysis was performed for both initial and final exam results. Same dataset was used for initial and final exams in patients with only one exam. RESULTS Out of 138 patients, 15 patients underwent decompressive craniectomy (11%) and 123 patients were managed medically (89%). On the initial exam, negative brain flow was demonstrated in 11 of 15 patients with craniectomy (73.3%) and 106 of 123 patients without craniectomy (86.2%). On the final exam, negative brain flow was demonstrated 12 of 15 patients with craniectomy (80%) and 111 of 123 patients without craniectomy (90.2%). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on both initial and final exams (p = 0.19 and 0.23, respectively). CONCLUSION In patients with suspected brain death, history of decompressive craniectomy does not affect the result of brain perfusion scintigraphy."

Despite these endeavors, DNC remains controversial among bioethics scholars and clinicians and is not universally accepted by patient families and the public. In this focused review, we outline the current points of contention surrounding the diagnosis of DNC in pediatric patients.

BACKGROUND Although the new Practice Parameters for brain death support a single examination, there is paucity of data comparing its impact to dual brain death (DBD) examinations. METHODS We reviewed all brain deaths in our hospital over a 39-month period and compared the optional single brain death (SBD) exam requiring an apnea and a mandatory confirmatory blood flow test to the DBD for organ function at the time of death, rate of donation, and cost. RESULTS Thirty-six patients had a SBD and 59 DBD exams, without any of them regaining neurological functioning. There was no difference in serum electrolytes (except for higher Na(+) and Cl(-) in the SBD group), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, blood gases, incidence of diabetes insipidus, apnea completion, consent for donation, and organs recovered and transplanted. During the second BD exam, 35% of patients with DBD were on higher dose of vasopressors, but had lower systolic blood pressure (P = 0.046). For DBD patients, the mean interval between the two exams was 14.4 h, which contributed to a higher cost of $43,707.67 compared to SBD. There was a trend for increased consent rates (adjusted for age, race, and type of exam) when patients were declared by the neurointensivist service following a strict family approach protocol (P = 0.06). CONCLUSION SBD exam is easier, faster to perform, with no brain function recovery and leads to similar donation rates, equivalent or better organ function status at the time of BD and lower cost than conventional DBD exams."

OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether current clinical criteria and confirmatory tests for the diagnosis of 'brain death' satisfy the requirements for the irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain including the brainstem. DATA SOURCES Medical, philosophical and legal literature on the subject of 'brain death'. DATA EXTRACTION/SYNTHESIS We present four arguments to support the view that patients who meet the current operational criteria of 'brain death' do not necessarily have the irreversible loss of all brain (or brainstem) functions. First, many clinically 'brain-dead' patients maintain residual vegetative functions that are mediated or coordinated by the brain or the brainstem. Second, it is impossible to test for any cerebral function by clinical bedside exam, because the tracts of passage to and from the cerebrum through the brainstem are destroyed or nonfunctional. Furthermore, since there are limitations of clinical assessment of internal awareness in patients who otherwise lack the motor function to show their awareness, the diagnosis of 'brain death' is based on an unproved hypothesis. Third, many patients maintain several stereotyped movements (the so-called complex spinal cord responses and automatisms) which may originate in the brainstem. Fourth, not one of the current confirmatory tests has the necessary positive predictive value for the reliable pronouncement of human death. CONCLUSION According to the above arguments, the assumption that all functions of the entire brain (or those of the brainstem) in 'brain-dead' patients have ceased, is invalidated. Reconsideration of the current concept of 'brain death' is perhaps inevitable."

However, little data are available for patients after prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in whom T cells are chimeric. In this study, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of patient-derived donor CAR-T therapy in myeloma patients with prior allo-SCT, particularly with regard to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Ide-cel was well tolerated, with no clinically relevant immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome or cytokine release syndrome observed in any patient. Importantly, no new GVHD was observed, even though all patients had a history of GVHD. All patients responded to treatment with at least a very good partial remission. Two patients relapsed within 6 months, and 1 patient was still in stringent complete remission at the time of this report. Our findings demonstrate that treatment with ide-cel is feasible, very well tolerated, and effective in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma after prior allo-SCT."

BACKGROUND Gene therapy is known to be unaffordable to those who need it the most; however, evidence on the financial impact is limited. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to estimate the budget impact and affordability of the gene therapy idecabtagene vicleucel for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM) in the US over a 3-year period from the payer healthcare perspective. METHOD A budget impact model was developed to estimate the budget impact to the US healthcare plan compared with bortezomib-based maintenance therapy. The target population size was based on a hypothetical 1-million-member plan over a 3-year time horizon with and without idecabtagene vicleucel adoption. The cost of drug acquisition, drug administration, and grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) were calculated for both scenarios. The budget impact of idecabtagene vicleucel was calculated as the difference in costs for these two scenarios. Costs were extracted from IBM-Micromedex Red Book, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the literature. A one-way sensitivity analysis was performed to ensure robustness. RESULTS An estimated 22 patients with rrMM each year would be eligible for idecabtagene vicleucel. The model projected the annual cost per patient in the first year as $19,449 and $517,528.13 for bortezomib and idecabtagene vicleucel, respectively. Introducing idecabtagene vicleucel was predicted to increase the total budget by $13.4, $13.6, and $14 million in the first, second, and third years. There would be an additional $1.1128, $1.1252, and $1.1486 per member per month (PMPM) when using idecabtagene vicleucel over bortezomib. CONCLUSION This study suggests that the high cost of the gene therapy idecabtagene vicleucel is justifiable due to the low number of rrMM patients."

BACKGROUND Two chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T (CAR T) cell therapy drugs were recently approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM). Their financial impact, however, is poorly described. OBJECTIVE The aim was to evaluate the economic burden of CAR T cell therapies ciltacabtagene autoleucel and idecabtagene vicleucel for the treatment of rrMM patients after at least four lines of therapy, and to compare the annual cost of these CAR T cell therapies over a hypothetical 1-million-member health plan from the US healthcare payer perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS The annual economic burden of ciltacabtagene autoleucel and idecabtagene vicleucel was estimated using data from pivotal clinical trials. The costs of drug acquisition, administration, and adverse event (AE) management were extracted from the IBM-Micromedex Red Book online, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services fee schedules, and a review of the literature. We used descriptive statistics for the analysis. RESULTS The annual costs (US dollars) of drug acquisition, administration, and AE management per patient were $465,000, $60,167, and $40,368 and $419,500, $61,250, and $47,270 for ciltacabtagene autoleucel and idecabtagene vicleucel, respectively. The total annual cost was higher for ciltacabtagene autoleucel ($565,534) than for idecabtagene vicleucel ($528,020). However, the total annual cost in a hypothetical 1-million-member plan was less with ciltacabtagene autoleucel, by $1.8 million.

The development of several treatment options over the last 2 decades has led to a notable improvement in the survival of patients with multiple myeloma. Despite these advances, the disease remains incurable for most patients. Moreover, standard combinations of alkylating agents, immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies targeting CD38 and corticoids are exhausted relatively fast in a proportion of high-risk patients. Such high-risk patients account for over 20% of cases and currently represent a major unmet medical need. The challenge of drug resistance requires the development of highly active new agents with a radically different mechanism of action. Several immunotherapeutic modalities, including antibody-drug conjugates and T-cell engagers, appear to be promising choices for patients who develop resistance to standard combinations. Chimeric antigen-receptor-modified T cells (CAR-Ts) targeting B-cell maturation antigen have demonstrated encouraging efficacy and an acceptable safety profile compared with alternative options. Multiple CAR-Ts are in early stages of clinical development, but the first phase III trials with CAR-Ts are ongoing for two of them. After the recent publication of the results of a phase II trial confirming a notable efficacy and acceptable safety profile, idecabtagene vicleucel is the first CAR-T to gain regulatory US Food and Drug Administration approval to treat refractory multiple myeloma patients who have already been exposed to antibodies against CD38, proteasome inhibitors, and immunomodulatory agents and who are refractory to the last therapy.

OBJECTIVE This study used the latest available data cuts from the CARTITUDE-1 and KarMMa clinical trials to update previously published matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (MAICs) assessing the comparative efficacy of ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) versus the FDA-approved idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) dose range of 300 to 450 \u00d7 106 CAR-positive T-cells in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who were previously treated with a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (i.e. triple-class exposed). METHODS MAICs were performed with the latest available individual patient data for cilta-cel (CARTITUDE-1) and published summary-level data for ide-cel (KarMMa). The analyses included treated patients from CARTITUDE-1 who satisfied the eligibility criteria for KarMMa. The MAIC adjusted for unbalanced baseline covariates of prognostic significance identified in the literature and by clinical expertise. Comparative efficacy was assessed for overall response rate (ORR), complete response or better (\u2265CR) rate, duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Cilta-cel was associated with statistically significantly improved ORR (odds ratio [OR]: 94.93 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.86, 412.25; p < .0001]; relative risk [RR]: 1.34), \u2265CR rate (OR: 5.65 [95% CI: 2.51, 12.69; p < .0001]; RR: 2.23), DoR (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.52 [95% CI: 0.30, 0.88; p = .0152]), PFS, (HR: 0.38 [95% CI: 0.24, 0.62; p < .0001]), and OS (HR: 0.43 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.88; p = .0200]) compared with ide-cel. CONCLUSIONS These analyses demonstrate improved efficacy with cilta-cel versus ide-cel for all outcomes over longer follow-up and highlight its therapeutic potential in triple-class exposed RRMM patients."

PURPOSE Epidemiologic studies have shown that various lifestyle characteristics are statistically associated with the chronic open-angle glaucomas. This study was designed to investigate the influence of individual factors on the light-microscopic morphology of the trabecular meshwork in open-angle glaucomas. METHODS Quantitative computer-assisted topographic analysis of the trabecular meshwork was performed in meridional sections of 80 trabeculectomy specimens from patients with primary open-angle (n = 36), exfoliative (n = 30) and pigment-dispersion (n = 14) glaucoma. Measurements included inner wall length of the, central thickness of the trabecular meshwork, and compactness of the Schlemm canal and trabecular meshwork. Morphologic data were correlated with individual patient data including age, duration of the disease, maximum intraocular pressure, cup-disc ratio, refraction, height, weight, body mass index, a simple morbidity index, previous surgery, and number of topical antiglaucomatous medications used. RESULTS Inner wall length of the Schlemm canal was significantly lower in eyes with previous filtering surgery (P = 0.03), but not in eyes with a high number of topical medications (P = 0.17). There was a significant tendency for the inner wall length of the Schlemm canal to be shortened in patients where high maximum intraocular pressure was combined with long-term glaucoma (P = 0.027). Body mass index did not differ significantly between patients with primary open-angle, exfoliative, and pigment-dispersion glaucoma and showed no correlation with the quantitative data of the meshwork. The morbidity index correlated well with body mass index (0.0006) and age (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Contrary to findings of experimental mice studies, we found no indication that glaucoma patients with lower body mass index have a larger lumen of the Schlemm canal than patients with a higher body mass index. Although caution should be used when interpreting data from trabeculectomy studies, there is a certain probability that a history of previous filtering surgery and of a long-term high intraocular pressure will be associated with a shortening of the Schlemm canal."

PURPOSE To examine the relationship between the extent of the incision in the Schlemm canal during suture trabeculotomy (S-LOT) for open-angle glaucoma and the associated reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP). METHODS Forty-eight consecutive eyes (primary open-angle glaucoma: 28; exfoliation glaucoma: 20) scheduled to undergo S-LOT were studied. A 320-degree opening in the Schlemm canal was planned when total circumferential cannulation had been achieved, and the remaining 40-degree region under the scleral flap was not incised. When the cannulation was incomplete, the canal was incised up to the point reached by the cannula, and the extent of the incision was measured. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential predictors of surgical success (IOP \u2264 15 mmHg). RESULTS A 320-degree incision was achieved in 23 eyes, and the mean extent of the incision was 275 \u00b1 52.3\u00b0. The mean IOP fell from 34.0 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg at baseline to 14.5 \u00b1 4.0 mmHg at 1 year postoperatively (P < 0.0001). An IOP reduction of \u226530% was achieved in 46 eyes. Simple correlation analysis indicated that the extent of the incision in degrees did not correlate with IOP or with the reduction in IOP at 1 year postoperatively (P = 0.7665 and 0.693, respectively). Lower preoperative IOP values and concomitant cataract extraction were found to be associated with surgical success.

The aim of this study has been to visualize the aqueous outflow system in patients affected by primary open angle glaucoma. A solution of indocyanine green (ICG) plus high viscosity viscoelastic solution was injected into the Schlemm canal during surgery in 10 glaucomatous patients undergoing canaloplasty. Soon after injection of the dye the borders of the scleral flap were completely stained due to partial reflux caused by the intrachannel resistance; progression of the dye along the Schlemm canal starting from the site of injection was then visualized. The filling of the collector channels was observed only in the patent portions of the Schlemm canal. The only noticeable aqueous veins were located in correspondence of the quadrant in which both the Schlemm canal and the collectors were patent. Lastly, a retrograde filling, of glomerular-shaped structures, deepest to the Schlemm canal was observed in the quadrants where the pathway was functioning. Our findings show that injection of a mixture composed of ICG and viscoelastic solution into the Schlemm canal allows a clear visualization of the functioning portions of the conventional outflow pathway. In addition, a retrograde filling of structures presumably located into the iris was also recorded. Clinical Trial Registration.

AIM To present a new, simple, inexpensive Schlemm canal microcatheter for circumferential canaloplasty in a rabbit model. METHODS A rabbit glaucoma animal model was established by intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide. Circumferential canaloplasty with a new Schlemm canal microcatheter (patent license number: 201220029850.0) was performed. The Schlemm canal microcatheter was composed of microcatheter wall and lumen. The wall was made of high refractive index plastic optical fiber that could be attached to an illuminant so that the whole lighted microcatheter was visible during circumferential canaloplasty. The lumen could be attached to an injector for injection of viscoelastic during catheterization. Rabbits were divided randomly into the control, model and treatment groups. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured with a Tono-pen tonometer pre-operation and 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28d post-operation. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was performed to visualize the Schlemm canal microcatheter in the Schlemm canal and the sclera pool. RESULTS The Schlemm canal microcatheter could be used to perform circumferential canaloplasty in the rabbit glaucoma animal model. IOP was lower in the treatment group than that in the model group 3, 7, 14 and 28d after operation. There were no significant differences in IOP between the control group and treatment group. The differences among the three groups were statistically significant (3d: F=41.985, P<0.001; 7d: F=65.696, P<0.001; 14d: F=114.599, P<0.001; 28d: F=55.006, P<0.001).

PURPOSE To investigate the morphologic features of the Schlemm canal and trabecular meshwork in highly myopic eyes with early intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation after cataract surgery. DESIGN Retrospective case-control study. METHODS Eighty-eight highly myopic eyes of 88 patients after uneventful cataract surgery were included, 31 of which had early postoperative IOP elevation and 57 of which did not. The morphologic features of the Schlemm canal and trabecular meshwork, collected with swept-source optical coherence tomography before surgery, were reviewed. Backwards stepwise multiple linear regression was used to investigate the anatomic risk factors for early IOP elevation in highly myopic eyes. RESULTS Highly myopic eyes with early postoperative IOP elevation had smaller Schlemm canal vertical diameter and area, as well as smaller trabecular meshwork thickness and width, in each quadrant than the non-elevation group. There was no significant difference in Schlemm canal horizontal diameter between the IOP elevation and non-elevation groups. In the highly myopic eyes, average Schlemm canal vertical diameter, Schlemm canal area, trabecular meshwork thickness, and width were all correlated negatively with the IOP elevation. A multivariate analysis showed that average Schlemm canal vertical diameter (\u03b2 = -0.262, P = .004) and trabecular meshwork thickness (\u03b2 = -0.173, P < .001) were significantly associated with early transient IOP elevation in highly myopic cataract eyes.

PURPOSE To investigate the cause of secondary open-angle glaucoma due to sarcoidosis. DESIGN Observational case series studied by histological methods. METHODS Seven trabeculectomy specimens from six patients with secondary open-angle glaucoma due to ocular sarcoidosis (trabeculectomy group) and anterior parts of seven autopsy eyes from four patients (autopsy eye group) diagnosed as confirmed sarcoidosis were processed for light and transmission electron microscopy. Pathological changes of outflow routes were investigated. RESULTS Granulomata were found in three eyes of the trabeculectomy group and in three eyes of the autopsy eye group. Part of the Schlemm canal was occluded and replaced by fibrotic tissue and it became narrow in four eyes of the trabeculectomy group and three eyes of the autopsy eye group. The spaces of the trabecular meshwork appeared wide, even in the area close to granulomata and peripheral anterior synechia of the iris. Infiltration of lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages around the Schlemm canal was found in all eyes of the trabeculectomy group and in four eyes of the autopsy eye group. The infiltration of these cells was observed not only in the inner wall, but also in the posterior outer wall of the Schlemm canal and the collector channels. CONCLUSION \"Schlemm canalitis\" is proposed from the results of inflammatory cell infiltration around the wall of the canal.

PURPOSE To evaluate whether selective laser trabeculoplasty and prostaglandin analogs regulate the permeability of cultured human Schlemm canal cells by inducing intercellular junction disassembly. DESIGN Laboratory investigation. METHODS Intercellular junctions were made visible in living cells by making them fluoresce after transfection with a plasmid expressing the zonula occludens 1 protein tagged with green fluorescent protein. Schlemm canal cells were treated by direct laser irradiation; by exposure to media conditioned by either lasered Schlemm canal cells or trabecular meshwork cells; by exposure to the prostaglandin analogs latanoprost, bimatoprost, and travoprost; or by the addition of the nonprostaglandin agents brimonidine, timolol, and dorzolamide. Junction disassembly was monitored using fluorescence microscopy, and permeability alterations were measured as changes in conductivity using flow meters. RESULTS The direct laser irradiation of Schlemm canal cells caused a 3-fold increase in conductivity. Exposure of the cells to media conditioned by lasered Schlemm canal cells or trabecular meshwork cells induced junction disassembly and a 2- to 4-fold increase in conductivity. Exposure to prostaglandin analogs also induced junction disassembly and a 4- to 16-fold increase in conductivity, whereas the 3 nonprostaglandin agents tested were ineffective in both regards. CONCLUSIONS Exposure to factors secreted by lasered Schlemm canal cells and lasered trabecular meshwork cells and the application of prostaglandin analogs induced junction disassembly while increasing the permeability of Schlemm canal cells.

He grew up in a village in the Duchy of Braunschweig (Brunswick). As his family could not afford higher education, he was apprenticed to a barber-surgeon in Braunschweig. This gave him the opportunity to study anatomy and surgery at the local Anatomico-Surgical Institute. Recently discovered archival sources demonstrate that, in June of 1816, Schlemm and a fellow student disinterred the body of a deceased woman late at night in a Braunschweig churchyard to bring the body to this Institute and study the effects of rickets on the woman's bones. They were caught and sentenced to 4 weeks of prison. Subsequently, Schlemm left Braunschweig and found work as a low-rank army surgeon in Berlin. Professor Rudolphi, the director of the Berlin Institute of Anatomy, took note of Schlemm's manual dexterity in anatomical dissection and supported his impressive career. Schlemm eventually became full professor of anatomy in 1833 and spent his remaining 25 years in Berlin with a focus on teaching students and training surgeons. As historical background information is largely lacking in this regard, it is impossible to decide whether Schlemm's episode of grave robbing was a solitary instance or a more common method of acquiring bodies for anatomical instruction in early 19th century Germany."

BACKGROUND Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is a rare enzyme-linked glycolytic defect resulting in mild-to-severe chronic persistent erythrocyte hemolysis. The disease is an autosomal recessive trait caused by mutations in the PK liver and red blood cell gene characterized by insufficient erythrocyte PK activity. PK deficiency is most diagnosed in persons of northern European descent and managed with packed red blood cell transfusions, chelation, and splenectomy with cholecystectomy. Mitapivat is the first approved therapy indicated for hemolytic anemia in adults with PK deficiency with the potential for delaying splenectomy in mild-moderate disease. MECHANISM OF ACTION, PHARMACODYNAMICS, AND PHARMACOKINETICS Mitapivat is a PK activator that acts by allosterically binding to the PK tetramer and increases PK activity. The red blood cell form of PK is mutated in PK deficiency, which leads to reduced adenosine triphosphate, shortened red blood cell lifespan, and chronic hemolysis. The half-life of elimination is 3-5 hours, with 73% bioavailability, 98% plasma protein binding, and a median duration of response of 7 months. CLINICAL TRIALS Mitapivat has been investigated through various clinical trials for different therapeutic indications. Pivotal trials that serve the primary focus throughout this article are ACTIVATE, ACTIVATE-T, and RISE. ACTIVATE is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of mitapivat in adult patients who were not receiving regular blood transfusions. Contrarily, ACTIVATE-T explored the safety and efficacy of mitapivat in adults with PK deficiency who received regular blood transfusions. Both trials demonstrated favorable use of mitapivat in PK deficiency. Focusing on another indication, the ongoing RISE trial investigates the optimal dosage of mitapivat in sickle cell disease. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCE Mitapivat is an appropriate treatment for adults with PK deficiency requiring transfusions and may be considered for patients with symptomatic anemia who do not require transfusions and/or PK deficiency with compensated hemolysis without overt anemia."

Mitapivat (Pyrukynd\u00ae), an oral, allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase (PK), is approved in the USA for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia in adults with PK deficiency and in the EU and UK for the treatment of PK deficiency in adults. Mitapivat acts by restoring activity of the red blood cell (RBC) PK enzyme, which is dysfunctional due to genetic mutations in the PKLR gene in patients with PK deficiency. In the double-blind placebo-controlled phase III ACTIVATE trial in adults with PK deficiency who were not regularly RBC transfused, mitapivat was superior to placebo in improving haemoglobin levels. In the single-arm phase III ACTIVATE-T trial in adults with PK deficiency who were regularly RBC transfused, a reduction in RBC transfusion burden was observed with mitapivat. In both trials, mitapivat improved other clinical parameters of haemolysis and patient-reported health-related quality of life. At the approved twice-daily dosage range, mitapivat was generally well tolerated, with adverse events generally being mild to moderate in severity. Results from an ongoing extension study in previously enrolled phase III trial patients will be of interest.

Mitapivat (AG-348) is a novel, first-in-class oral small molecule allosteric activator of the pyruvate kinase enzyme. Mitapivat has been shown to significantly upregulate both wild-type and numerous mutant forms of erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PKR), increasing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and reducing levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Given this mechanism, mitapivat has been evaluated in clinical trials in a wide range of hereditary hemolytic anemias, including pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD), sickle cell disease, and the thalassemias. The clinical development of mitapivat in adults with PKD is nearly complete, with the completion of two successful phase III clinical trials demonstrating its safety and efficacy. Given these findings, mitapivat has the potential to be the first approved therapeutic for PKD. Mitapivat has additionally been evaluated in a phase II trial of patients with alpha- and beta-thalassemia and a phase I trial of patients with sickle cell disease, with findings suggesting safety and efficacy in these more common hereditary anemias. Following these successful early-phase trials, two phase III trials of mitapivat in thalassemia and a phase II/III trial of mitapivat in sickle cell disease are beginning worldwide. Promising preclinical studies have additionally been done evaluating mitapivat in hereditary spherocytosis, suggesting potential efficacy in erythrocyte membranopathies as well. With convenient oral dosing and a safety profile comparable with placebo in adults with PKD, mitapivat is a promising new therapeutic for several hereditary hemolytic anemias, including those without any currently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved drug therapies. This review discusses the preclinical studies, pharmacology, and clinical trials of mitapivat."

METHODS In this global, phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of mitapivat in adults with pyruvate kinase deficiency who were not receiving regular red-cell transfusions. The patients were assigned to receive either mitapivat (5 mg twice daily, with potential escalation to 20 or 50 mg twice daily) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was a hemoglobin response (an increase from baseline of \u22651.5 g per deciliter in the hemoglobin level) that was sustained at two or more scheduled assessments at weeks 16, 20, and 24. Secondary efficacy end points were the average change from baseline in the hemoglobin level, markers of hemolysis and hematopoiesis, and the change from baseline at week 24 in two pyruvate kinase deficiency-specific patient-reported outcome measures. RESULTS Sixteen of the 40 patients (40%) in the mitapivat group had a hemoglobin response, as compared with none of the 40 patients in the placebo group (adjusted difference, 39.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 24.1 to 54.6; two-sided P<0.001). Patients who received mitapivat had a greater response than those who received placebo with respect to each secondary end point, including the average change from baseline in the hemoglobin level. The most common adverse events were nausea (in 7 patients [18%] in the mitapivat group and 9 patients [23%] in the placebo group) and headache (in 6 patients [15%] and 13 patients [33%], respectively). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 10 patients (25%) who received mitapivat and 5 patients (13%) who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS In patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency, mitapivat significantly increased the hemoglobin level, decreased hemolysis, and improved patient-reported outcomes. No new safety signals were identified in the patients who received mitapivat. (Funded by Agios Pharmaceuticals; ACTIVATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03548220.)."

Polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) leads to erythrocyte sickling. Enhancing activity of the erythrocyte glycolytic pathway has anti-sickling potential as this reduces 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) and increases ATP, factors that decrease HbS polymerization and improve erythrocyte membrane integrity. These factors can be modulated by mitapivat, which activates erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PKR) and improves sickling kinetics in SCD patients. We investigated mechanisms by which mitapivat may impact SCD by examining its effects in the Townes SCD mouse model. Control (HbAA) and sickle (HbSS) mice were treated with mitapivat or vehicle. Surprisingly, HbSS had higher PKR protein, higher ATP, and lower 2,3-DPG levels, compared to HbAA mice, in contrast with humans with SCD, in whom 2,3-DPG is elevated compared to healthy subjects. Despite our inability to investigate 2,3-DPG-mediated sickling and hemoglobin effects, mitapivat yielded potential benefits in HbSS mice. Mitapivat further increased ATP without significantly changing 2,3-DPG or hemoglobin levels, and decreased levels of leukocytosis, erythrocyte oxidative stress, and the percentage of erythrocytes that retained mitochondria in HbSS mice. These data suggest that, even though Townes HbSS mice have increased PKR activity, further activation of PKR with mitapivat yields potentially beneficial effects that are independent of changes in sickling or hemoglobin levels."

Mitapivat, a first-in-class, oral, small-molecule, allosteric activator of the red blood cell-specific form of pyruvate kinase (PKR), was approved for the treatment of hemolytic anemia in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. In this phase I mass balance study in healthy males, we administered a single ~120 mg oral dose of [14 C]mitapivat and a concomitant intravenous ~0.1 mg microdose of [13 C6 ]mitapivat. We determined (1) the routes of total radioactivity excretion, including the mass balance of total radioactivity in urine and feces; (2) the pharmacokinetics of mitapivat and [13 C6 ]mitapivat in plasma and total radioactivity in whole blood and plasma; (3) the absolute oral bioavailability of mitapivat; and (4) the metabolite profiles in plasma and excreta. Mean recovery of the radioactive dose was 89.1% (49.6% in urine and 39.6% in feces). [14 C]Mitapivat was rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized as <4% of the total radioactive dose was excreted unaltered in urine and feces. Mean absolute oral bioavailability was 72.7%. A total of 17 metabolites were identified. Mitapivat accounted for 57% and 34% of plasma radioactivity in AUC0-24 and AUC0-72 pooled samples, respectively. The remaining radioactivity was attributable to several metabolites, each representing <10% of the total radioactivity in pooled samples; none were disproportionate metabolites as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration and International Conference on Harmonisation M3 guidelines. Metabolite structures suggest that the primary metabolic pathways for [14 C]mitapivat in humans include N-dealkylation of the cyclopropylmethyl moiety, oxygenation of the quinoline-8-sulfonamide, oxidation/unsaturation, scission of the piperazine moiety, and amide hydrolysis."

Anemia in \u03b2-thalassemia is related to ineffective erythropoiesis and reduced red cell survival. Excess free heme and accumulation of unpaired \u03b1-globin chains impose substantial oxidative stress on \u03b2-thalassemic erythroblasts and erythrocytes, impacting cell metabolism. We hypothesized that increased pyruvate kinase activity induced by mitapivat (AG-348) in the Hbbth3/+ mouse model for \u03b2-thalassemia would reduce chronic hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis through stimulation of red cell glycolytic metabolism. Oral mitapivat administration ameliorated ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia in Hbbth3/+ mice. Increased ATP, reduced reactive oxygen species production, and reduced markers of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with improved mitochondrial clearance suggested enhanced metabolism following mitapivat administration in \u03b2-thalassemia. The amelioration of responsiveness to erythropoietin resulted in reduced soluble erythroferrone, increased liver Hamp expression, and diminished liver iron overload. Mitapivat reduced duodenal Dmt1 expression potentially by activating the pyruvate kinase M2-HIF2\u03b1 axis, representing a mechanism additional to Hamp in controlling iron absorption and preventing \u03b2-thalassemia-related liver iron overload. In ex vivo studies on erythroid precursors from patients with \u03b2-thalassemia, mitapivat enhanced erythropoiesis, promoted erythroid maturation, and decreased apoptosis. Overall, pyruvate kinase activation as a treatment modality for \u03b2-thalassemia in preclinical model systems had multiple beneficial effects in the erythropoietic compartment and beyond, providing a strong scientific basis for further clinical trials."

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is the most common, nonimmune, hereditary, chronic hemolytic anemia after hemoglobinopathies. The genetic defects in membrane function causing HS lead to perturbation of the RBC metabolome, with altered glycolysis. In mice genetically lacking protein 4.2 (4.2-/-; Epb42), a murine model of HS, we showed increased expression of pyruvate kinase (PK) isoforms in whole and fractioned RBCs in conjunction with abnormalities in the glycolytic pathway and in the glutathione (GSH) system. Mitapivat, a PK activator, metabolically reprogrammed 4.2-/- mouse RBCs with amelioration of glycolysis and the GSH cycle. This resulted in improved osmotic fragility, reduced phosphatidylserine positivity, amelioration of RBC cation content, reduction of Na/K/Cl cotransport and Na/H-exchange overactivation, and decrease in erythroid vesicles release in vitro. Mitapivat treatment significantly decreased erythrophagocytosis and beneficially affected iron homeostasis. In mild-to-moderate HS, the beneficial effect of splenectomy is still controversial. Here, we showed that splenectomy improves anemia in 4.2-/- mice and that mitapivat is noninferior to splenectomy. An additional benefit of mitapivat treatment was lower expression of markers of inflammatory vasculopathy in 4.2-/- mice with or without splenectomy, indicating a multisystemic action of mitapivat. These findings support the notion that mitapivat treatment should be considered for symptomatic HS."

Importance An unmet need remains for safe and efficacious treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). To date, there are limited agents available that address the underlying cause of the disease. Objective To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of viltolarsen, a novel antisense oligonucleotide, in participants with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping. Design, Setting, and Participants This phase 2 study was a 4-week randomized clinical trial for safety followed by a 20-week open-label treatment period of patients aged 4 to 9 years with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping. To enroll 16 participants, with 8 participants in each of the 2 dose cohorts, 17 participants were screened. Study enrollment occurred between December 16, 2016, and August 17, 2017, at sites in the US and Canada. Data were collected from December 2016 to February 2018, and data were analyzed from April 2018 to May 2019. Interventions Participants received 40 mg/kg (low dose) or 80 mg/kg (high dose) of viltolarsen administered by weekly intravenous infusion. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes of the trial included safety, tolerability, and de novo dystrophin protein production measured by Western blot in participants' biceps muscles. Secondary outcomes included additional assessments of dystrophin mRNA and protein production as well as clinical muscle strength and function. Results Of the 16 included boys with DMD, 15 (94%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 7.4 (1.8) years. After 20 to 24 weeks of treatment, significant drug-induced dystrophin production was seen in both viltolarsen dose cohorts (40 mg/kg per week: mean [range] 5.7% [3.2-10.3] of normal; 80 mg/kg per week: mean [range] 5.9% [1.1-14.4] of normal). Viltolarsen was well tolerated; no treatment-emergent adverse events required dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation of the study drug. No serious adverse events or deaths occurred during the study. Compared with 65 age-matched and treatment-matched natural history controls, all 16 participants treated with viltolarsen showed significant improvements in timed function tests from baseline, including time to stand from supine (viltolarsen: -0.19 s; control: 0.66 s), time to run/walk 10 m (viltolarsen: 0.23 m/s; control: -0.04 m/s), and 6-minute walk test (viltolarsen: 28.9 m; control: -65.3 m) at the week 25 visit. Conclusions and Relevance Systemic treatment of participants with DMD with viltolarsen induced de novo dystrophin production, and clinical improvement of timed function tests was observed.

BACKGROUND Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by DMD gene mutations, resulting in absence of functional dystrophin protein. Viltolarsen, an exon 53 skipping therapy, significantly increased dystrophin levels in patients with DMD. Presented here are completed study results of > 4 years of functional outcomes in viltolarsen-treated patients compared to a historical control group (Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study [CINRG DNHS]). OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of viltolarsen for an additional 192 weeks in boys with DMD. METHODS This phase 2, open-label, 192-week long-term extension (LTE) study (NCT03167255) evaluated the efficacy and safety of viltolarsen in participants aged 4 to < 10 years at baseline with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping. All 16 participants from the initial 24-week study enrolled into this LTE. Timed function tests were compared to the CINRG DNHS group. All participants received glucocorticoid treatment. The primary efficacy outcome was time to stand from supine (TTSTAND). Secondary efficacy outcomes included additional timed function tests. Safety was continuously assessed. RESULTS For the primary efficacy outcome (TTSTAND), viltolarsen-treated patients showed stabilization of motor function over the first two years and significant slowing of disease progression over the following two years compared with the CINRG DNHS control group which declined. Viltolarsen was well tolerated, with most reported treatment-emergent adverse events being mild or moderate. No participants discontinued drug during the study. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results of this 4-year LTE, viltolarsen can be an important treatment strategy for DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal, X-linked recessive disorder characterized by progressive muscle loss and cardiorespiratory complications. Mutations in the DMD gene that eliminate the production of dystrophin protein are the underlying causes of DMD. Viltolarsen is a drug of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) chemistry, designed to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene. It aims to produce truncated but partially functional dystrophin in DMD patients and restore muscle function. Based on a preclinical study showing the ability of antisense PMOs targeting the DMD gene to improve muscle function in a large animal model, viltolarsen was developed by Nippon Shinyaku and the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry in Japan. Following clinical trials conducted in Japan, Canada, and the United States showing significant improvements in muscle function, viltolarsen was approved for medical use in Japan in March 2020 and the United States in August 2020, respectively. Viltolarsen is a mutation-specific drug and will work for 8% of the persons with DMD who carry mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping. This review summarizes the pharmacological profile of viltolarsen, important clinical trials, and challenges, focusing on the contribution of Japanese patients and researchers in its development."

We investigated viltolarsen's ability to induce dystrophin expression and examined its safety in DMD patients. METHODS In this open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, phase 1/2, exploratory study, 16 ambulant and nonambulant males aged 5-12 years with DMD received viltolarsen 40 or 80 mg/kg/week via intravenous infusion for 24 weeks.

RESULTS In western blot analysis, mean changes in dystrophin expression (% normal) from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 were - 1.21 (P = 0.5136) and 1.46 (P = 0.1636), respectively, in the 40 mg/kg group, and 0.76 (P = 0.2367) and 4.81 (P = 0.0536), respectively, in the 80 mg/kg group.

All adverse events were judged to be mild or moderate in intensity and none led to study discontinuation. INTERPRETATION Treatment with viltolarsen 40 or 80 mg/kg elicited an increasing trend in dystrophin expression and exon 53 skipping levels, and was safe and well tolerated. The decline in motor function appeared less marked in patients with higher dystrophin levels; this may warrant further investigation.

INTRODUCTION Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive genetic disease leading to muscular weakness. DMD is caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome that is responsible for production of dystrophin protein. Dystrophin contributes to structural support in muscle cells and mutations result in dystrophin protein deficiency which causes muscle damage and the associated clinical presentation. Exon skipping medications, including the exon 53 targeting viltolarsen, are the first agents with the ability to partially restore dystrophin protein. AREAS COVERED Herein, the authors profile viltolarsen for the DMD patients who are amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy and provide their expert perspectives on this subject. EXPERT OPINION Current findings suggest that viltolarsen could play a role in the current and possible future treatment of DMD. Viltolarsen seems to be safe and restores dystrophin protein to around 6% of the normal level. Due to orphan drug status, after the completion of the phase 2 clinical trial, viltolarsen was granted accelerated approval in Japan and in the US. A phase 3 trial is currently in progress and needs to earn full approval. Although a multidisciplinary approach continues to be critical, the addition of exon skipping agents like viltolarsen may improve the quality of patients' lives. However, data on the long-term safety and efficacy of this medication are not yet available due to its recent accelerated approval."

Daily and intermittent administrations are both in common use with different efficacy and different side effect profile.\u2022 There are no established guidelines for age/stage at initiation and treatment duration of GCS. Common practice is initiation of GCS before the child is starting to decline (between age 3 and 6 years) and continuation of monitored treatment after loss of ambulation, aiming at delaying cardiac and respiratory manifestations and preventing the development of scoliosis.\u2022 Prevention, monitoring, and treatment of the side effects of long-term chronic GCS use, such as excessive weight gain, hypertension, osteoporosis, impairment of glucose metabolism, delayed puberty, and cataract, should be integrated in the standards of care.\u2022 Noninvasive ventilatory support associated with cough assisting techniques has significantly improved the longevity in DMD.\u2022 Pharmacologic treatment for cardiac manifestations includes the standard treatments of dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia such as the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and diuretics. The lack of robust controlled data hampers clear recommendations about preventive treatment with ACE inhibitors.\u2022 DMD is associated with low bone mineral content, which is aggravated by the use of corticosteroids. The use of biphosphonates can be considered in the treatment of painful vertebral fractures. The use of biphosphonates as a preventive treatment should be investigated in randomized controlled studies.\u2022 DMD has evolved from a pediatric disease to an adult condition. This underscores the need to prepare adult neurologists for the optimal surveillance and management of patients with a severe chronic disease that have outgrown the pediatric care and that may develop new disease manifestations with improved longevity."

This disease is more contagious than influenza such that cluster outbreaks occur frequently. If patients with symptoms quickly underwent testing and contact tracing, these outbreaks could be contained. Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients have symptoms similar to other common illnesses. Here, we hypothesize the order of symptom occurrence could help patients and medical professionals more quickly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases, yet such essential information is largely unavailable. To this end, we apply a Markov Process to a graded partially ordered set based on clinical observations of COVID-19 cases to ascertain the most likely order of discernible symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) in COVID-19 patients. We then compared the progression of these symptoms in COVID-19 to other respiratory diseases, such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, to observe if the diseases present differently. Our model predicts that influenza initiates with cough, whereas COVID-19 like other coronavirus-related diseases initiates with fever. However, COVID-19 differs from SARS and MERS in the order of gastrointestinal symptoms. Our results support the notion that fever should be used to screen for entry into facilities as regions begin to reopen after the outbreak of Spring 2020. Additionally, our findings suggest that good clinical practice should involve recording the order of symptom occurrence in COVID-19 and other diseases. If such a systemic clinical practice had been standard since ancient diseases, perhaps the transition from local outbreak to pandemic could have been avoided."

BACKGROUND Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019, more than 8 million cases have occurred worldwide as of June 16, 2020. However, it is important to distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza. Here, we comparatively described the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 and paediatric patients with influenza. METHODS In this retrospective, single-centre study, we reviewed the electronic medical records of 585 paediatric patients with COVID-19 or influenza in Wuhan Children's Hospital, China. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes were comparatively analysed. RESULTS The median ages were 6.96 years (IQR, 2-10.81) for children with confirmed COVID-19, 2.67 years (IQR, 1.03-15.25) for those with influenza A and 3.67 years (IQR, 1.62-5.54) for those with influenza B. Fever was a symptom in 84 (34.7%) COVID-19 cases, 132 (70.21%) influenza A cases and 111 (74.50%) influenza B cases. The median length of stay (LOS) was 11 (8-15) days for paediatric COVID-19 patients, 4 (3-6) days for influenza A patients and 5 (3-6) days for influenza B patients. Twenty-six (13.98%) influenza A patients and 18 (12.59%) influenza B patients presented with decreased white blood cell counts, while 13 (5.33%) COVID-19 patients presented with decreased white blood cell counts. Eight (3.28%) COVID-19 patients, 23 (12.71%) influenza A patients and 21 (14.79%) influenza B patients experienced lymphocytopenia. Acute cardiac injury occurred in 18 (7.29%) COVID-19 patients, while 37 (19.68%) influenza A and 27 (18.12%) influenza B patients had acute cardiac injury. CONCLUSION In this study, the illnesses of children with COVID-19 were demonstrated to be less severe than those of paediatric patients with influenza, and COVID-19 patients had milder illness and fewer complications."

It is important to characterize the differences in disease presentation and trajectory between COVID-19 patients and other patients with common respiratory illnesses. These differences can enhance knowledge of pathogenesis and help in guiding treatment. Methods: Data from electronic medical records were obtained from individuals admitted with respiratory illnesses to Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel, between October 1st, 2014 and October 1st, 2020. Four groups of patients were defined: COVID-19 (693), influenza (1,612), severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) (2,292), and Others (4,054). The variable analyzed include demographics (7), vital signs (8), lab tests (38), and comorbidities (15) from a total of 8,651 hospitalized adult patients. Statistical analysis was performed on biomarkers measured at admission and for their disease trajectory in the first 48 h of hospitalization, and on comorobidity prevalence. Results: COVID-19 patients were overall younger in age and had higher body mass index, compared to influenza and SARI. Comorbidity burden was lower in the COVID-19 group compared to influenza and SARI. Severely- and moderately-ill COVID-19 patients older than 65 years of age suffered higher rate of in-hospital mortality compared to hospitalized influenza patients. At admission, white blood cells and neutrophils were lower among COVID-19 patients compared to influenza and SARI patients, while pulse rate and lymphoctye percentage were higher. Trajectories of variables during the first 2 days of hospitalization revealed that white blood count, neutrophils percentage and glucose in blood increased among COVID-19 patients, while decreasing among other patients. Conclusions: The intrinsic virulence of COVID-19 appeared higher than influenza. In addition, several critical functions, such as immune response, coagulation, heart and respiratory function, and metabolism were uniquely affected by COVID-19."

This retrospective study was conducted at the Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. Patients who visited the outdoor epidemic prevention screening station for respiratory infection from February 19 to April 30, 2020, were evaluated for blood biomarkers to distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory infections. Monocyte distribution width (MDW) \u2265 20 (odds ratio [OR]: 8.39, p = 0.0110, area under curve [AUC]: 0.703) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) < 3.2 (OR: 4.23, p = 0.0494, AUC: 0.673) could independently distinguish COVID-19 from common upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Combining MDW \u2265 20 and NLR < 3.2 was more efficient in identifying COVID-19 (AUC: 0.840). Moreover, MDW \u2265 20 and NLR > 5 effectively identified influenza infection (AUC: 0.7055).

BACKGROUND During the first wave of COVID-19 it was hypothesized that COVID-19 is subject to multi-wave seasonality, similar to Influenza-Like Illnesses since time immemorial. One year into the pandemic, we aimed to test the seasonality hypothesis for COVID-19. METHODS We calculated the average annual time-series for Influenza-Like Illnesses based on incidence data from 2016 till 2019 in the Netherlands, and compared these with two COVID-19 time-series during 2020/2021 for the Netherlands. We plotted the time-series on a standardized logarithmic infection scale. Finally, we calculated correlation coefficients and used univariate regression analysis to estimate the strength of the association between the time-series of COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses. RESULTS The time-series for COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses were strongly and highly significantly correlated. The COVID-19 peaks were all during flu season, and lows were all in the opposing period. Finally, COVID-19 meets the multi-wave characteristics of earlier flu-like pandemics, namely a short first wave at the tail-end of a flu season, and a longer and more intense second wave during the subsequent flu season. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that seasonal patterns of COVID-19 incidence and Influenza-Like Illnesses incidence are highly similar, in a country in the temperate climate zone, such as the Netherlands. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic satisfies the criteria of earlier respiratory pandemics, namely a first wave that is short-lived at the tail-end of flu season, and a second wave that is longer and more severe.This seems to imply that the same factors that are driving the seasonality of Influenza-Like Illnesses are causing COVID-19 seasonality as well, such as solar radiation (UV), temperature, relative humidity, and subsequently seasonal allergens and allergies."

Determining which design features contribute to the efficacy of LMOs will be beneficial for further improving LMOs for use in research. Aim We investigated the relative impact of luciferase brightness, opsin sensitivity, pairing of emission and absorption wavelength, and arrangement of moieties on the function of LMOs. Approach We quantified efficacy of LMOs through whole cell patch clamp recordings in HEK293 cells by determining coupling efficiency, the percentage of maximum LED induced photocurrent achieved with bioluminescent activation of an opsin. We confirmed key results by multielectrode array (MEAs) recordings in primary neurons. Results Luciferase brightness and opsin sensitivity had the most impact on the efficacy of LMOs, and N-terminal fusions of luciferases to opsins performed better than C-terminal and multi-terminal fusions. Precise paring of luciferase emission and opsin absorption spectra appeared to be less critical. Conclusions Whole cell patch clamp recordings allowed us to quantify the impact of different characteristics of LMOs on their function. Our results suggest that coupling brighter bioluminescent sources to more sensitive opsins will improve LMO function. As bioluminescent activation of opsins is most likely based on F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), the most effective strategy for improving LMOs further will be molecular evolution of luciferase-fluorescent protein-opsin fusions."

Luminopsins (LMOs) are chimeric proteins consisting of a luciferase fused to an opsin that provide control of neuronal activity, allowing for less cumbersome and less invasive optogenetic manipulation. It was previously shown that both an external light source and the luciferase substrate, coelenterazine (CTZ), could modulate activity of LMO-expressing neurons, although the magnitudes of the photoresponses remained subpar. In this study, we created an enhanced iteration of the excitatory luminopsin LMO3, termed eLMO3, that has improved membrane targeting due to the insertion of a Golgi trafficking signal sequence. In cortical neurons in culture, the expression of eLMO3 resulted in significant reductions in the formation of intracellular aggregates, as well as in a significant increase in total photocurrents. Furthermore, we corroborated the findings with injections of adeno-associated viral vectors into the deep layers of the somatosensory cortex (the barrel cortex) of male mice. We observed greatly reduced numbers of intracellular puncta in eLMO3-expressing cortical neurons compared to those expressing the original LMO3. Finally, we quantified CTZ-driven behavior, namely whisker-touching behavior, in male mice with LMO3 expression in the barrel cortex. After CTZ administration, mice with eLMO3 displayed significantly longer whisker responses than mice with LMO3. In summary, we have engineered the superior LMO by resolving membrane trafficking defects, and we demonstrated improved membrane targeting, greater photocurrents, and greater functional responses to stimulate with CTZ."

Building on previous development of fusions of wild-type Gaussia luciferase with channelrhodopsin, here we expanded the utility of luminopsins by fusing bright Gaussia luciferase variants with either channelrhodopsin to excite neurons (luminescent opsin, LMO) or a proton pump to inhibit neurons (inhibitory LMO, iLMO). These improved LMOs could reliably activate or silence neurons in vitro and in vivo. Expression of the improved LMO in hippocampal circuits not only enabled mapping of synaptic activation of CA1 neurons with fine spatiotemporal resolution but also could drive rhythmic circuit excitation over a large spatiotemporal scale. Furthermore, virus-mediated expression of either LMO or iLMO in the substantia nigra in vivo produced not only the expected bidirectional control of single unit activity but also opposing effects on circling behavior in response to systemic injection of a luciferase substrate. Thus, although preserving the ability to be activated by external light sources, LMOs expand the use of optogenetics by making the same opsins accessible to noninvasive, chemogenetic control, thereby allowing the same probe to manipulate neuronal activity over a range of spatial and temporal scales."

However, how CA3 functions in spatial and episodic memory in different time scales (i.e. short-term versus long term) without permanent lesions has not been systematically investigated yet. Taking advantage of the chemogenetic access to opsins, this study used luminopsins, fusion proteins of luciferase and optogenetic elements, to manipulate neuronal activity in CA3 during memory tasks over a range of spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we found that excitation or inhibition of CA3 neurons had no significant effects on long-term spatial or episodic memory, but had remarkable effects on spatial working memory, spatial short-term memory as well as episodic short-term memory. In addition, stimulation of CA3 neurons altered the expression levels of NR2A. Intracerebral injection of receptor inhibitors further confirmed that NR2A is crucial to spatial working memory, which is consistent with the luminopsins experiments.

Although molecular tools for controlling neuronal activity by light have vastly expanded, there are still unmet needs which require development and refinement. For example, light delivery into the brain is still a major practical challenge that hinders potential translation of optogenetics in human patients. In addition, it would be advantageous to manipulate neuronal activity acutely and precisely as well as chronically and non-invasively, using the same genetic construct in animal models. We have previously addressed these challenges by employing bioluminescence and have created a new line of opto-chemogenetic probes termed luminopsins by fusing light-sensing opsins with light-emitting luciferases. In this report, we incorporated Chlamydomonas channelrhodopsin 2 with step-function mutations as the opsin moiety in the new luminopsin fusion protein termed step-function luminopsin (SFLMO). Bioluminescence-induced photocurrent lasted longer than the bioluminescence signal due to very slow deactivation of the mutated channel. In addition, bioluminescence was able to activate most of the channels on the cell surface due to the extremely high light sensitivity of the channel. This efficient channel activation was partly mediated by radiationless bioluminescence resonance energy transfer due to the proximity of luciferase and opsin. To test the utility of SFLMOs in vivo, we transduced the substantia nigra unilaterally via a viral vector in male rats. Injection of the luciferase substrate as well as conventional photostimulation via fiber optics elicited circling behaviors. Thus, SFLMOs expand the current approaches for manipulation of neuronal activity in the brain and add more versatility and practicality to optogenetics in freely behaving animals."

Functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is poor, mainly due to the slow and incomplete regeneration of injured axons. Experimental therapies that increase the excitability of the injured axons have proven remarkably successful in promoting regeneration, but their clinical applicability has been limited. Bioluminescent optogenetics (BL-OG) uses luminopsins, fusion proteins of light-generating luciferase and light-sensing ion channels that could be used to increase neuronal excitability if exposed to a suitable substrate. Excitatory luminopsins were expressed in motoneurons of transgenic mice and in wildtype mice transduced with adeno-associated viral vectors. Intraperitoneal administration of coelenterazine (CTZ), a known luciferase substrate, generated intense bioluminescence in peripheral axons. This bioluminescence increased motoneuron excitability. A single administration of CTZ immediately after sciatic nerve transection and repair markedly enhanced motor axon regeneration. Compound muscle action potentials were 3-4 times larger than controls by 4 weeks after injury. The results observed with transgenic mice were comparable to those of mice in which the luminopsin was expressed using viral vectors. Significantly more motoneurons had successfully reinnervated muscle targets four weeks after nerve injury in BL-OG treated mice than in controls.

Lupins (Lupinus spp.) are nitrogen-fixing legumes that accumulate toxic alkaloids in their protein-rich beans. These anti-nutritional compounds belong to the family of quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs), which are of interest to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. To unleash the potential of lupins as protein crops and as sources of QAs, a thorough understanding of the QA pathway is needed. However, only the first enzyme in the pathway, lysine decarboxylase (LDC), is known. Here, we report the transcriptome of a high-QA variety of narrow-leafed lupin (L. angustifolius), obtained using eight different tissues and two different sequencing technologies. In addition, we present a list of 33 genes that are closely co-expressed with LDC and that represent strong candidates for involvement in lupin alkaloid biosynthesis. One of these genes encodes a copper amine oxidase able to convert the product of LDC, cadaverine, into 1-piperideine, as shown by heterologous expression and enzyme assays. Kinetic analysis revealed a low KM value for cadaverine, supporting a role as the second enzyme in the QA pathway. Our transcriptomic data set represents a crucial step towards the discovery of enzymes, transporters, and regulators involved in lupin alkaloid biosynthesis."

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) regulate cell cycle and transcriptional activity. Pan-CDK inhibitors demonstrated early efficacy in lymphoid malignancies, but also have been associated with narrow therapeutic index. Among transcriptional CDKs, CDK7 and CDK9 emerged as promising targets. CDK9 serves as a component of P-TEFb elongation complex and thus is indispensable in mRNA transcription. Selective CDK9 inhibitors demonstrated pre-clinical efficacy in in vitro and in vivo models of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CDK9 inhibition results in transcriptional pausing with rapid downmodulation of short-lived oncogenic proteins, e.g. Myc and Mcl-1, followed by cell apoptosis. Early phase clinical trials established safety of CDK9 inhibitors, with manageable neutropenia, infections and gastrointestinal toxicities. In this review, we summarize the rationale of targeting CDK9 in lymphoid malignancies, as well as pre-clinical and early clinical data with pan-CDK and selective CDK9 inhibitors."

Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 9 associates mainly with cyclin T1 and forms the positive transcription elongation factor b (p-TEFb) complex responsible for transcriptional regulation. It has been shown that CDK9 modulates the expression and activity of oncogenes, such as MYC and murine double minute 4 (MDM4), and it also plays an important role in development and/or maintenance of the malignant cell phenotype. Malfunction of CDK9 is frequently observed in numerous cancers. Recent studies have highlighted the function of CDK9 through a variety of mechanisms in cancers, including the formation of new complexes and epigenetic alterations. Due to the importance of CDK9 activation in cancer cells, CDK9 inhibitors have emerged as promising candidates for cancer therapy. Natural product-derived and chemically synthesized CDK9 inhibitors are being examined in preclinical and clinical research. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of CDK9 in transcriptional regulation, epigenetic regulation, and different cellular factor interactions, focusing on new advances. We show the importance of CDK9 in mediating tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Then, we provide an overview of some CDK9 inhibitors supported by multiple oncologic preclinical and clinical investigations. Finally, we discuss the perspective and challenge of CDK9 modulation in cancer."

Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs) are well-known reliable targets for cancer treatment being often deregulated.

Here we give an overview of some natural compounds identified as CDK inhibitors with reported activity also against CDK9, that were taken as a model for the development of highly active synthetic anti-CDK9 agents. After, we summarize the data on CDK9 inhibition in a group of rare pediatric solid tumors such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, synovial sarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumors (soft tissue sarcomas), highlighting the more recent results in this field.

Over the past decade and a half, the paradigm has emerged of cardiac hypertrophy and ensuing heart failure as fundamentally a problem in signal transduction, impinging on the altered expression or function of gene-specific transcription factors and their partners, which then execute the hypertrophic phenotype. Strikingly, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is itself a substrate for two protein kinases-the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk7 and Cdk9--that are activated by hypertrophic cues. Phosphorylation of RNAPII in the carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit controls a number of critical steps subsequent to transcription initiation, among them enabling RNAPII to overcome its stalling in the promoter-proximal region and to engage in efficient transcription elongation. Here, we summarize our current understanding of the RNAPII-directed protein kinases in cardiac hypertrophy. Cdk9 activation is essential in tissue culture for myocyte enlargement and sufficient in transgenic mice for hypertrophy to occur and yet is unrelated to the \"fetal\" gene program that is typical of pathophysiological heart growth. Although this trophic effect of Cdk9 appears benign superficially, pathophysiological levels of Cdk9 activity render myocardium remarkably susceptible to apoptotic stress. Cdk9 interacts adversely with Gq-dependent pathways for hypertrophy, impairing the expression of numerous genes for mitochondrial proteins, and, in particular, suppressing master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, perioxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1), and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1). Given the dual transcriptional roles of Cdk9 in hypertrophic growth and mitochondrial dysfunction, we suggest the potential usefulness of Cdk9 as a target in heart failure drug discovery."

The family of Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs) can be subdivided into two major functional groups based on their roles in cell cycle and/or transcriptional control. CDK9 is the catalytic subunit of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). CDK9 is the kinase of the TAK complex (Tat-associated kinase complex), and binds to Tat protein of HIV, suggesting a possible role for CDK9 in AIDS progression. CDK9 complexed with its regulatory partner cyclin T1, serves as a cellular mediator of the transactivation function of the HIV Tat protein. P-TEFb is responsible for the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA Pol II, resulting in stimulation of transcription. Furthermore, the complexes containing CDK9 induce the differentiation in distinct tissue. The CDK9/cyclin T1 complex is expressed at higher level in more differentiated primary neuroectodermal and neuroblastoma tumors, showing a correlation between the kinase expression and tumor differentiation grade. This may have clinical and therapeutical implications for these tumor types. Among the CDK inhibitors two have shown to be effective against CDK9: Roscovitine and Flavopiridol. These two inhibitors prevented the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 by blocking Tat transactivation of the HIV type 1 promoter. These compounds inhibit CDKs by binding to the catalytic domain in place of ATP, preventing transfer of a phosphate group to the substrate. More sensitive therapeutic agents of CDK9 can be designed, and structural studies can add information in the understanding of this kinase. The major features related to CDK9 inhibition will be reviewed in this article."

Cdk9 is the catalytic subunit of TAK (cyclinT1/P-TEFb), a cellular protein kinase that mediates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat transcriptional activation function. To examine Cdk9 function in cells relevant to HIV-1 infection, we used a murine leukemia virus retrovirus vector to transduce and overexpress the cDNA of a dominant negative mutant Cdk9 protein (Cdk9-dn) in Jurkat T cells and U937 promonocytic cells. In Jurkat cells, overexpression of Cdk9-dn specifically inhibited Tat transactivation and HIV-1 replication but had no inhibitory effect on induction of CD69, CD25, and interleukin-2 following T-cell activation. In U937 cells, overexpression of Cdk9-dn sensitized cells to apoptosis, especially after phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treatment to induce differentiation to macrophage-like cells. Because Cdk9 function is induced in PMA-treated U937 cells, Cdk9 may play an antiapoptotic role during monocyte differentiation."

The oligomerization chain reaction (OCR) strategy is a recently described technique for inactivation of target proteins that function as homoassociate complexes. This novel strategy is based on the fusion of self-associating coiled-coil (CC) domain of the nuclear factor promyelocytic leukemia (PML) to target proteins. Here, we present the successful application of the OCR strategy for inactivation of the heterodimeric Cdk9/cyclin T1 complex. Cyclin T1/Cdk9 (P-TEFb) complex is a positive regulator of gene transcription, whose function is underlined by the ability to phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II conferring productive transcript elongation. Fusion of the CC domain to Cdk9 leads to the formation of high molecular complexes to which the endogenous cyclin T1 is recruited. The CC-Cdk9 chimera effectively inhibits HIV-1 Tat activation, whose transcription activity is exquisitely dependent upon cyclin T1/Cdk9 function. Furthermore, expression of CC-Cdk9 protein inhibits cell proliferation, as shown by colony-formation assay. Collectively, our findings add further support to the OCR strategy for functional inactivation of hetero-associated factors such as the Cdk9/cyclin T1 complex, and highlight a putative function of Cdk9 in cell growth control."

Among CDKs, CDK9 is a validated pathological target in HIV infection, inflammation and cardiac hypertrophy; however selective CDK9 inhibitors are still not available. We present a selective inhibitor family of CDK9 based on the 4-phenylamino-6- phenylpyrimidine nucleus. We show a convenient synthetic method to prepare a useful intermediate and its derivatisation resulting in novel compounds. The CDK9 inhibitory activity of the derivatives was measured in specific kinase assay and the CDK inhibitory profile of the best ones (IC(50) < 100 nM) was determined. The most selective compounds had high selectivity over CDK1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and showed at least one order of magnitude higher inhibitory activity over CDK4 inhibition. The most selective molecules were examined in cytotoxicity assays and their ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication was determined in cellular assays."

CD96 is a member of the poliovirus receptor (PVR, CD155)-nectin family that includes T cell Ig and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and CD226. While CD96, TIGIT, and CD226 have important roles in regulating NK cell activity, and TIGIT and CD226 have also been shown to regulate T cell responses, it is unclear whether CD96 has inhibitory or stimulatory function in CD8+ T cells. Here, we demonstrate that CD96 has co-stimulatory function on CD8+ T cells. Crosslinking of CD96 on human or mouse CD8+ T cells induced activation, effector cytokine production, and proliferation. CD96 was found to transduce its activating signal through the MEK-ERK pathway. CD96-mediated signaling led to increased frequencies of NUR77- and T-bet-expressing CD8+ T cells and enhanced cytotoxic effector activity, indicating that CD96 can modulate effector T cell differentiation. Antibody blockade of CD96 or genetic ablation of CD96 expression on CD8+ T cells impaired expression of transcription factors and proinflammatory cytokines associated with CD8+ T cell activation in in vivo models. Taken together, CD96 has a co-stimulatory role in CD8+ T cell activation and effector function."
