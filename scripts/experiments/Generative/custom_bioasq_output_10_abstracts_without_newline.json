A sulfated glycoprotein was isolated from the culture media of Drosophila Kc cells and named papilin. Affinity purified antibodies against this protein localized it primarily to the basement membranes of embryos. The antibodies cross-reacted with another material which was not sulfated and appeared to be the core protein of papilin, which is proteoglycan-like. After reduction, papilin electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a broad band of about 900,000 apparent molecular weight and the core protein as a narrow band of approximately 400,000. The core protein was formed by some cell lines and by other cells on incubation with 1 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl xyloside, which inhibited formation of the proteoglycan-like form. The buoyant density of papilin in CsCl/4 M guanidine hydrochloride is 1.4 g/ml, that of the core protein is much less. Papilin forms oligomers linked by disulfide bridges, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The protomer is a 225 +/- 15-nm thread which is disulfide-linked into a loop with fine, protruding thread ends. Oligomers form clover-leaf-like structures. The protein contains 22% combined serine and threonine residues and 25% combined aspartic and glutamic residues. 10 g of polypeptide has attached 6.4 g of glucosamine, 3.1 g of galactosamine, 6.1 g of uronic acid, and 2.7 g of neutral sugars. There are about 80 O-linked carbohydrate chains/core protein molecule. Sulfate is attached to these chains. The O-linkage is through an unidentified neutral sugar. Papilin is largely resistant to common glycosidases and several proteases. The degree of sulfation varies with the sulfate concentration of the incubation medium. This proteoglycan-like glycoprotein differs substantially from corresponding proteoglycans found in vertebrate basement membranes, in contrast to Drosophila basement membrane laminin and collagen IV which have been conserved evolutionarily."

Two contrasting substrates, Drosophila laminin and human vitronectin, caused determined primary Drosophila embryo cells to follow alternate intermediate differentiation steps without affecting the final outcome of differentiation. Integrin alpha PS2 beta PS3 was essential for the initial spreading of myocytes on vitronectin: focal contacts rich in beta PS3 integrins formed and were connected by actin- and myosin-containing stress fibers. While alpha PS2 beta PS3 was unnecessary for myotube formation on laminin, it was required for the subsequent change to a sarcomeric cytoarchitecture. The differentiating primary cultures synthesized integrins and assembled them into detergent-insoluble, cytoskeleton-associated complexes. Collagen IV, laminin, glutactin, papilin, and other extracellular matrix proteins were made primarily by hemocytes and were secreted into the medium. Further differentiation within the cultures was influenced by secreted components and by later addition of vitronectin or bovine serum. Comparison of the differentiation of various cell types on the two substrates showed that vitronectin provided a selective advantage for the differentiation of myocytes, with enrichment over epithelia, epidermal cells, and neurites."

The organs of animal embryos are typically covered with an extracellular matrix (ECM) that must be carefully remodeled as these organs enlarge during post-embryonic growth; otherwise, their shape and functions may be compromised. We previously described the twisting of the Caenorhabditis elegans pharynx (here called the Twp phenotype) as a quantitative mutant phenotype that worsens as that organ enlarges during growth. Mutations previously known to cause pharyngeal twist affect membrane proteins with large extracellular domains (DIG-1 and SAX-7), as well as a C. elegans septin (UNC-61). Here we show that two novel alleles of the C. elegans papilin gene, mig-6(et4) and mig-6(sa580), can also cause the Twp phenotype. We also show that overexpression of the ADAMTS protease gene mig-17 can suppress the pharyngeal twist in mig-6 mutants and identify several alleles of other ECM-related genes that can cause or influence the Twp phenotype, including alleles of fibulin (fbl-1), perlecan (unc-52), collagens (cle-1, dpy-7), laminins (lam-1, lam-3), one ADAM protease (sup-17), and one ADAMTS protease (adt-1). The Twp phenotype in C. elegans is easily monitored using light microscopy, is quantitative via measurements of the torsion angle, and reveals that ECM components, metalloproteinases, and ECM attachment molecules are important for this organ to retain its correct shape during post-embryonic growth. The Twp phenotype is therefore a promising experimental system to study ECM remodeling and diseases."

The gonad arms of C. elegans hermaphrodites acquire invariant shapes by guided migrations of distal tip cells (DTCs), which occur in three phases that differ in the direction and basement membrane substrata used for movement. We found that mig-6 encodes long (MIG-6L) and short (MIG-6S) isoforms of the extracellular matrix protein papilin, each required for distinct aspects of DTC migration. Both MIG-6 isoforms have a predicted N-terminal papilin cassette, lagrin repeats and C-terminal Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitory domains. We show that mutations affecting MIG-6L specifically and cell-autonomously decrease the rate of post-embryonic DTC migration, mimicking a post-embryonic collagen IV deficit. We also show that MIG-6S has two separable functions - one in embryogenesis and one in the second phase of DTC migration. Genetic data suggest that MIG-6S functions in the same pathway as the MIG-17/ADAMTS metalloproteinase for guiding phase 2 DTC migrations, and MIG-17 is abnormally localized in mig-6 class-s mutants. Genetic data also suggest that MIG-6S and non-fibrillar network collagen IV play antagonistic roles to ensure normal phase 2 DTC guidance."

OBJECTIVES Suicidal ideation is an uncommon but worrisome symptom than can emerge during antidepressant treatment. We have described earlier the association between treatment-emergent suicidal ideation (TESI) and markers in genes encoding glutamate receptor subunits GRIK2 and GRIA3. The present genome-wide association study was conducted to identify additional genetic markers associated with TESI that may help identify individuals at high risk who may benefit from closer monitoring, alternative treatments, and/or specialty care. METHODS A clinically representative cohort of outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder enrolled in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial were treated with citalopram under a standard protocol for up to 14 weeks. DNA samples from 90 White participants who developed TESI and a sex-matched and race-matched equal number of treated participants who denied any suicidal ideas were genotyped with 109 365 single nucleotide polymorphisms on the Illumina's Human-1 BeadChip. RESULTS One marker was found to be associated with TESI in this sample at the experiment-wide adjusted P less than 0.05 level (marker rs11628713, allelic P = 6.2x10, odds ratio = 4.7, permutation P = 0.01). A second marker was associated at the experiment-wide adjusted P = 0.06 level (rs10903034, allelic P = 3.02x10, odds ratio = 2.7, permutation P = 0.06). These markers reside within the genes PAPLN and IL28RA, respectively. PAPLN encodes papilin, a protoglycan-like sulfated glycoprotein. IL28RA encodes an interleukin receptor. CONCLUSION Together with our earlier report, these findings may shed light on the biological basis of TESI and may help identify patients at increased risk of this potentially serious adverse event."

Papilins are extracellular matrix proteins that share a particular, common order of types of protein domains. They occur widely, from nematodes to man, and can differ in the number of repeats of a given type of domain. Protein variety is increased by differential splicing of pre-mRNA. We report that Drosophila, which has a compact genome, expresses three splice variants of papilin during embryogenesis in developmentally defined patterns. These isoforms have different numbers of Kunitz and IgC2 domains. The papilin isoforms are expressed in specific cell types and contribute to different extracellular matrices in gastrulation folds, early mesoderm, heart formation, basement membranes, and elaboration of the excorporeal peritrophic membrane that lines the gut. This finding indicates an unexpectedly broad spectrum of different pericellular matrices in Drosophila embryos. Such papilin-containing matrices have developmental as well as functional significance, as we previously showed that both suppression of papilin synthesis and ectopic overexpression lethally disrupt organogenesis."

Cell invasion through basement membrane is a specialized cellular behavior critical for many developmental processes and leukocyte trafficking. Invasive cellular behavior is also inappropriately co-opted during cancer progression. Acquisition of an invasive phenotype is accompanied by changes in gene expression that are thought to coordinate the steps of invasion. The transcription factors responsible for these changes in gene expression, however, are largely unknown. C. elegans anchor cell (AC) invasion is a genetically tractable in vivo model of invasion through basement membrane. AC invasion requires the conserved transcription factor FOS-1A, but other transcription factors are thought to act in parallel to FOS-1A to control invasion. Here we identify the transcription factor HLH-2, the C. elegans ortholog of Drosophila Daughterless and vertebrate E proteins, as a regulator of AC invasion. Reduction of HLH-2 function by RNAi or with a hypomorphic allele causes defects in AC invasion. Genetic analysis indicates that HLH-2 has functions outside of the FOS-1A pathway. Using expression analysis, we identify three genes that are transcriptionally regulated by HLH-2: the protocadherin cdh-3, and two genes encoding secreted extracellular matrix proteins, mig-6/papilin and him-4/hemicentin. Further, we show that reduction of HLH-2 function causes defects in polarization of F-actin to the invasive cell membrane, a process required for the AC to generate protrusions that breach the basement membrane. This work identifies HLH-2 as a regulator of the invasive phenotype in the AC, adding to our understanding of the transcriptional networks that control cell invasion."

Determination of its cDNA sequence led to the identification of Caenorhabditis and mammalian papilins.

In vitro, papilin non-competitively inhibits procollagen N-proteinase, an ADAMTS metalloproteinase. Inhibiting papilin synthesis in Drosophila or Caenorhabditis causes defective cell arrangements and embryonic death. Ectopic expression of papilin in Drosophila causes lethal abnormalities in muscle, Malpighian tubule and trachea formation. We suggest that papilin influences cell rearrangements and may modulate metalloproteinases during organogenesis."

Receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are cytokines predominantly secreted by osteoblasts and play a central role in differentiation and functional activation of osteoclasts.

After 12-week interventions, the results showed that PEMF increased serum 17\u03b2-estradiol level, reduced serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase level, increased bone mineral density, and inhibited deterioration of bone microarchitecture and strength in OVX rats. Furthermore, PEMF could suppress RANKL expression and improve OPG expression in bone marrow cells of OVX rats.

Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB-ligand (RANKL), encoded by the gene TNFSF11, is required for osteoclastogenesis, and its expression is upregulated in pathologic bone loss. Transcript variants of TNFSF11 messenger RNA (mRNA) have been described that encode a membrane-bound and a putative secreted form of RANKL. We identify a TNFSF11 transcript variant that extends the originally identified transcript encoding secreted RANKL. We demonstrate that this TNFSF11 transcript variant is expressed by the human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, and by both primary human T cells and Jurkat T cells. Of relevance to the production of RANKL in pathologic bone loss, expression of this secreted TNFSF11 transcript is upregulated in Jurkat T cells and primary human T cells upon activation. Furthermore, this transcript can be translated and secreted in Jurkat T cells in vitro and is able to support osteoclast differentiation. Our data highlight the complexity of the TNFSF11 genomic locus, and demonstrate the potential for the expression of alternate mRNA transcripts encoding membrane-bound and secreted forms of RANKL. Implications of alternate mRNA transcripts encoding different RANKL protein isoforms should be carefully considered and specifically examined in future studies, particularly those implicating RANKL in pathologic bone loss."

Although T lymphocytes (LTs) are considered important to control infection, the mechanism of Brucella-induced T-cell responses to immunopathological features is not known. We present in vitro and in vivo evidence showing that Brucella abortus-induced inflammatory response leads to the activation of LTs, which further promote osteoclastogenesis. Pre-activated murine LTs treated with culture supernatant from macrophages infected with B. abortus induced bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMMs) to undergo osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, osteoclastogenesis was mediated by CD4(+) T cells. Although B. abortus-activated T cells actively secreted the pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines RANKL and IL-17, osteoclastogenesis depended on IL-17, because osteoclast generation induced by Brucella-activated T cells was completely abrogated when these cells were cultured with BMMs from IL-17 receptor knockout mice. Neutralization experiments indicated that IL-6, generated by Brucella infection, induced the production of pro-osteoclastogenic IL-17 from LTs. By using BMMs from tumor necrosis factor receptor p55 knockout mice, we also demonstrated that IL-17 indirectly induced osteoclastogenesis through the induction of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 from osteoclast precursors. Finally, extensive and widespread osteoclastogenesis was observed in the knee joints of mice injected with Brucella-activated T cells.

Zebrafish scales consist of bone-forming osteoblasts, bone-resorbing osteoclasts, and calcified bone matrix. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of the effects induced by dynamic and static acceleration, we investigated the scale osteoblast- and osteoclast-specific marker gene expression involving osteoblast-osteoclast communication molecules. Osteoblasts express RANKL, which binds to the osteoclast surface receptor, RANK, and stimulates bone resorption. OPG, on the other hand, is secreted by osteoblast as a decoy receptor for RANKL, prevents RANKL from binding to RANK and thus prevents bone resorption. Therefore, the RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway contributes to the regulation of osteoclastogenesis by osteoblasts. Semaphorin 4D, in contrast, is expressed on osteoclasts, and binding to its receptor Plexin-B1 on osteoblasts results in suppression of bone formation. In the present study, we found that both dynamic and static acceleration at 3.0\u00d7g decreased RANKL/OPG ratio and increased osteoblast-specific functional mRNA such as alkaline phosphatase, while static acceleration increased and dynamic acceleration decreased osteoclast-specific mRNA such as cathepsin K.

However, an 110 kda band was not found in TPA-treated media of MG-63 cells. Cystamine, a Tgase-2 inhibitor, dose-dependently suppressed the expression of OPG in MG-63 cells.

However, we could not fi nd the isopeptide bond at 110 kda but 77 kda, which is believed to be the band position of Tgase-2. This suggested that 110 kda is not the direct product of Tgase-2's action.

OPG has been reported to attenuate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells, including OC cells. OPG-mediated protection against TRAIL has been attributed to its decoy receptor function. However, OPG activates integrin/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling in endothelial cells. In OC cells, activation of integrin/FAK signaling inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that OPG could attenuate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in OC cells through integrin/FAK signaling. METHODS In vitro experiments including immunoblots, colony formation assays, and apoptosis measurements were used to assess the effect of OPG on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. RESULTS Exogenous OPG protected from TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a TRAIL binding-independent manner and OPG protection was \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin/FAK signaling-dependent. Moreover, OPG-mediated activation of integrin/FAK signaling resulted in the activation of Akt. Inhibition of both integrin/FAK and Akt signaling significantly inhibited OPG-mediated attenuation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Although OPG also stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling did not significantly altered OPG protection. CONCLUSIONS Our studies provide evidence, for the first time, that OPG can attenuate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a TRAIL binding-independent manner through the activation of integrin/FAK/Akt signaling in OC cells."

Bone destruction is a common feature of inflammatory arthritis and is mediated by osteoclasts, the only specialized cells to carry out bone resorption. Aberrant expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa \u03b2 ligand (RANKL), an inducer of osteoclast differentiation has been linked with bone pathology and the synovial fibroblast in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this manuscript, we challenge the current concept that an increase in RANKL expression governs osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction in autoimmune arthritis. We isolated human fibroblasts from RA, pyrophosphate arthropathy (PPA) and osteoarthritis (OA) patients and analyzed their RANKL/OPG expression profile and the capacity of their secreted factors to induce osteoclastogenesis. We determined a 10-fold increase of RANKL mRNA and protein in fibroblasts isolated from RA relative to PPA and OA patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers were cultured in the presence of RA, PPA and OA synovial fibroblast conditioned medium. Osteoclast differentiation was assessed by expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), vitronectin receptor (VNR), F-actin ring formation and bone resorption assays. The formation of TRAP(+), VNR(+) multinucleated cells, capable of F-actin ring formation and lacunar resorption in synovial fibroblast conditioned medium cultures occured in the presence of osteoprotegerin (OPG) a RANKL antagonist. Osteoclasts did not form in these cultures in the absence of macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). Our data suggest that the conditioned medium of pure synovial fibroblast cultures contain inflammatory mediators that can induce osteoclast formation in human PBMC independently of RANKL. Moreover inhibition of the TNF or IL-6 pathway was not sufficient to abolish osteoclastogenic signals derived from arthritic synovial fibroblasts. Collectively, our data clearly show that alternate osteoclastogenic pathways exist in inflammatory arthritis and place the synovial fibroblast as a key regulatory cell in bone and joint destruction, which is a hallmark of autoimmune arthritis."

Extracellular ATP is an important signaling molecule throughout the inflammatory cascade, serving as a danger signal that causes activation of the inflammasome, enhancement of immune cell infiltration, and fine-tuning of several signaling cascades including those important for the resolution of inflammation. Recent studies demonstrated that ATP can be released from cells in a controlled manner through pannexin (Panx) channels. Panx1-mediated ATP release is involved in inflammasome activation and neutrophil/macrophage chemotaxis, activation of T cells, and a role for Panx1 in inducing and propagating inflammation has been demonstrated in various organs, including lung and the central and peripheral nervous system. The recognition and clearance of dying cells and debris from focal points of inflammation is critical in the resolution of inflammation, and Panx1-mediated ATP release from dying cells has been shown to recruit phagocytes. Moreover, extracellular ATP can be broken down by ectonucleotidases into ADP, AMP, and adenosine, which is critical in the resolution of inflammation. Together, Panx1, ATP, purinergic receptors, and ectonucleotidases contribute to important feedback loops during the inflammatory response, and thus represent promising candidates for new therapies."

Pannexin1 (Panx1) participates in several signaling events that involve adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release, including the innate immune response, ciliary beat in airway epithelia, and oxygen supply in the vasculature. The view that Panx1 forms a large ATP release channel has been challenged by the association of a low-conductance, small anion-selective channel with the presence of Panx1. We showed that Panx1 membrane channels can function in two distinct modes with different conductances and permeabilities when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. When stimulated by potassium ions (K(+)), Panx1 formed a high-conductance channel of ~500 pS that was permeable to ATP. Various physiological stimuli can induce this ATP-permeable conformation of the channel in several cell types. In contrast, the channel had a low conductance (~50 pS) with no detectable ATP permeability when activated by voltage in the absence of K(+). The two channel states were associated with different reactivities of the terminal cysteine of Panx1 to thiol reagents, suggesting different conformations. Single-particle electron microscopic analysis revealed that K(+) stimulated the formation of channels with a larger pore diameter than those formed in the absence of K(+). These data suggest that different stimuli lead to distinct channel structures with distinct biophysical properties."

The affinity of the ATP binding site is lower than that of the purinergic P2X7 receptor allowing a transient activation of Panx1 by ATP through P2X7R. Here we show that the inhibition of Panx1 by ATP is abrogated by increased extracellular potassium ion concentration ([K(+)]o) in a dose-dependent manner. Since increased [K(+)]o is also a stimulus for Panx1 channels, it can be expected that a combination of ATP and increased [K(+)]o would be deadly for cells. Indeed, astrocytes did not survive exposure to these combined stimuli. The death mechanism, although involving P2X7R, does not appear to strictly follow a pyroptotic pathway. Instead, caspase-3 was activated, a process inhibited by Panx1 inhibitors. These data suggest that Panx1 plays an early role in the cell death signaling pathway involving ATP and K(+) ions.

Pannexins are topologically related to connexins and innexins, but serve different functional roles than forming gap junctions. We previously showed that pannexins form oligomeric channels but unlike connexins and innexins, they form only single membrane channels. High levels of Panx2 mRNA and protein in the Central Nervous System (CNS) have been documented. Whereas Pannexin1 (Panx1) is fairly ubiquitous and Pannexin3 (Panx3) is found in skin and connective tissue, both are fully glycosylated, traffic to the plasma membrane and have functions correlated with extracellular ATP release. Here, we describe trafficking and subcellular localizations of exogenous Panx2 and Panx1 protein expression in MDCK, HeLa, and HEK 293T cells as well as endogenous Panx1 and Panx2 patterns in the CNS. Panx2 was found in intracellular localizations, was partially N-glycosylated, and localizations were non-overlapping with Panx1. Confocal images of hippocampal sections immunolabeled for the astrocytic protein GFAP, Panx1 and Panx2 demonstrated that the two isoforms, Panx1 and Panx2, localized at different subcellular compartments in both astrocytes and neurons. Using recombinant fusions of Panx2 with appended genetic tags developed for correlated light and electron microscopy and then expressed in different cell lines, we determined that Panx2 is localized in the membrane of intracellular vesicles and not in the endoplasmic reticulum as initially indicated by calnexin colocalization experiments. Dual immunofluorescence imaging with protein markers for specific vesicle compartments showed that Panx2 vesicles are early endosomal in origin. In electron tomographic volumes, cross-sections of these vesicles displayed fine structural details and close proximity to actin filaments. Thus, pannexins expressed at different subcellular compartments likely exert distinct functional roles, particularly in the nervous system."

Six of them form a \"gap junction hemichannel-like\" structure that connects the cytoplasm with the extracellular space; here they will be called Panx1 channels. These are poorly selective channels permeable to ions, small metabolic substrate, and signaling molecules. So far little is known about the role of Panx1 channels in muscles but skeletal muscles of Panx1(-/-) mice do not show an evident phenotype. Innervated adult fast and slow skeletal myofibers show Panx1 reactivity in close proximity to dihydropyridine receptors in the sarcolemma of T-tubules. These Panx1 channels are activated by electrical stimulation and extracellular ATP. Panx1 channels play a relevant role in potentiation of muscle contraction because they allow release of ATP and uptake of glucose, two molecules required for this response. In support of this notion, the absence of Panx1 abrogates the potentiation of muscle contraction elicited by repetitive electrical stimulation, which is reversed by exogenously applied ATP. Phosphorylation of Panx1 Thr and Ser residues might be involved in Panx1 channel activation since it is enhanced during potentiation of muscle contraction. Under denervation, Panx1 levels are upregulated and this partially explains the reduction in electrochemical gradient, however its absence does not prevent denervation-induced atrophy but prevents the higher oxidative state. Panx1 also forms functional channels at the cell surface of myotubes and their functional state has been associated with intracellular Ca(2+) signals and regulation of myotube plasticity evoked by electrical stimulation. We proposed that Panx1 channels participate as ATP channels and help to keep a normal oxidative state in skeletal muscles."

In the present study, we identified and characterized a Panx1 homolog cDNA, termed poPanx1, from Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus, which is one of the most important economic mariculture fish species in China. PoPanx1 is a membrane protein that is composed of 437 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 48.7 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.46. The poPanx1 mRNA ubiquitously expresses in all examined tissues but with predominant expression in hepatopancreas in unstimulated healthy adult Japanese flounder. In Japanese flounder head kidney primary cells, poPanx1 gene expression could be significantly induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs; polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid and bacterial endotoxin LPS) stimulations. In vivo experiments revealed that poPanx1 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated upon immune challenges with Edwardsiella tarda and Vibrio anguillarum. Furthermore, we showed that poPanx1 is an important channel protein for PAMP-induced extracellular ATP release that is required for activation of purinergic signaling in fish innate immunity.

Functional channels were not formed following mutation of a single amino acid within a conserved protein motif recently shown to be N-glycosylated in rodent Panx1.

Homology searches strongly support the presence of pannexin sequences in cartilaginous fish and provide evidence that pannexins evolved when urochordata and chordata evolution split. Further, we confirm Panx1 ohnologs being solely present in teleosts. A hallmark of differential expression of drPanx1a and drPanx1b in various zebrafish brain areas is the non-overlapping protein localization of drPanx1a in the outer and drPanx1b in the inner fish retina. A functional comparison of the evolutionary distant fish and mouse Panx1s revealed both, preserved and unique properties. Preserved functions are the capability to form channels opening at resting potential, which are sensitive to known gap junction and hemichannel blockers, intracellular calcium, extracellular ATP and pH changes. However, drPanx1b is unique due to its highly complex glycosylation pattern and distinct electrophysiological gating kinetics.

Interestingly, several hypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named 'hypoxia-induced noncoding ultraconserved transcripts' (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical samples from colon cancer patients. We show that these T-UCRs are predominantly nuclear and that the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is at least partly responsible for the induction of several members of this group. One specific HINCUT, uc.475 (or HINCUT-1) is part of a retained intron of the host protein-coding gene, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase, which is overexpressed in epithelial cancer types. Consistent with the hypothesis that T-UCRs have important function in tumor formation, HINCUT-1 supports cell proliferation specifically under hypoxic conditions and may be critical for optimal O-GlcNAcylation of proteins when oxygen tension is limiting.

BACKGROUND Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are highly constrained elements of mammalian genomes, whose functional role has not been completely elucidated yet. Previous studies have shown that some of them act as enhancers in mouse, while some others are expressed in both normal and cancer-derived human tissues. Only one UCE element so far was shown to present these two functions concomitantly, as had been observed in other isolated instances of single, non ultraconserved enhancer elements. RESULTS We used a custom microarray to assess the levels of UCE transcription during mouse development and integrated these data with published microarray and next-generation sequencing datasets as well as with newly produced PCR validation experiments. We show that a large fraction of non-exonic UCEs is transcribed across all developmental stages examined from only one DNA strand. Although the nature of these transcripts remains a mistery, our meta-analysis of RNA-Seq datasets indicates that they are unlikely to be short RNAs and that some of them might encode nuclear transcripts. In the majority of cases this function overlaps with the already established enhancer function of these elements during mouse development. Utilizing several next-generation sequencing datasets, we were further able to show that the level of expression observed in non-exonic UCEs is significantly higher than in random regions of the genome and that this is also seen in other regions which act as enhancers. CONCLUSION Our data shows that the concurrent presence of enhancer and transcript function in non-exonic UCE elements is more widespread than previously shown. Moreover through our own experiments as well as the use of next-generation sequencing datasets, we were able to show that the RNAs encoded by non-exonic UCEs are likely to be long RNAs transcribed from only one DNA strand."

The importance of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) and transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) as altered elements in neoplasia, is also gaining recognition.

We focused on the small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), a subset of ncRNA with a wide variety of cellular functions, such as chemical modification of RNA, pre-RNA processing and control of alternative splicing. By data mining snoRNA databases and the scientific literature, we selected 49 snoRNAs that had a CpG island within \u2264 2 Kb or that were processed from a host gene with a 5'-CpG island. Bisulfite genomic sequencing of multiple clones in normal colon mucosa and the colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116 showed that 46 snoRNAs were equally methylated in the two samples: completely unmethylated (n = 26) or fully methylated (n = 20). Most interestingly, the host gene-associated 5'-CpG islands of the snoRNAs SNORD123, U70C and ACA59B were hypermethylated in the cancer cells but not in the corresponding normal tissue. CpG island hypermethylation was associated with the transcriptional silencing of the respective snoRNAs. Results of a DNA methylation microarray platform in a comprehensive collection of normal tissues, cancer cell lines and primary malignancies demonstrated that the observed hypermethylation of snoRNAs was a common feature of various tumor types, particularly in leukemias.

Ultraconserved regions are noncoding genomic segments that are 100% conserved across humans, mice, and rats. Conservation of gene sequences across species may indicate an essential functional role, and therefore we evaluated the expression of ultraconserved RNAs (ucRNA) in hepatocellular cancer (HCC). The global expression of ucRNAs was analyzed with a custom microarray. Expression was verified in cell lines by real-time PCR or in tissues by in situ hybridization using tissue microarrays. Cellular ucRNA expression was modulated with siRNAs, and the effects on global gene expression and growth of human and murine HCC cells were evaluated. Fifty-six ucRNAs were aberrantly expressed in HepG2 cells compared with nonmalignant hepatocytes. Among these ucRNAs, the greatest change was noted for ultraconserved element 338 (uc.338), which was dramatically increased in human HCC compared with noncancerous adjacent tissues. Although uc.338 is partially located within the poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) gene, the transcribed ncRNA encoding uc.338 is expressed independently of PCBP2 and was cloned as a 590-bp RNA gene, termed TUC338. Functional gene annotation analysis indicated predominant effects on genes involved in cell growth. These effects were experimentally demonstrated in both human and murine cells. siRNA to TUC338 decreased both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of HCC cells. These studies identify a critical role for TUC338 in regulation of transformed cell growth and of transcribed ultraconserved ncRNA as a unique class of genes involved in the pathobiology of HCC."

Ultraconservation has been variously defined to describe sequences that have remained identical or nearly so over long periods of evolution to a degree that is higher than expected for sequences under typical constraints associated with protein-coding sequences, splice sites, or transcription factor binding sites. Most intergenic ultraconserved elements (UCE) appear to be tissue-specific enhancers, whereas another class of intragenic UCEs is involved in regulation of gene expression by means of alternative splicing. In this study we define a set of 2827 short ultraconserved promoter regions (SUPR) in 5 kb upstream regions of 1268 human protein-coding genes using a definition of 98% identity for at least 30 bp in 7 mammalian species. Our analysis shows that SUPRs are enriched in genes playing a role in regulation and development. Many of the genes having a SUPR-containing promoter have additional alternative promoters that do not contain SUPRs. Comparison of such promoters by CAGE tag, EST, and Solexa read analysis revealed that SUPR-associated transcripts show a significantly higher mean expression than transcripts associated with non-SUPR-containing promoters. The same was true for the comparison between all SUPR-associated and non-SUPR-associated transcripts on a genome-wide basis. SUPR-associated genes show a highly significant tendency to occur in regions that are also enriched for intergenic short ultraconserved elements (SUE) in the vicinity of developmental genes. A number of predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are overrepresented in SUPRs and SUEs, including those for transcription factors of the homeodomain family, but in contrast to SUEs, SUPRs are also enriched in core-promoter motifs. These observations suggest that SUPRs delineate a distinct class of ultraconserved sequences."

The identification of ultraconserved noncoding sequences in vertebrates has been associated with developmental regulators and DNA-binding proteins. One of the first of these was identified in the intergenic region between the Dlx-5 and Dlx-6 genes, members of the Dlx/dll homeodomain-containing protein family. In previous experiments, we showed that Sonic hedgehog treatment of forebrain neural explants results in the activation of Dlx-2 and the novel noncoding RNA (ncRNA), Evf-1. In this report, we show that the Dlx-5/6 ultraconserved region is transcribed to generate an alternatively spliced form of Evf-1, the ncRNA Evf-2. Evf-2 specifically cooperates with Dlx-2 to increase the transcriptional activity of the Dlx-5/6 enhancer in a target and homeodomain-specific manner. A stable complex containing the Evf-2 ncRNA and the Dlx-2 protein forms in vivo, suggesting that the Evf-2 ncRNA activates transcriptional activity by directly influencing Dlx-2 activity. These experiments identify a novel mechanism whereby transcription is controlled by the cooperative actions of an ncRNA and a homeodomain protein. The possibility that a subset of vertebrate ultraconserved regions may function at both the DNA and RNA level to control key developmental regulators may explain why ultraconserved sequences exhibit 90% or more conservation even after 450 million years of vertebrate evolution."

Co-option of cis-regulatory modules has been suggested as a mechanism for the evolution of expression sites during development. However, the extent and mechanisms involved in mobilization of cis-regulatory modules remains elusive. To trace the history of non-coding elements, which may represent candidate ancestral cis-regulatory modules affirmed during chordate evolution, we have searched for conserved elements in tunicate and vertebrate (Olfactores) genomes. We identified, for the first time, 183 non-coding sequences that are highly conserved between the two groups. Our results show that all but one element are conserved in non-syntenic regions between vertebrate and tunicate genomes, while being syntenic among vertebrates. Nevertheless, in all the groups, they are significantly associated with transcription factors showing specific functions fundamental to animal development, such as multicellular organism development and sequence-specific DNA binding. The majority of these regions map onto ultraconserved elements and we demonstrate that they can act as functional enhancers within the organism of origin, as well as in cross-transgenesis experiments, and that they are transcribed in extant species of Olfactores. We refer to the elements as 'Olfactores conserved non-coding elements'."

OBJECTIVES To verify the involvement of NKX2-1 gene in infants with brain-lung-thyroid (BLT) syndrome and hypothyroid phenotypes variable among congenital hypothyroidism (CH) or idiopathic mild hypothyroidism (IMH) of postnatal onset. METHODS The candidates were selected by a case-finding approach in 130 CH and 53 IMH infants. The NKX2-1 gene was analyzed by direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. The variants were studied in vitro, by expression analyses and luciferase bioassay. RESULTS Four cases (3 CH and 1 IMH) consistent with BLT syndrome were identified. Two children were affected with respiratory distress and CH, but wild-type NKX2-1 gene. The remaining two presented choreic movements and no pulmonary involvement, but discrepant thyroid phenotypes: one had severe CH with lingual ectopy and the other one IMH with gland in situ. They were carriers of new de novo heterozygous frameshift mutations of NKX2-1 (c.177delG and c.153_166del14). The c.177delG leads to a prematurely truncated protein (p.H60TfsX11) with undetectable activity in vitro. The c.153_166del14 leads to the generation of an elongated aberrant protein (p.A52RfsX351) able to translocate into the nucleus, but completely inactive on a responsive promoter. CONCLUSIONS Two novel heterozygous frameshift mutations of NKX2-1 were identified in 2 cases selected on the basis of a BLT-like phenotype among 183 hypothyroid infants. The atypical hypothyroid phenotypes of these 2 children (CH with lingual ectopy or IMH of postnatal onset) further expand the clinical spectrum that can be associated with NKX2-1 mutations."

RESULTS Direct sequencing revealed two heterozygous mutations. Using MLPA, we identified two further heterozygous NKX2.1 gene deletions. MLPA increased the detection rate by 50%. All patients with gene deletions identified were affected by BHC and congenital hypothyroidism. CONCLUSION MLPA should be considered as a complementary tool in patients with partial or total brain-lung-thyroid syndrome when direct sequencing failed to identify NKX2.1 mutations.

METHOD Clinical data from individuals with benign hereditary chorea identified through paediatric neurology services were collected in a standardized format. The NKX2.1 gene was analysed by Sanger sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and microarray analysis. RESULTS Six of our cohort were female and four male, median age at assessment was 8 years 6 months (range 1 y 6 mo-18 y).

To characterize the spectrum of associated pulmonary phenotypes, we identified individuals with mutations in NKX2-1 whose primary manifestation was respiratory disease. METHODS Retrospective and prospective approaches identified infants and children with unexplained diffuse lung disease for NKX2-1 sequencing. Histopathologic results and electron micrographs were assessed, and immunohistochemical analysis for surfactant-associated proteins was performed in a subset of 10 children for whom lung tissue was available. RESULTS We identified 16 individuals with heterozygous missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations and five individuals with heterozygous, whole-gene deletions of NKX2-1. Neonatal RDS was the presenting pulmonary phenotype in 16 individuals (76%), interstitial lung disease in four (19%), and pulmonary fibrosis in one adult family member. Altogether, 12 individuals (57%) had the full triad of neurologic, thyroid, and respiratory manifestations, but five (24%) had only pulmonary symptoms at the time of presentation. Recurrent respiratory infections were a prominent feature in nine subjects. Lung histopathology demonstrated evidence of disrupted surfactant homeostasis in the majority of cases, and at least five cases had evidence of disrupted lung growth.

The objectives of the present study were (i) detection of NKX2-1 mutations in patients with CH associated with pneumopathy and/or BHC, (ii) functional analysis of new mutations in vitro and (iii) description of the phenotypic spectrum of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. We identified three new heterozygous missense mutations (L176V, P202L, Q210P), a splice site mutation (376-2A-->G), and one deletion of NKX2-1 at 14q13. Functional analysis of the three missense mutations revealed loss of transactivation capacity on the human thyroglobulin enhancer/promoter. Interestingly, we showed that deficient transcriptional activity of NKX2-1-P202L was completely rescued by cotransfected PAX8-WT, whereas the synergistic effect was abolished by L176V and Q210P. The clinical spectrum of 6 own and 40 published patients with NKX2-1 mutations ranged from the complete triad of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome (50%), brain and thyroid disease (30%), to isolated BHC (13%).

Haploinsufficiency of NKX2.1, the gene encoding the thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)--critical for lung, thyroid and central nervous system morphogenesis and function--causes a rare form of progressive respiratory failure designated brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. Molecular mechanisms involved in this syndrome are heterogeneous and poorly explored. We report a novel TTF-1 molecular defect causing recurrent respiratory failure episodes in an infant. METHODS The subject was an infant with severe neonatal respiratory distress syndrome followed by recurrent respiratory failure episodes, hypopituitarism and neurological abnormalities. Lung histology and ultrastructure were assessed by surgical biopsy. Surfactant-related genes were studied by direct genomic DNA sequencing and array chromatine genomic hybridization (aCGH). Surfactant protein expression in lung tissue was analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. For kinetics studies, surfactant protein B and disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) were isolated from serial tracheal aspirates after intravenous administration of stable isotope-labeled (2)H(2)O and (13)C-leucine; fractional synthetic rate was derived from gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (2)H and (13)C enrichment curves. Six intubated infants with no primary lung disease were used as controls. RESULTS Lung biopsy showed desquamative interstitial pneumonitis and lamellar body abnormalities suggestive of genetic surfactant deficiency. Genetic studies identified a heterozygous ABCA3 mutation, L941P, previously unreported. No SFTPB, SFTPC or NKX2.1 mutations or deletions were found. However, immunofluorescence studies showed TTF-1 prevalently expressed in type II cell cytoplasm instead of nucleus, indicating defective nuclear targeting. This pattern has not been reported in human and was not found in two healthy controls and in five ABCA3 mutation carriers. Kinetic studies demonstrated a marked reduction of SP-B synthesis (43.2 vs. 76.5 \u00b1 24.8%/day); conversely, DSPC synthesis was higher (12.4 vs. 6.3 \u00b1 0.5%/day) compared to controls, although there was a marked reduction of DSPC content in tracheal aspirates (29.8 vs. 56.1 \u00b1 12.4% of total phospholipid content). CONCLUSION Defective TTF-1 signaling may result in profound surfactant homeostasis disruption and neonatal/pediatric diffuse lung disease. Heterozygous ABCA3 missense mutations may act as disease modifiers in other genetic surfactant defects."

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors at different doses in randomized double blind clinical trials. METHODS This meta-analysis was conducted by including randomized double-blind controlled trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes irrespective of their antidiabetic drug exposure history but with an inadequate glycemic control. All the effect sizes were computed using the random effects model. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (OR) were computed for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Additional analyses like sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were also performed. RESULTS The pooled analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in mean changes in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (SMD = -0.78%, 95% CI, -0.87 to -0.69), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (SMD = -0.70 mg/dl, 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.61), body weight (overall SMD = -0.59 kg, 95% CI, -0.65 to -0.52) and blood pressure from baseline with SGLT2 inhibitors based therapy.

Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to glucosuria and provides a unique mechanism to lower elevated blood glucose levels in diabetes.

Published articles, press releases, and abstracts presented at national and international meetings were considered. RESULTS SGLT2 inhibitors correct a novel pathophysiological defect, have an insulin-independent action, are efficacious with glycosylated hemoglobin reduction ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, promote weight loss, have a low incidence of hypoglycemia, complement the action of other antidiabetic agents, and can be used at any stage of diabetes. They are generally well tolerated. However, due to side effects, such as repeated urinary tract and genital infections, increased hematocrit, and decreased blood pressure, appropriate patient selection for drug initiation and close monitoring after initiation will be important. Results of ongoing clinical studies of the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on diabetic complications and cardiovascular safety are crucial to determine the risk-benefit ratio. A recent decision by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency has recommended approval of dapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and exercise, in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products, including insulin, and as a monotherapy for metformin-intolerant patients. Clinical research also remains to be carried out on the long-term effects of glucosuria and other potential effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, especially in view of the observed increase in the incidence of bladder and breast cancer. SGLT2 inhibitors represent a promising approach for the treatment of diabetes, and could potentially be an addition to existing therapies."

AIMS Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common clinical problem in diabetic patients; however, the relationship between UTI and glucosuria remains uncertain. To investigate the relationship, we examined the effect of glucosuria induced by sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on the progression of UTI in mice. METHODS From 1 day before transurethral inoculation with Candida albicans, female mice were treated orally once a day with an SGLT2 inhibitor in different treatment regimens: (i) dapagliflozin at 10 mg/kg for 2, 3 or 7 days, (ii) dapagliflozin at 0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg for 3 days and (iii) dapagliflozin, canagliflozin or tofogliflozin at 10 mg/kg for 3 days. To evaluate the ascending UTI, the kidneys were removed 6 days after the inoculation, and the number of viable C. albicans cells in kidney was measured as colony-forming units (CFU). RESULTS In mice treated with dapagliflozin, the number of C. albicans CFU in kidney increased in accordance with both treatment duration and dose. The number of CFU significantly increased when mice were treated with 10 mg/kg dapagliflozin or canagliflozin but not tofogliflozin. With dapagliflozin and canagliflozin, urine glucose concentration (UGC) significantly increased up to 24 h after drug administration; with tofogliflozin, UGC significantly increased only up to 12 h after drug administration. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that increased susceptibility to UTI is associated with a persistent increase in UGC."

The available oral anti-diabetic drugs act on many different molecular sites. The most used of oral anti-diabetic agents is metformin that activates glucose transport vesicles to the cell surface. Others are: the sulphonylureas; agents acting on the incretin system; GLP-1 agonists; dipetidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors; meglinitide analogues; and the thiazolidinediones. Despite these many drugs acting by different mechanisms, glycaemic control often remains elusive. None of these drugs have a primary renal mechanism of action on the kidneys, where almost all glucose excreted is normally reabsorbed. That is where the inhibitors of glucose reuptake (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, SGLT2) have a unique site of action. Promotion of urinary loss of glucose by SGLT2 inhibitors embodies a new principle of control in type 2 diabetes that has several advantages with some urogenital side-effects, both of which are evaluated in this review. Specific approvals include use as monotherapy, when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom the use of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications, or as add-on therapy with other anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products including insulin, when these together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycemic control. The basic mechanisms are improved \u03b2-cell function and insulin sensitivity. When compared with sulphonylureas or other oral antidiabetic agents, SGLT2 inhibitors provide greater HbA1c reduction. Urogenital side-effects related to the enhanced glycosuria can be troublesome, yet seldom lead to discontinuation. On this background, studies are analysed that compare SGLT2 inhibitors with other oral antidiabetic agents. Their unique mode of action, unloading the excess glycaemic load, contrasts with other oral agents that all act to counter the effects of diabetic hyperglycaemia."

Management of hypertension in diabetes is critical for reduction of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. While blood pressure (BP) control has improved over the past two decades, the control rate is still well below 50% in the general population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A new class of oral glucose-lowering agents has recently been approved; the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which act by eliminating large amounts of glucose in the urine. Two agents, dapagliflozin and canagliflozin, are currently approved in the United States and Europe, and empagliflozin and ipragliflozin have reported Phase 3 trials. In addition to glucose lowering, SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with weight loss and act as osmotic diuretics, resulting in a lowering of BP. While not approved for BP-lowering, they may potentially aid BP goal achievement in people within 7-10 mm Hg of goal. It should be noted that the currently approved agents have side effects that include an increased incidence of genital infections, predominantly in women. The approved SGLT2 inhibitors have limited use based on kidney function and should be used only in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for dapagliflozin and \u226545 mL/min/1.73 m2 for canagliflozin.

Inhibitors of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) are proposed as a novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several compounds are already available in many countries (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin and ipragliflozin) and some others are in a late phase of development. The available SGLT2 inhibitors share similar pharmacokinetic characteristics, with a rapid oral absorption, a long elimination half-life allowing once-daily administration, an extensive hepatic metabolism mainly via glucuronidation to inactive metabolites, the absence of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions and a low renal elimination as parent drug. SGLT2 co-transporters are responsible for reabsorption of most (90 %) of the glucose filtered by the kidneys. The pharmacological inhibition of SGLT2 co-transporters reduces hyperglycaemia by decreasing renal glucose threshold and thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion. The amount of glucose excreted in the urine depends on both the level of hyperglycaemia and the glomerular filtration rate. Results of numerous placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials of 12-104 weeks duration have shown significant reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), resulting in a significant increase in the proportion of patients reaching HbA1c targets, and a significant lowering of fasting plasma glucose when SGLT2 inhibitors were administered as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering therapies including insulin in patients with T2DM. In head-to-head trials of up to 2 years, SGLT2 inhibitors exerted similar glucose-lowering activity to metformin, sulphonylureas or sitagliptin. The durability of the glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be better; however, this remains to be more extensively investigated. The risk of hypoglycaemia was much lower with SGLT2 inhibitors than with sulphonylureas and was similarly low as that reported with metformin, pioglitazone or sitagliptin. Increased renal glucose elimination also assists weight loss and could help to reduce blood pressure. Both effects were very consistent across the trials and they represent some advantages for SGLT2 inhibitors when compared with other oral glucose-lowering agents. The pharmacodynamic response to SGLT2 inhibitors declines with increasing severity of renal impairment, and prescribing information for each SGLT2 inhibitor should be consulted regarding dosage adjustments or restrictions in moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Caution is also recommended in the elderly population because of a higher risk of renal impairment, orthostatic hypotension and dehydration, even if the absence of hypoglycaemia represents an obvious advantage in this population. The overall effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of cardiovascular disease is unknown and will be evaluated in several ongoing prospective placebo-controlled trials with cardiovascular outcomes. The impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function and their potential to influence the course of diabetic nephropathy also deserve more attention. SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events are female genital mycotic infections, while urinary tract infections are less commonly observed and generally benign. In conclusion, with their unique mechanism of action that is independent of insulin secretion and action, SGLT2 inhibitors are a useful addition to the therapeutic options available for the management of T2DM at any stage in the natural history of the disease. Although SGLT2 inhibitors have already been extensively investigated, further studies should even better delineate the best place of these new glucose-lowering agents in the already rich armamentarium for the management of T2DM."

Treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) continues to present challenges, with significant proportion of patients failing to achieve and maintain glycemic targets. Despite the availability of many oral antidiabetic agents, therapeutic efficacy is offset by side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutic agents with an improved benefit-risk profile continues. Recent research has focused on the kidney as a potential therapeutic target, especially because maximal renal glucose reabsorption is increased in T2DM. Under normal physiological conditions, nearly all filtered glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule of the nephron, principally via the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). SGLT2-inhibitors are a new class of oral antidiabetics, which reduce hyperglycemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion independently of insulin secretion or action. Clinical results are promising with significant lowering of HbA1c without increased risk of hypoglycemia, reduction of body weight and reduction of systolic blood pressure. Dapagliflozin is the first highly selective SGLT2-inhibitor approved by the European Medecine Agency. Canagliflozin and empagliflozin are undergoing phase III trials. Actual safety issues are an increased risk for genital- and urinary tract infections and a possible increased risk for bladder and breast cancer. This led to refusal of dapagliflozin by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A large randomized control trial is therefore warranted by the FDA. This review provides an overview of the current evidence available so far on the therapeutic potential of the SGLT2-inhibitors for the treatment of T2DM."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule occurs predominantly via the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). There has been intense interest in this transporter as a number of SGLT2 inhibitors have entered clinical development. SGLT2 inhibitors act to lower plasma glucose by promoting glycosuria and this review aims to outline the effect on the diabetic kidney of this hypoglycaemic agent. RECENT FINDINGS This review provides an overview of recent findings in this area: the transcriptional control of SGLT2 expression in human proximal tubular cells implicates a number of cytokines in the alteration of SGLT2 expression; experimental data show that SGLT2 inhibition may correct early detrimental effects of diabetes by reducing proximal tubular sodium and glucose transport, suggesting a possible renoprotective effect independent of the glucose lowering effects of these agents; and the nonglycaemic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors may have an impact on renal outcomes. SUMMARY The available clinical evidence shows consistent reduction in glycaemic parameters and some evidence suggests additional effects including weight loss and mild blood pressure reduction. There are some side effects that warrant further investigation and establishing whether SGLT2 inhibition provides a renal benefit relies on future long-term studies with specific renal end-points."

SGLT2 inhibitors were found to be effective in lowering HbA1c levels in double-blinded studies, both as monotherapy and in combination with other oral hypoglycemic medications of various other mechanisms of action. SGLT2 Inhibitors are not a risk factor for hypoglycemia and are suitable for combination with insulin therapy. Their unique mode of action, relying on glomerular filtration, make these medication unsuitable for usage as treatment for type 2 diabetes patients who are also suffering from moderate to severe renal failure.

Acute rejection episodes are now as low as 5-20% in the first year after renal transplantation; however, graft half-life has remained almost unchanged in the last decade. This statistic is mainly attributable to the side effects of immunosuppression, with loss of allografts due to the chronic allograft nephropathy that is a consequence of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity or hypertension. Patient death due to cardiovascular events, infections and malignancy also contribute to allograft loss. The introduction of the inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin sirolimus and everolimus in renal transplantation has increased the repertoire of immunosuppressive protocols substantially. They have a different mode of action and a different side effect profile (i.e. lower nephrotoxicity, less hypertension and less neoplastic potential) than the calcineurin inhibitors.

The mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR)and its molecular pathways are supposed to be activated frequently in human renal cell carcinoma as well as other cancers. It has a kinase activity for 40S ribosomal protein kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1. These proteins, when phosphorylated, promote protein translation and RNA transcription in the nutrient-rich condition. mTOR inhibitors such as Temsirolimus (CCI779) and Everolimus (RAD001) are effective for suppressing cell growth with inhibiting mTOR kinase activity. Rapamycin and its related analogs such as Temsirolimus and Everolimus are less toxic for humans compared with other anti-VEGFR inhibitors and has been used as an immunosuppressive agent. These agents have an inhibitory activity against the mTORC1 complex. Since they do not have inhibitory activity against mTORC2 complex, the ability of mTOR inhibition by Temsirolimus is supposed to be 40 to 50% of full inhibition in mTOR kinase. Temsirolimus has modest anticancer activity against advanced clinical RCC patients with poor risk. The objective response rate was only 7%, 26% of patients experienced minor responses and another 17% of patients had stable disease that lasted 6 months. The median time to tumor progression and median survival for the study patients were 5.8 and 15.0 months, respectively. The overall survival of patients treated with Temsirolimus alone was statistically longer than in those treated with IFN alone in the 626 cases in phase II study. Combinations of mTOR with other anti- VEGFR agents were not effective. Vertical therapies of mTOR inhibitor in combination with AKT inhibitors, or newly development of stronger mTOR kinase which can suppress both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are planned at present."

OBJECTIVES To investigate the benefits and harms of immunosuppressive regimens containing TOR-I when compared to other regimens as initial therapy for kidney transplant recipients. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in The Cochrane Library, issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966-June 2005), EMBASE (1980-June 2005), the specialised register of the Cochrane Renal Group (June 2005)., and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to identify relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs where drug regimens containing TOR-I were compared to alternative drug regimens in the immediate post-transplant period were included, without age restriction, dosage or language of report. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two reviewers independently assessed trials for eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Results are expressed as relative risk (RR) or weight mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS Thirty three trials (142 reports) were included (sirolimus (27), everolimus (5), head-to-head (1)). When TOR-I replaced CNI there was no difference in acute rejection, but serum creatinine was lower (MD -18.31 micromol/L, -30.96 to -5.67), and bone marrow more suppressed (leucopenia: RR 2.02 1.12 to 3.66; thrombocytopenia: RR 6.97 2.97 to 16.36; anaemia: RR 1.67, 1.27 to 2.20). When TOR-I replaced antimetabolites, acute rejection (RR 0.84, 0.71 to 0.99) and cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) (RR 0.49; 0.37 to 0.65) were reduced, but hypercholesterolaemia was increased (RR 1.65, 1.32 to 2.06). For low versus high-dose TOR-I, with equal CNI dose, rejection was increased (RR 1.23, 1.06 to 1.43) but calculated GFR higher (MD 4.27 mL/min, 1.12 to 7.41), and for low-dose TOR-I/standard-dose CNI versus higher-dose TOR-I/reduced CNI, acute rejection (RR 0.67, 0.52 to 0.88) and calculated GFR (MD -9.46 mL/min, -12.16 to -6.76) were reduced. There was no significant difference in mortality, graft loss or malignancy risk for TOR-I in any comparison. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS TOR-I have been evaluated in four different primary immunosuppressive algorithms; as replacement for CNI and for antimetabolites, in combination with CNI at low and high dose and with variable dose of CNI. Generally, surrogate endpoints for graft survival favour TOR-I (lower risk of acute rejection and higher GFR) and surrogate endpoints for patient outcomes are worsened by TOR-I (bone marrow suppression, lipid disturbance). Long-term hard-endpoint data from methodologically robust RCTs are still needed."

Sorafenib and sunitinib are inhibitors of receptor protein tyrosine kinases (TKIs) and are approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Although the mTOR inhibitor everolimus is effective for the treatment of patients who have failed TKI therapy, it is important to consider all available treatment options before switching therapy mode of action. Herein, we report outcomes in patients with mRCC switched to sorafenib following disease progression on sunitinib treatment. The medical records of 35 patients treated between November 2006 and November 2009 at two large referral centers in Greece were retrospectively analyzed for time-to-progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and tolerability of sorafenib after sunitinib. Median TTP and OS on sorafenib were 4.9 and 11.5 months, respectively. Among 33 patients evaluable for tumor response, three had a partial response and 17 achieved disease stabilization (objective response rate 8.5%; total clinical benefit rate 57%). Sorafenib was well tolerated, with mostly grade 1/2 adverse events and no treatment-related deaths. Sorafenib was effective and well tolerated in this group of patients. The TTP with sorafenib following sunitinib was comparable to outcomes reported previously, providing further support that TKIs should be used in sequence before switching to an mTOR inhibitor."

BACKGROUND/AIM The mode of action of the somatostatin analog octreotide on neuro-endocrine tumour proliferation is largely unknown. Overexpression of the proto-oncogene Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) has been demonstrated in certain neuro-endocrine tumours: Akt activates downstream proteins including mTOR and p70S6K, which play an important role in cell proliferation. RAD001 (everolimus) is a novel agent that is being trialled in the treatment of neuro-endocrine tumours, and is known to interact with mTOR. We explored the mechanism of action of octreotide, RAD001, and their combination on cell proliferation and kinase activation in a neuro-endocrine tumour cell line (rat insulinoma cell line, INS1). METHODS Proliferation assays were used to determine the effects of octreotide, RAD001, and their combination on cell proliferation. Western blotting was used to characterize the expression of phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated TSC2, phosphorylated mTOR, and phosphorylated 70S6K. RESULTS Treatment with octreotide and RAD001 inhibited proliferation and attenuated phosphorylation of all downstream targets of Akt: TSC2, mTOR, and p70S6K. CONCLUSIONS In this cell model, octreotide and RAD001 appear to act through a similar pathway and inhibit the Akt-mTOR-p70S6 kinase pathway downstream of Akt. There may be some overlapping effects of the two inhibitors on the mTOR pathway, although it is likely that other additional effects may differentiate the two agents."

PURPOSE More than 90% of Ewing's sarcomas (ES) contain a fusion of the EWS and FLI1 genes, due to the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation. At the molecular level, the EWS-FLI1 rearrangements show great diversity. Specifically, many different combinations of exons from EWS and FLI1 encode in-frame fusion transcripts and result in differences in the length and composition of the chimeric protein, which functions as an oncogenic aberrant transcription factor. In the most common fusion type (type 1), EWS exon 7 is linked in frame with exon 6 of FLI1. As the fundamental pathogenetic lesion in ES, the molecular heterogeneity of these fusion transcripts may have functional and clinical significance. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a clinical and pathologic analysis of 112 patients with ES in which EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts were identified by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Adequate treatment and follow-up data were available in 99 patients treated with curative intent. Median follow-up in these 99 patients was 26 months (range, 1 to 140 months). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed that included other prognostic factors, such as age, tumor location, size, and stage. RESULTS Among the 99 patients suitable for survival analysis, the tumors in 64 patients contained the type 1 fusion and in 35 patients contained less common fusion types. Stage at presentation was localized in 74 patients and metastatic in 25. Metastases (relative risk [RR] = 2.6; P = .008), and type 1 EWS-FLI1 fusion (RR = 0.37; P = .014) were, respectively, independent negative and positive prognostic factors for overall survival by multivariate analysis. Among 74 patients with localized tumors, the type 1 EWS-FLI1 fusion was also a significant positive predictor of overall survival (RR = 0.32; P = .034) by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION EWS-FLI1 fusion type appears to be prognostically relevant in ES, independent of tumor site, stage, and size. Further studies are needed to clarify the biologic basis of this phenomenon."

BACKGROUND Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ES/pPNET) is often difficult to distinguish from other small round cell tumors. The EWS-Ets gene fusions that result from chromosomal translocations in this tumor provide potential molecular diagnostic markers. To apply these molecular markers to commonly available archival materials, we evaluated the feasibility of detecting EWS-Ets including EWS-Fli1 and EWS-ERG fusion transcripts in paraffin-embedded tissues and its diagnostic value for detecting ES/pPNET. METHODS Thirteen paraffin-embedded samples of ES/pPNETs were retrieved from archives. Thirteen cases of other tumors with small round cell features (including rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, lymphoma, small cell carcinoma, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor) were used as negative controls. Beta-actin and beta2-microglobulin were used as internal controls. A nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assay was performed to detect the EWS-Fli1 and EWS-ERG fusion transcripts. RESULTS Beta-actin and beta2-microglobulin were detected in 10/13 and 13/13 ES/pPNETs, respectively. EWS-Fli1 fusion transcripts were detected in 11 of 13 (85%) ES/pPNETs. Three chimeric transcripts, all EWS-Fli1, were detected in ES/pPNET samples. Among 11 EWS-Fli1-positive cases, 7 cases had a type I fusion transcript involving fusion of EWS exon 7 with Fli1 exon 6, 2 cases had a type II fusion transcript involving EWS exon 7 with Fli1 exon 5, and 2 cases expressed fusion transcripts involving EWS exon 7 and Fli1 exon 8. Type I EWS-Fli1 fusion predominated over other types. Fusion types could not be distinguished in the remaining 2 cases. Thirteen negative controls did not show detectable chimeric messages. There was a significant relationship between EWS-Fli1 fusion transcripts and CD99 expression. CONCLUSIONS Molecular detection of EWS-Fli1 fusion transcripts in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material by nested RT-PCR is feasible and is useful for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of ES/pPNETs."

The aims of this study were (1) to present the diverse clinicopathological and molecular profile of EFTs in our settings, (2) to identify a pragmatic approach for diagnosing EFTs, especially for application of ancillary techniques, namely RT-PCR for specific transcripts (EWS-FLI1, EWS-ERG) and FISH for EWSR1 gene rearrangement, in certain cases and (3) to show the utility of tissue microarray in establishing a new FISH test. Fifty-eight EFTs were identified in 38 males and 20 females within an age-range of 1-65 years (median, 16), mostly in lower extremities (14) (24.1 %). Therapeutically, most patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with subsequent surgery. Histopathologically, diagnosis of EFTs was initially offered in 41/58 (70.6 %) tumors. On review, 59 % tumors showed diffuse pattern, while 41 % displayed rosettes. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were mostly diffusely positive for CD99 (48/52) (92.3 %); FLI-1 (17/18) (94.4 %); variably for BCL2 (16/18) (88.8 %), synaptophysin (6/20) (35 %), S100-P (2/7) (28.5 %), CD56 (2/5) (40 %), NSE (2/5) (40 %), calponin (3/4) (75 %), EMA (5/24) (20.8 %) and CK (3/24) (12.5 %), the latter two mostly focally. Fifty five tumors were EWS-FLI1 positive, while a single tumor was EWS-ERG positive. Sensitivity for PCR was 61 %. EWSR1 rearrangement was detected by FISH in 12/13 Ewing sarcomas/PNETs. Sensitivity for EWSR1 test was 92.3 % and specificity was 100 %. Thirty-eight tumors, including 14 molecular confirmed EFTs and 21 other tumors were tested for EWSR1 rearrangement. Among 21 unrelated tumors, EWSR1 rearrangement was detected in few myoepithelial tumors, occasional desmoplastic small round cell tumor and an extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma. Further, a tissue microarray with a separate set of 8 EFTs, confirmed at another laboratory was analysed for validation of EWSR1 rearrangement test. 23/28 (82.1 %) tissue cores of the tissue microarray, stained by FISH were interpretable, including EWSR1 rearrangement, detected in 20/28 tissue cores; not detected in 3 liver cores and uninterpretable in 5 (17.8 %) cores. Classical EFTs can be diagnosed with diffuse, membranous CD99 positivity, intranuclear FLI1 positivity and LCA negativity in malignant round cells. In unconventional cases, it is indispensable to reveal the concomitant fusion m-RNA by RT-PCR. In case of negative molecular results, it is necessary to prove EWSR1 rearrangement by FISH. These tests should be interpreted with clinicopathological correlation. Tissue microarrays for FISH are useful during validation of a new test, especially when sarcomas like EFTs show less genetic heterogeneity within tumor cells."

BACKGROUND Chromosomal translocations t(11;22) (q24;q12) are characteristic of about 80-90 % of Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors [bone and soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumors (PNET)]. They generate ews/fli1 rearrangements showing great diversity in breakpoint exon combination. In about 5 % of Ewing's tumors, ews is fused to the erg gene at 21q22. The various chimeric proteins encoded may function as aberrant oncogenic transcription factors. These specific translocations can be used for exact molecular diagnosis in these poorly differentiated small round-cell tumors. Moreover, the prognostic relevance of different translocational variants has been previously suggested. Furthermore, the sensitive molecular detection of minimal metastatic and residual disease and its clinical significance can be evaluated. To address these questions more definitively in the large number of patients registered in multicenter studies, it is often necessary to access archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissue if no fresh or frozen tumor material is available for analysis by RT (reverse transcription)-PCR. Specific problems arise from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue due to the degradation of RNA and insufficient extraction efficiency. Therefore, primer distance and product size are limited for successful PCR amplification. This conflicts with the requirement for identification of various possible exon combinations by PCR simultaneously using one single primer pair with larger distance. PATIENTS We examined paraffin embedded soft part tumor tissue samples from 47 Ewing's tumor patients. Patients were treated according to either CWS (Cooperative Weichteilsarkomstudie, CWS-91 or CWS-96) or Euro-E.W.I.N.G. 99 therapy protocols. METHOD We established a novel RT-PCR method, using 3 different exon specific sets of PCR primer pairs, selected according to the coding ews and fli1 nucleotide sequences (NCBI database), suitable for RT-PCR identification of variant ews/fli1 fusion transcripts in RNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. For use in combination with ews -primer, an erg specific primer was selected to alternatively test for ews/erg fusion transcripts. As positive control for the integrity of isolated mRNA, we used the ubiquitously expressed gapdh transcript for RT-PCR amplification in each sample. RESULTS In 31 cases (= 66 %) of 47 paraffin samples of Ewing's tumors analysed, gapdh control indicated adequate quality of RNA. In 16 cases no gapdh control fragment was amplifiable, nevertheless in 2 of these 16 samples distinct ews fusion products could be detected. In 23 cases we identified ews fusion transcripts. Thereof in 65 % ews exon 7 being fused to fli1 exon 6 (fusion type I), in 22 % to fli1 exon 5 (fusion type II). In 4 % each ews exon 10 being juxtaposed to fli1 either exon 6 or exon 5, respectively. An ews/erg fusion was detected in 4 % ( ews exon 7 fused to erg exon 6). In 10 samples, a gapdh fragment was amplified, but no ews/fli1 or - erg fusion transcript could be identified. The reference pathological review (I. L., Kiel, Germany) disproved the primary histopathology in 5 cases. CONCLUSIONS Using our different sets of exon specific primer pairs, it was possible to detect 4 different breakpoints of ews/fli1 fusion transcripts and the ews/erg fusion by RT-PCR in RNA isolates from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded Ewing's tumor tissue. This method can be a very useful alternative in clinical situations (to ensure diagnosis and perform minimal metastatic and residual disease investigations) and in order to assess prognostic significance of translocation subtypes when no fresh tumor tissue is available."

However, its potential has rarely been applied in embryos of animal model organisms and was only performed under transient protein expression levels. RESULTS Using a Hox protein partnership as a test case, we investigated the suitability of BiFC for the study of protein interactions in the living Drosophila embryo. Importantly, all BiFC parameters were established with constructs that were stably expressed under the control of endogenous promoters. Under these physiological conditions, we showed that BiFC is specific and sensitive enough to analyse dynamic protein interactions. We next used BiFC in a candidate interaction screen, which led to the identification of several Hox protein partners. CONCLUSION Our results establish the general suitability of BiFC for revealing and studying protein interactions in their physiological context during the rapid course of Drosophila embryonic development."

Investigations of the molecular processes that sustain life must include studies of these processes in their normal cellular environment. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay provides an approach for the visualization of protein interactions and modifications in living cells. This assay is based on the facilitated association of complementary fragments of a fluorescent protein that are fused to interaction partners. Complex formation by the interaction partners tethers the fluorescent protein fragments in proximity to each other, which can facilitate their association. The BiFC assay enables sensitive visualization of protein complexes with high spatial resolution. The temporal resolution of BiFC analysis is limited by the time required for fluorophore formation, as well as the stabilization of complexes by association of the fluorescent protein fragments. Many modifications and enhancements to the BiFC assay have been developed. The multicolor BiFC assay enables simultaneous visualization of multiple protein complexes in the same cell, and can be used to investigate competition among mutually exclusive interaction partners for complex formation in cells. The ubiquitin-mediated fluorescence complementation (UbFC) assay enables visualization of covalent ubiquitin family peptide conjugation to substrate proteins in cells. The BiFC assay can also be used to visualize protein binding to specific chromatin domains, as well as other molecular scaffolds in cells. BiFC analysis therefore provides a powerful approach for the visualization of a variety of processes that affect molecular proximity in living cells. The visualization of macromolecular interactions and modifications is of great importance owing to the central roles of proteins, nucleic acids and other macromolecular complexes in the regulation of cellular functions. This tutorial review describes the BiFC assay, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of this experimental approach. The review will be of interest to scientists interested in the investigation of macromolecular interactions or modifications who need exquisite sensitivity for the detection of their complexes or conjugates of interest."

BiFC must be confirmed by parallel analysis of proteins in which the interaction interface has been mutated. It is not necessary for the interaction partners to juxtapose the fragments within a specific distance of each other because they can associate when they are tethered to a complex with flexible linkers. It is also not necessary for the interaction partners to form a complex with a long half-life or a high occupancy since the fragments can associate in a transient complex and un-associated fusion proteins do not interfere with detection of the complex.

BACKGROUND Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a clinically heterogeneous genetic heart disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of another disease that could explain the wall thickening. Elucidation of the genetic basis of HCM lead to the identification of several genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, such as MYH7, MYBPC3, TPM1, TNNT2, and TNNI3. Sarcomeric genes are mutated in approximately 40% of HCM patients and a possible explanation for the incomplete yield of mutation-positive HCM may be somatic mutations. METHODS AND RESULTS We studied 104 unrelated patients with non-familial HCM. Patients underwent clinical evaluation and mutation screening of 5 genes implicated in HCM (MYH7, MYBPC3, TPM1, TNNT2, and TNNI3) in genomic DNA isolated from resected cardiac tissue; 41 of 104 were found to carry a mutation, but as several patients carried the same mutations, the total amount of different mutations was 37; 20 of these mutations have been previously described, and pathogenicity has been assessed. To determine the effect of the 17 new mutations an in silico assay was performed and it predicted that 4 variants were damaging mutations. All identified variants were also seen in the DNA isolated from the corresponding blood, which demonstrated the absence of somatic mutations.

Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), due to point mutations in genes for sarcomere proteins such as myosin, occurs in 1/500 people and is the most common cause of sudden death in young individuals. Similar mutations in skeletal muscle, e.g., in the MYH7 gene for slow myosin found in both the cardiac ventricle and slow skeletal muscle, may also cause severe disease but the severity and the morphological changes are often different. In HCM, the modified protein function leads, over years to decades, to secondary remodeling with substantial morphological changes, such as hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and extensive fibrosis associated with severe functional deterioration. Despite intense studies, it is unclear how the moderate mutation-induced changes in protein function cause the long-term effects. In hypertrophy of the heart due to pressure overload (e.g., hypertension), mechanical stress in the myocyte is believed to be major initiating stimulus for activation of relevant cell signaling cascades. Here it is considered how expression of mutated proteins, such as myosin or regulatory proteins, could have similar consequences through one or both of the following mechanisms: (1) contractile instabilities within each sarcomere (with more than one stable velocity for a given load), (2) different tension generating capacities of cells in series. These mechanisms would have the potential to cause increased tension and/or stretch of certain cells during parts of the cardiac cycle. Modeling studies are used to illustrate these ideas and experimental tests are proposed. The applicability of similar ideas to skeletal muscle is also postulated, and differences between heart and skeletal muscle are discussed."

METHODS AND RESULTS To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the abnormal CM functions in HCM, we derived iPSCs from an HCM patient with a single missense mutation (Arginine442Glycine) in the MYH7 gene.

A widespread increase of genes responsible for 'Cell Proliferation' was observed in HCM iPSC-CMs when compared with control iPSC-CMs. Additionally, HCM iPSC-CMs exhibited disorganized sarcomeres and electrophysiological irregularities. Furthermore, disease phenotypes of HCM iPSC-CMs were attenuated with pharmaceutical treatments. CONCLUSION Overall, this study explored the possible patient-specific and mutation-specific disease mechanism of HCM, and demonstrates the potential of using HCM iPSC-CMs for future development of therapeutic strategies.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disease of the cardiac muscle that occurs mainly due to mutations (>1,400 variants) in genes encoding for the cardiac sarcomere. HCM, the most common familial form of cardiomyopathy, affecting one in every 500 people in the general population, is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and presents variable expressivity and age-related penetrance. Due to the morphological and pathological heterogeneity of the disease, the appearance and progression of symptoms is not straightforward. Most HCM patients are asymptomatic, but up to 25% develop significant symptoms, including chest pain and sudden cardiac death. Sudden cardiac death is a dramatic event, since it occurs without warning and mainly in younger people, including trained athletes. Molecular diagnosis of HCM is of the outmost importance, since it may allow detection of subjects carrying mutations on HCM-associated genes before development of clinical symptoms of HCM. However, due to the genetic heterogeneity of HCM, molecular diagnosis is difficult. Currently, there are mainly four techniques used for molecular diagnosis of HCM, including Sanger sequencing, high resolution melting, mutation detection using DNA arrays, and next-generation sequencing techniques. Application of these methods has proven successful for identification of mutations on HCM-related genes. This review summarizes the features of these technologies, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, current therapeutics for HCM patients are correlated with clinically observed phenotypes and are based on the alleviation of symptoms. This is mainly due to insufficient knowledge on the mechanisms involved in the onset of HCM. Tissue engineering alongside regenerative medicine coupled with nanotherapeutics may allow fulfillment of those gaps, together with screening of novel therapeutic drugs and target delivery systems."

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant inherited genetic disease characterized by compensatory pathological left ventricle (LV) hypertrophy due to sarcomere dysfunction. In an important proportion of patients with HCM, the site and extent of cardiac hypertrophy results in severe obstruction to LV outflow tract (LVOT), contributing to disabling symptoms and increasing the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). In patients with progressive and/or refractory symptoms despite optimal pharmacological treatment, invasive therapies that diminish or abolish LVOT obstruction relieve heart failure-related symptoms, improve quality of life and could be associated with long-term survival similar to that observed in the general population. The gold standard in this respect is surgical septal myectomy, which might be supplementary associated with a reduction in SCD. Percutaneous techniques, particularly alcohol septal ablation (ASA) and more recently radiofrequency (RF) septal ablation, can achieve LVOT gradient reduction and symptomatic benefit in a large proportion of HOCM patients at the cost of a supposedly limited septal myocardial necrosis and a 10-20% risk of chronic atrioventricular block. After an initial period of enthusiasm, standard DDD pacing failed to show in randomized trials significant LVOT gradient reductions and objective improvement in exercise capacity. However, case reports and recent small pilot studies suggested that atrial synchronous LV or biventricular (biV) pacing significantly reduce LVOT obstruction and improve symptoms (acutely as well as long-term) in a large proportion of severely symptomatic HOCM patients not suitable to other gradient reduction therapies. Moreover, biV/LV pacing in HOCM seems to be associated with significant LV reverse remodelling."

BACKGROUND Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) results from the clonal expansion of mature B lymphocytes and is characterized by extreme clinical heterogeneity.

RESULTS We found that 55.3% of cases belonged to M-CLL and 44.7% belonged to U-CLL, with progressive disease predominating in the unmutated subset. Most frequently expressed was the IGHV3 subgroup (55.7%), followed by IGHV1 (27.3%), IGHV4 (12.5%), IGHV5 (2.3%), IGHV2 (1.1%), and IGHV6 (1.1%). The distribution of IGHD subgroups was as follows: IGHD3, 39.1%; IGHD2, 21.8%; IGHD6, 12.6%; IGHD1, 10.3%; IGHD4, 8%; IGHD5, 6.9%; and IGHD7, 1.1%. The most frequent IGHJ gene was IGHJ4 (48.9%), followed by IGHJ6 (28.4%), IGHJ3 (11.4%), and IGHJ5 (11.4%). In 15.3% of cases, heavy complementarity-determining region 3 (VH CDR3) amino acid sequences could be assigned to previously defined stereotyped clusters. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed a strong correlation between IGHV gene mutational status and clinical course of CLL. IGHV gene use was comparable to that obtained for Mediterranean countries, with the exception of the IGHV4 subgroup, which was underrepresented in our cohort."

Cells were separated into cytosol and membrane protein fractions then labeled with acid-cleavable ICAT reagents (cICAT). Labeled proteins were digested with trypsin then subjected to SCX and affinity chromatography followed by LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer. A total of 9 proteins from the cytosol fraction and 4 from the membrane fraction showed a 3-fold or greater difference between M-CLL and UM-CLL and a subset of these were examined by Western blot where results concurred with cICAT abundance ratios. The abundance of one of the proteins in particular, the mitochondrial membrane protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit COX G was examined in 6 M-CLL and 6 UM-CLL patients using western blot and results showed significantly greater levels (P < 0.001) in M-CLL patients vs UM-CLL patients.

BACKGROUND Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is typically regarded as an indolent B-cell malignancy. However, there is wide variability with regards to need for therapy, time to progressive disease, and treatment response. This clinical variability is due, in part, to biological heterogeneity between individual patients' leukemias. While much has been learned about this biological variation using genomic approaches, it is unclear whether such efforts have sufficiently evaluated biological and clinical heterogeneity in CLL. METHODS To study the extent of genomic variability in CLL and the biological and clinical attributes of genomic classification in CLL, we evaluated 893 unique CLL samples from fifteen publicly available gene expression profiling datasets. We used unsupervised approaches to divide the data into subgroups, evaluated the biological pathways and genetic aberrations that were associated with the subgroups, and compared prognostic and clinical outcome data between the subgroups. RESULTS Using an unsupervised approach, we determined that approximately 600 CLL samples are needed to define the spectrum of diversity in CLL genomic expression. We identified seven genomically-defined CLL subgroups that have distinct biological properties, are associated with specific chromosomal deletions and amplifications, and have marked differences in molecular prognostic markers and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that investigations focusing on small numbers of patient samples likely provide a biased outlook on CLL biology. These findings may have important implications in identifying patients who should be treated with specific targeted therapies, which could have efficacy against CLL cells that rely on specific biological pathways."

Recently developed molecular prognostic tests in patients with early Binet stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) are costly and often require a high level of technologic expertise. Recent data give evidence for the prognostic relevance of the percentage of smudge cells in B-CLL. In our study we analysed the prognostic potential of this novel marker in a cohort of 100 CLL patients. The percentage of smudge cells ranged from 0% to 70% (median 21%). Patients with <or=20% smudge cells (according to ROC analysis) had a significantly shorter time to first treatment and overall survival than patients with >20% smudge cells. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified percentages of smudge cells, stage according to Binet and CD38 expression as independent prognostic markers. The percentage of smudge cells was significantly lower in CD38+, ZAP-70+ and unmutated IgVH patients. Combined analysis of smudge cell percentages with CD38 expression provided complementary prognostic information identifying three patient subgroups with good, intermediate and poor prognosis. Comparing gene expression profiles in a subset of 12 patients we identified eight differentially expressed genes in groups with high vs. low percentage of smudge cells suggesting a role of these differentially expressed genes, especially for Tribbles homolog 2 (Trib2), in the disease progression of high risk CLL patients. In conclusion, our data confirm previous studies showing that the simple and inexpensive microscopic detection of smudge cells on blood smears prepared for routine diagnostic purposes is a novel independent factor predicting overall survival in CLL."

Mutations in the ATM gene have been previously found in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLLs) but their clinical significance is unknown. We analyzed 155 CLL tumors and found 12% with ATM mutations and 4% with TP53 mutations; 2 tumors contained mutations in both genes. Retrospective analysis on selected samples indicated that the ATM mutations were usually present at diagnosis. Compared with patients with wild-type ATM/TP53 genes, patients with ATM mutations had statistically significantly reduced overall and treatment-free survival. Although present in both IGVH mutation subgroups, ATM mutations were associated with unmutated IGVH genes and they provided independent prognostic information on multivariate analysis. Mutations in the ATM gene resulted in impaired in vitro DNA damage responses. Tumors with ATM mutations only partially correlated with tumors with loss of an ATM allele through an 11q deletion and, interestingly, those 11q-deleted tumors with a second wild-type ATM allele had a preserved DNA damage response. The majority of patients with ATM mutations were refractory to DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs and as such might benefit from therapies that bypass the ATM/p53 pathway."

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease exhibiting variable clinical course and survival rates.

Instead, alternative markers of IGHV status, such as zeta-associated protein (ZAP70) or messenger RNA levels are often used. We report a (1)H-NMR-based metabolomics approach to examine serum metabolic profiles of early stage, untreated CLL patients (Binet stage A) classified on the basis of IGHV mutational status or ZAP70. Metabolic profiles of CLL patients (n=29) exhibited higher concentrations of pyruvate and glutamate and decreased concentrations of isoleucine compared with controls (n=9). Differences in metabolic profiles between unmutated (UM-IGHV; n=10) and mutated IGHV (M-IGHV; n=19) patients were determined using partial least square discriminatory analysis (PLS-DA; R(2)=0.74, Q(2)=0.36). The UM-IGHV patients had elevated levels of cholesterol, lactate, uridine and fumarate, and decreased levels of pyridoxine, glycerol, 3-hydroxybutyrate and methionine concentrations. The PLS-DA models derived from ZAP70 classifications showed comparatively poor goodness-of-fit values, suggesting that IGHV mutational status correlates better with disease-related metabolic profiles.

In this study, to understand the molecular basis of chromosomal abnormalities leading to tumor progression, 90 CLL patients were grouped into poor prognosis (with 11q deletion and trisomy 12) and good prognosis (with normal karyotype and 13q deletion) and their clinical outcome was assessed. Gene expression profiles of 35 CLL samples with poor outcome (11q deletion, n=9; trisomy 12, n=5) and good outcome (13q deletion, n=13; normal karyotype, n=8) were analyzed using oligonucleotide microarray. Significance analysis of microarray (SAM) identified 27 differentially expressed genes between these two subgroups with significant overexpression of ATF5 and underexpression of CDC16, PCDH8, SLAM, MNDA and ATF2 in CLL patients with poor outcome. ATF5 gene expression in CLL was further studied because of its role in the regulation of cell cycle progression/differentiation and apoptosis. The overexpression of ATF5 was confirmed by real-time PCR using 39 CLL samples from the poor and good outcome groups. ATF5 was significantly (p<0.001) overexpressed in the poor outcome group. Furthermore, ATF5 expression was significantly higher in the 11q deletion as well as trisomy 12 group alone compared to the 13q deletion and normal karyotype groups. ATF5 overexpression was also associated with significantly (p=0.04) shorter time to treatment. Similarly, expression of five underexpressed genes also correlated with longer time to treatment. Thus, this report demonstrates that ATF5 may be one of the key genes involved in increased proliferation and survival in 11q deletion or trisomy 12, whereas CD16, CD86, SLAM, MNDA and ATF2 may be involved in the decreased proliferation of CLL cells with 13q deletion or normal karyotype."

We also aimed to investigate whether the peripheral circadian machinery may be deregulated in CLL cells. The expression of CRY1, PER1, and PER2 was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 116 CLL patients. The expression at sequential time points over a 24-h period was measured in six CLL patients and six normal donors. We confirmed the differential expression of CRY1 in ZAP-70(+)/CD38(+) and ZAP-70(-)/CD38(-) CLL samples. Subgroups formed according to CRY1 expression levels differed significantly in time to treatment. This difference was even more pronounced for subgroups stratified by a CRY1 : PER2 expression ratio and the ratio was an independent prognostic marker in a multivariate model. Furthermore, our data indicate disturbances in the periodic expression of circadian genes in CLL cells. Because of their role in the expression of cell cycle-related and DNA-damage response genes, we suggest that the deregulated expression of circadian genes may be linked to the molecular pathogenesis of CLL."

Nucleosome remodelling complexes play a key role in gene activation in response to environmental changes by driving promoter chromatin to reach an accessible configuration. They also mediate genome-wide chromatin organization, although their role in processes other than activation-related chromatin remodelling are poorly understood. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADH2 gene represents an excellent model for understanding the role of chromatin structure and remodelling in gene regulation. Following glucose depletion, highly positioned promoter nucleosomes are destabilized leading to strictly regulated kinetics of transcriptional activation. Nevertheless, no chromatin remodelling activities responsible for establishing or remodelling ADH2 chromatin structure have been identified to date. Here we show that the absence of the Isw1 and Chd1 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling activities delays the maximal expression of ADH2 without impairing the chromatin remodelling that occurs upon activation. Instead, a destabilized chromatin structure on the ADH2 coding and termination region is observed in the absence of Isw1 or Chd1 in repressing conditions. The specific Isw1 complex involved in this nucleosome repositioning is Isw1b because the deletion of Ioc2 and Ioc4, but not of Ioc3, causes the same phenotype as the deletion of Isw1. Moreover, the lack of Chd1 combined with the absence of Isw1 and Isw2 impairs nucleosome spacing along the ADH2 gene, and genome-wide in S. cerevisiae. Thus, the ISWI and Chd1 remodelling factors are not only involved in transcription-related chromatin remodelling, but also are required to maintain a specific chromatin configuration across the yeast genome."

Chromodomain from heterochromatin protein 1 and polycomb protein is known to be a lysine-methylated histone H3 tail-binding module. Chromo-helicase/ATPase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor, containing two tandem chromodomains. In human CHD1, both chromodomains are essential for specific binding to a K4 methylated histone H3 (H3 MeK4) peptide and are found to bind cooperatively in the crystal structure. For the budding yeast homologue, Chd1, the second but not the first chromodomain was once reported to bind to an H3 MeK4 peptide. Here, we reveal that neither the second chromodomain nor a region containing tandem chromodomains from yeast Chd1 bind to any lysine-methylated or arginine-methylated histone peptides that we examined. In addition, we examined the structures of the chromodomains from Chd1 by NMR. Although the tertiary structure of the region containing tandem chromodomains could not be obtained, the secondary structure deduced from NMR is well conserved in the tertiary structures of the corresponding first and second chromodomains determined individually by NMR. Both chromodomains of Chd1 demonstrate a structure similar to that of the corresponding part of CHD1, consisting of a three-stranded beta-sheet followed by a C-terminal alpha-helix. However, an additional helix between the first and second beta-strands, which is found in both of the first chromodomains of Chd1 and CHD1, is positioned in an entirely different manner in Chd1 and CHD1. In human CHD1 this helix forms the peptide-binding site. The amino acid sequences of the chromodomains could be well aligned on the basis of these structures. The alignment showed that yeast Chd1 lacks several key functional residues, which are responsible for specific binding to a methylated lysine residue in other chromodomains.

To investigate the action of CHD1 on higher order chromatin structure in differentiated cells, we examined the consequences of loss of CHD1 and over-expression of CHD1 on polytene chromosomes from salivary glands of third instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae. We observed that chromosome structure is sensitive to the amount of this remodeler. Loss of CHD1 resulted in alterations of chromosome structure and an increase in the heterochromatin protein HP1a, while over-expression of CHD1 disrupted higher order chromatin structure and caused a decrease in levels of HP1a. Over-expression of an ATPase inactive form of CHD1 did not result in severe chromosomal defects, suggesting that the ATPase activity is required for this in vivo phenotype. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II.

For example, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) have been shown to participate in many essential cellular processes, particularly those associated with activation of transcription. Yeast SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) and SLIK (SAGA-like) are two highly homologous and conserved multi-subunit HAT complexes, which preferentially acetylate histones H3 and H2B and deubiquitinate histone H2B.

Our findings indicate that one of the two chromodomains of Chd1 specifically interacts with the methylated lysine 4 mark on histone H3 that is associated with transcriptional activity.

ISWI proteins form the catalytic core of a subset of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities in eukaryotes from yeast to man. Many of these complexes have been found to reposition nucleosomes but with different directionalities. We find that the yeast Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes preferentially move nucleosomes toward more central locations on short DNA fragments whereas Isw1b does not. Importantly, the inherent positioning properties of the DNA play an important role in determining where nucleosomes are relocated to by all of these enzymes. However, a key difference is that the Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes are unable to move nucleosomes to positions closer than 15 bp from a DNA end, whereas Isw1b can. We also find that there is a correlation between the inability of enzymes to move nucleosomes close to DNA ends and the preferential binding to nucleosomes bearing linker DNA. These observations suggest that the accessibility of linker DNA together with the positioning properties of the underlying DNA play important roles in determining the outcome of remodeling by these enzymes."

Spt4-Spt5, a general transcription elongation factor for RNA polymerase II, also has roles in chromatin regulation. However, the relationships between these functions are not clear. Previously, we isolated suppressors of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae spt5 mutation in genes encoding members of the Paf1 complex, which regulates several cotranscriptional histone modifications, and Chd1, a chromatin remodeling enzyme. Here, we show that this suppression of spt5 can result from loss of histone H3 lysines 4 or 36 methylation, or reduced recruitment of Chd1 or the Rpd3S complex. These spt5 suppressors also rescue the synthetic growth defects observed in spt5 mutants that also lack elongation factor TFIIS. Using a FLO8 reporter gene, we found that a chd1 mutation caused cryptic initiation of transcription. We further observed enhancement of cryptic initiation in chd1 isw1 mutants and increased histone acetylation in a chd1 mutant. We suggest that, as previously proposed for H3 lysine 36 methylation and the Rpd3S complex, H3 lysine 4 methylation and Chd1 function to maintain normal chromatin structures over transcribed genes, and that one function of Spt4-Spt5 is to help RNA polymerase II overcome the repressive effects of these histone modifications and chromatin regulators on transcription."

We previously demonstrated that the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) MKP7 and M3/6 bind the scaffold JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) and inactivate the bound subset of JNK (1). The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) adaptor beta-arrestin 2 is also a JNK3 scaffold. It binds the upstream kinases ASK1 and MKK4 and couples stimulation of the angiotensin II receptor AT1aR to activation of a cytoplasmic pool of JNK3. Here we report that MKP7 also binds beta-arrestin 2 via amino acids 394-443 of MKP7, the same region that interacts with JIP-1. This region of MKP7 interacts with beta-arrestin 2 at a central region near the JNK binding domain. MKP7 dephosphorylates JNK3 bound to beta-arrestin 2, either following activation by ASK1 overexpression or following AT1aR stimulation. Initial AT1aR stimulation causes a rapid (within 5 min) dissociation of MKP7 from beta-arrestin 2. MKP7 then reassociates with beta-arrestin 2 on endocytic vesicles 30-60 min after initial receptor stimulation. This dynamic interaction between phosphatase and scaffold permits signal transduction through a module that binds both positive and negative regulators."

Numerous JNK phosphatases including dual-specificity phosphatases [4, 5], have been identified. Many stimuli activate JNK by increasing its rate of phosphorylation; however, JNK dephosphorylation is inhibited in cells after heat shock [6], suggesting that a JNK phosphatase(s) is inactivated. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8]. We have previously expressed M3/6 in the mouse bone marrow cell line BAF3 in order to show that JNK activation by IL-3 is necessary for cell survival and proliferation [9]. Here we report that M3/6 dissociates from JNK and appears in an insoluble fraction after heat shock.

This study examines the molecular mechanism underlying JNK dephosphorylation and inactivation evoked by dual-specificity phosphates following cerebral ischemia. The results revealed upregulation of dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) activity at 4 h of reperfusion in rat hippocampi. This was accompanied by the dephosphorylation of JNK. The M3/6 inhibitor, anisomycin, was found to enhance JNK activity following postischemic reperfusion, suggesting that M3/6 is closely associated with JNK inactivation following cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia also induced an increase in heat shock protein (HSP70) levels, which is involved in the upregulation of soluble cytoplasmic M3/6 levels. The inhibition of HSP70 using quercetin resulted in an elevation of JNK activity by decreasing the cytoplasmic solubility of M3/6.

Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress. M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK. It has been shown that M3/6 itself is phosphorylated by JNK upon stimulation with arsenite, but the role of this phosphorylation has not been investigated. In this study, we mapped JNK-induced phosphorylation sites on M3/6 using mass spectrometry. Phosphorylated residues Ser 515, Thr 518 and Ser 520 were identified and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to investigate their role. Upon arsenite stimulation, M3/6 mutated at these sites exhibited decreased phosphorylation compared to the wild-type protein. No difference was observed in terms of the enzyme's in vitro phosphatase activity, its substrate specificity towards JNK isoforms, its interactions with JNK and the scaffold family of JNK-interacting proteins (JIPs), its stability or its subcellular localization. Interestingly, expression of M3/6 phosphorylation mutants delayed the time-course of JNK phosphorylation and activation by arsenite. We propose that phosphorylation of the M3/6 phosphatase by JNK in response to stress stimuli results in attenuation of phosphatase activity and acceleration of JNK activation."

Here we describe two new dual specificity phosphatases of the CL100/MKP-1 family that are selective for inactivating ERK or JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases when expressed in COS-7 cells. M3/6 is the first phosphatase of this family to display highly specific inactivation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases. Although stress-induced activation of p54 SAPKbeta, p46 SAPKgamma (JNK1) or p38 MAP kinases is abolished upon co-transfection with increasing amounts of M3/6 plasmid, epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK1 is remarkably insensitive even to the highest levels of M3/6 expression obtained. In contrast to M3/6, the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-3 is selective for inactivation of ERK family MAP kinases. Low level expression of MKP-3 blocks totally epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK1, whereas stress-induced activation of p54 SAPKbeta and p38 MAP kinases is inhibited only partially under identical conditions. Selective regulation by M3/6 and MKP-3 was also observed upon chronic MAP kinase activation by constitutive p21(ras) GTPases. Hence, although M3/6 expression effectively blocked p54 SAPKbeta activation by p21(rac) (G12V), ERK1 activated by p21(ras) (G12V) was insensitive to this phosphatase. ERK1 activation by oncogenic p21(ras) was, however, blocked totally by co-expression of MKP-3.

Polyglutamine expansion-induced stress shared common features with protein-damaging stress such as heat shock, because activation of JNK involved inhibition of JNK phosphatase activities. Indeed, expanded polyglutamine impaired the solubility of the dual-specificity JNK phosphatase M3/6. Aggregation of M3/6 by polyglutamine expansion appeared to be indirect, because M3/6 was not recruited into polyglutamine inclusions. The heat shock protein HSP70, which is known to inhibit JNK during the heat shock response, suppressed polyglutamine-mediated aggregation of M3/6 and activation of JNK. Interestingly, levels of HSP70 were down-regulated by polyglutamine expansion.

To investigate whether the rapid deactivation of SAPK results from dephosphorylation by dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs), we studied regulation of the DSP hVH5 and its murine orthologue M3/6 in K562 human leukemia cells. PMA treatment rapidly induced hVH5 transcripts in these cells, and induced expression of M3/6 completely inhibited PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of SAPK, suggesting a feedback loop to control SAPK activity. Using both stable cell lines and transient transfection we demonstrate that activation of SAPK rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of M3/6. This phosphorylation did not regulate the half-life of total cellular M3/6. hVH5 and M3/6 shares with all sequenced mammalian DSPs an amino acid motif, XILPXLXL, located approximately 80 amino acids from the active site. The hVH5-M3/6 sequence, RILPHLYL, shares significant homology with the SAPK binding site of the c-Jun protein, called the delta domain. This motif was found to be important for DSP function, because deletion of RILPHLYL inhibits SAPK-mediated phosphorylation of M3/6, and deletion of this sequence or mutation of the LYL portion blocks the ability of this phosphatase to dephosphorylate SAPK."

Phosphatases play a particularly important role in this respect, by tightly controlling MAPK phosphorylation and activation.

We have investigated the interaction of M3/6 with JNK isoforms, as well as scaffold proteins of the JNK interacting protein (JIP) family, in order to elucidate the contribution of M3/6 to the regulation of distinct JNK signaling modules. M3/6 exhibited stronger binding towards JNK1\u03b2 and JNK2\u03b1 isoforms and this was reflected in higher enzymatic activity towards JNK2\u03b12 when compared to JNK1\u03b11 in vitro. After activation of the pathway by exposure of cells to arsenite, the interaction of M3/6 with JNK1\u03b1 and JNK3 was enhanced, whereas that with JNK1\u03b2 or JNK2\u03b1 decreased. The modulation of binding affinities was found to be independent of JNK-mediated M3/6 phosphorylation. Furthermore, arsenite treatment resulted in an inducible recruitment of M3/6 to JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3) scaffold complexes, while its interaction with JIP1 or JIP2 was constitutive.

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), an inherited hepatic disorder, is due to a defect of hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), an enzyme involved in heme biosynthesis. AIP is characterized by recurrent, life-threatening attacks at least partly due to the increased hepatic production of 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA). Both the mitochondrial enzyme, ALA synthase (ALAS) 1, involved in the first step of heme biosynthesis, which is closely linked to mitochondrial bioenergetic pathways, and the promise of an ALAS1 siRNA hepatic therapy in humans, led us to investigate hepatic energetic metabolism in Hmbs KO mice treated with phenobarbital. The mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were explored in the Hmbs(-/-) mouse model. RC and TCA cycle were significantly affected in comparison to controls in mice treated with phenobarbital with decreased activities of RC complexes I (-52%, (**)p<0.01), II (-50%, (**)p<0.01) and III (-55%, (*)p<0.05), and decreased activity of \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (-64%, (*)p<0.05), citrate synthase (-48%, (**)p<0.01) and succinate dehydrogenase (-53%, (*)p<0.05). Complex II-driven succinate respiration was also significantly affected. Most of these metabolic alterations were at least partially restored after the phenobarbital arrest and heme arginate administration. These results suggest a cataplerosis of the TCA cycle induced by phenobarbital, caused by the massive withdrawal of succinyl-CoA by ALAS induction, such that the TCA cycle is unable to supply the reduced cofactors to the RC. This profound and reversible impact of AIP on mitochondrial energetic metabolism offers new insights into the beneficial effect of heme, glucose and ALAS1 siRNA treatments by limiting the cataplerosis of TCA cycle."

METHODS To induce colitis, C57BL/6J mice were administered 3.0% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in their drinking water for 5 days and were subsequently given drinking water alone. RESULTS A total of 77 and 92 metabolites were detected in serum and colon tissue, respectively, and among the metabolites the compositions of TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids changed depending on the degree of colitis. Then, partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), a multiple classification analysis, showed distinct clustering and clear separation of the groups according to the degree of colitis. Furthermore, PLS-DA loadings plots revealed that succinic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, glutamic acid, and glutamine were the main contributors to the separation of each stage of colitis. In addition, it was revealed that supplementation with glutamine, the level of which was significantly decreased in the acute phase of colonic inflammation, attenuated colitis induced by DSS.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES While animal studies have implicated derangements of global energy homeostasis in the pathogenesis of acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH), the relevance of these findings to the development of human AAH remains unclear. Using global, unbiased serum metabolomics analysis, we sought to characterize alterations in metabolic pathways associated with severe AAH and identify potential biomarkers for disease prognosis. METHODS This prospective, case-control study design included 25 patients with severe AAH and 25 ambulatory patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Serum samples were collected within 24 hours of the index clinical encounter. Global, unbiased metabolomics profiling was performed. Patients were followed for 180 days after enrollment to determine survival. RESULTS Levels of 234 biochemicals were altered in subjects with severe AAH. Random-forest analysis, principal component analysis, and integrated hierarchical clustering methods demonstrated that metabolomics profiles separated the two cohorts with 100% accuracy. Severe AAH was associated with enhanced triglyceride lipolysis, impaired mitochondrial fatty acid beta oxidation, and upregulated omega oxidation. Low levels of multiple lysolipids and related metabolites suggested decreased plasma membrane remodeling in severe AAH. While most measured bile acids were increased in severe AAH, low deoxycholate and glycodeoxycholate levels indicated intestinal dysbiosis. Several changes in substrate utilization for energy homeostasis were identified in severe AAH, including increased glucose consumption by the pentose phosphate pathway, altered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, and enhanced peptide catabolism. Finally, altered levels of small molecules related to glutathione metabolism and antioxidant vitamin depletion were observed in patients with severe AAH. Univariable logistic regression revealed 15 metabolites associated with 180-day survival in severe AAH. CONCLUSION Severe AAH is characterized by a distinct metabolic phenotype spanning multiple pathways. Metabolomics profiling revealed a panel of biomarkers for disease prognosis, and future studies are planned to validate these findings in larger cohorts of patients with severe AAH."

BACKGROUND While acute lung injury (ALI) contributes significantly to critical illness, it resolves spontaneously in many instances. The majority of patients experiencing ALI require mechanical ventilation. Therefore, we hypothesized that mechanical ventilation and concomitant stretch-exposure of pulmonary epithelia could activate endogenous pathways important in lung protection. METHODS AND FINDINGS To examine transcriptional responses during ALI, we exposed pulmonary epithelia to cyclic mechanical stretch conditions--an in vitro model resembling mechanical ventilation. A genome-wide screen revealed a transcriptional response similar to hypoxia signaling. Surprisingly, we found that stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1A) during stretch conditions in vitro or during ventilator-induced ALI in vivo occurs under normoxic conditions. Extension of these findings identified a functional role for stretch-induced inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in mediating normoxic HIF1A stabilization, concomitant increases in glycolytic capacity, and improved tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function. Pharmacologic studies with HIF activator or inhibitor treatment implicated HIF1A-stabilization in attenuating pulmonary edema and lung inflammation during ALI in vivo. Systematic deletion of HIF1A in the lungs, endothelia, myeloid cells, or pulmonary epithelia linked these findings to alveolar-epithelial HIF1A. In vivo analysis of \u00b9\u00b3C-glucose metabolites utilizing liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry demonstrated that increases in glycolytic capacity, improvement of mitochondrial respiration, and concomitant attenuation of lung inflammation during ALI were specific for alveolar-epithelial expressed HIF1A. CONCLUSIONS These studies reveal a surprising role for HIF1A in lung protection during ALI, where normoxic HIF1A stabilization and HIF-dependent control of alveolar-epithelial glucose metabolism function as an endogenous feedback loop to dampen lung inflammation."

The ketone bodies \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) support mammalian survival during states of energy deficit by serving as alternative sources of ATP. BHB levels are elevated by starvation, caloric restriction, high-intensity exercise, or the low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet. Prolonged fasting reduces inflammation; however, the impact that ketones and other alternative metabolic fuels produced during energy deficits have on the innate immune response is unknown. We report that BHB, but neither AcAc nor the structurally related short-chain fatty acids butyrate and acetate, suppresses activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to urate crystals, ATP and lipotoxic fatty acids. BHB did not inhibit caspase-1 activation in response to pathogens that activate the NLR family, CARD domain containing 4 (NLRC4) or absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome and did not affect non-canonical caspase-11, inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, BHB inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by preventing K(+) efflux and reducing ASC oligomerization and speck formation. The inhibitory effects of BHB on NLRP3 are not dependent on chirality or starvation-regulated mechanisms like AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy or glycolytic inhibition. BHB blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome without undergoing oxidation in the TCA cycle, and independently of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), sirtuin-2 (SIRT2), the G protein-coupled receptor GPR109A or hydrocaboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2). BHB reduces NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 production in human monocytes. In vivo, BHB or a ketogenic diet attenuates caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion in mouse models of NLRP3-mediated diseases such as Muckle-Wells syndrome, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and urate crystal-induced peritonitis. Our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of caloric restriction or ketogenic diets may be linked to BHB-mediated inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome."

Metabolic reprogramming is implicated in macrophage activation, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the NOTCH1 pathway dictates activation of M1 phenotypes in isolated mouse hepatic macrophages (HMacs) and in a murine macrophage cell line by coupling transcriptional upregulation of M1 genes with metabolic upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ROS (mtROS) to augment induction of M1 genes. Enhanced mitochondrial glucose oxidation was achieved by increased recruitment of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD1) to nuclear and mitochondrial genes that encode respiratory chain components and by NOTCH-dependent induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (Pdp1) expression, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, and glucose flux to the TCA cycle. As such, inhibition of the NOTCH pathway or Pdp1 knockdown abrogated glucose oxidation, mtROS, and M1 gene expression. Conditional NOTCH1 deficiency in the myeloid lineage attenuated HMac M1 activation and inflammation in a murine model of alcoholic steatohepatitis and markedly reduced lethality following endotoxin-mediated fulminant hepatitis in mice. In vivo monocyte tracking further demonstrated the requirement of NOTCH1 for the migration of blood monocytes into the liver and subsequent M1 differentiation. Together, these results reveal that NOTCH1 promotes reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism for M1 macrophage activation."

In particular, they contribute to the regulation of local energy metabolism and to oxidative stress defence. In previous experiments, we showed that long-term treatment with interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) alone increases glucose utilization in primary culture of mouse astrocytes. In our study, we report that a combination of IL-1beta and TNFalpha exerts a synergistic effect on glucose utilization and markedly modifies the metabolic phenotype of astrocytes. Thus, IL-1beta+TNFalpha treated astrocytes show a marked decrease in glycogen levels, a slight but not significant decrease in lactate release as well as a massive increase in both the pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle activities. Glutamate-stimulated glucose utilization and lactate release, a typical feature of astrocyte energy metabolism, are altered after pretreatment with IL-1beta+TNFalpha. As far as mechanisms for oxidative stress defence are concerned, we observed that treatment with IL-1beta+TNFalpha decreases cellular glutathione content and increases glutathione release into the extracellular space while stimulating superoxide anion and nitric oxide production as well as H(2)O(2) release. Interestingly, stimulation of glucose utilization by IL-1beta+TNFalpha is not affected by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine, suggesting that cellular stress does not account for this effect. Finally, the effects of cytokines on glucose utilization appear to involve multiple signaling cascades including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Taken together these results establish that a proinflammatory environment such as observed in several neuropathological conditions including Alzheimer's disease, markedly modifies the metabolic phenotype of astrocytes."

BACKGROUND The dinucleotide relative abundance profile can be regarded as a genomic signature because, despite diversity between species, it varies little between 50 kilobase or longer windows on a given genome. Both the causes and the functional significance of this phenomenon could be illuminated by determining if it persists on smaller scales. The profile is computed from the base step \"odds ratios\" that compare dinucleotide frequencies to those expected under the assumption of stochastic equilibrium (thorough shuffling). Analysis is carried out on 22 sequences, representing 19 species and comprised of about 53 million bases all together, to assess stability of the signature in windows ranging in size from 50 kilobases down to 125 bases. RESULTS Dinucleotide relative abundance distance from the global signature is computed locally for all non-overlapping windows on each sequence. These distances are log-normally distributed with nearly constant variance and with means that tend to zero slower than reciprocal square root of window size. The mean distance within genomes is larger for protist, plant, and human chromosomes, and smaller for archaea, bacteria, and yeast, for any window size. CONCLUSIONS The imprint of the global signature is locally pervasive on all scales considered in the sequences (either genomes or chromosomes) that were scanned."

Twenty-eight completely sequenced bacterial genomes were included in the study. The correlation between the genomic signature and DNA-DNA hybridisation values was high and taxa that showed less than 30% DNA-DNA binding will in general not have dinucleotide relative abundance dissimilarity (delta*) values below 40. On the other hand, taxa showing more than 50% DNA-DNA binding will not have delta* values higher than 17. Our data indicate that the overall correlation between genomic signature and 16S rDNA sequence similarity is low, except for closely related organisms (16S rDNA similarity >94%). Statistical analysis of delta* values between different subgroups of the Proteobacteria indicate that the beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria are more closely related to each other than to the other subgroups of the Proteobacteria and that the alpha- and epsilon-Proteobacteria form clearly separate subgroups.

In the post genomic era, access to complete genome sequence data for numerous diverse species has opened multiple avenues for examining and comparing primary DNA sequence organization of entire genomes. Previously, the concept of a genomic signature was introduced with the observation of species-type specific Dinucleotide Relative Abundance Profiles (DRAPs); dinucleotides were identified as the subsequences with the greatest bias in representation in a majority of genomes. Herein, we demonstrate that DRAP is one particular genomic signature contained within a broader spectrum of signatures. Within this spectrum, an alternative genomic signature, Chaos Game Representation (CGR), provides a unique visualization of patterns in sequence organization. A genomic signature is associated with a particular integer order or subsequence length that represents a measure of the resolution or granularity in the analysis of primary DNA sequence organization. We quantitatively explore the organizational information provided by genomic signatures of different orders through different distance measures, including a novel Image Distance. The Image Distance and other existing distance measures are evaluated by comparing the phylogenetic trees they generate for 26 complete mitochondrial genomes from a diversity of species. The phylogenetic tree generated by the Image Distance is compatible with the known relatedness of species. Quantitative evaluation of the spectrum of genomic signatures may be used to ultimately gain insight into the determinants and biological relevance of the genome signatures."

On this basis we refer to the collection (rho*XY) as the genome signature. This paper identifies rho*XY extremes and compares genome signature differences for a diverse range of eukaryotic species. Interpretations on the mechanisms maintaining these profile differences center on genome-wide replication, repair, DNA structures, and context-dependent mutational biases. It is also observed that mitochondrial genome signature differences between species parallel the corresponding nuclear genome signature differences despite large differences between corresponding mitochondrial and nuclear signatures.

These include seven complete genomes (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, Methanococcus jannaschii, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum). A key observation concerns the constancy of the dinucleotide relative abundance profiles over multiple 50-kb disjoint contigs within the same genome. (The profile is rhoXY* = fXY*/fX*fY* for all XY, where fX* denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X and fY* denotes the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, both computed from the sequence concatenated with its inverted complementary sequence.) On the basis of this constancy, we refer to the collection [rhoXY*] as the genome signature. We establish that the differences between [rhoXY*] vectors of 50-kb sample contigs of different genomes virtually always exceed the differences between those of the same genomes. Various di- and tetranucleotide biases are identified. In particular, we find that the dinucleotide CpG=CG is underrepresented in many thermophiles (e.g., M. jannaschii, Sulfolobus sp., and M. thermoautotrophicum) but overrepresented in halobacteria. TA is broadly underrepresented in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but normal counts appear in Sulfolobus and P. aerophilum sequences. More than for any other bacterial genome, palindromic tetranucleotides are underrepresented in H. influenzae. The M. jannaschii sequence is unprecedented in its extreme underrepresentation of CTAG tetranucleotides and in the anomalous distribution of CTAG sites around the genome. Comparative analysis of numbers of long tetranucleotide microsatellites distinguishes H. influenzae. Dinucleotide relative abundance differences between bacterial sequences are compared. For example, in these assessments of differences, the cyanobacteria Synechocystis, Synechococcus, and Anabaena do not form a coherent group and are as far from each other as general gram-negative sequences are from general gram-positive sequences. The difference of M. jannaschii from low-G+C gram-positive proteobacteria is one-half of the difference from gram-negative proteobacteria. Interpretations and hypotheses center on the role of the genome signature in highlighting similarities and dissimilarities across different classes of prokaryotic species, possible mechanisms underlying the genome signature, the form and level of genome compositional flux, the use of the genome signature as a chronometer of molecular phylogeny, and implications with respect to the three putative eubacterial, archaeal, and eukaryote domains of life and to the origin and early evolution of eukaryotes."

BACKGROUND Whilst maternal age is an established risk factor for Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Down syndrome (trisomy 21), the aetiology and contribution of genetic and environmental factors remains unclear. We analysed for space-time clustering using high quality fully population-based data from a geographically defined region. METHODS The study included all cases of Patau, Edwards and Down syndrome, delivered during 1985-2003 and resident in the former Northern Region of England, including terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. We applied the K-function test for space-time clustering with fixed thresholds of close in space and time using residential addresses at time of delivery. The Knox test was used to indicate the range over which the clustering effect occurred. Tests were repeated using nearest neighbour (NN) thresholds to adjust for variable population density. RESULTS The study analysed 116 cases of Patau syndrome, 240 cases of Edwards syndrome and 1084 cases of Down syndrome. There was evidence of space-time clustering for Down syndrome (fixed threshold of close in space: P = 0.01, NN threshold: P = 0.02), but little or no clustering for Patau (P = 0.57, P = 0.19) or Edwards (P = 0.37, P = 0.06) syndromes. Clustering of Down syndrome was associated with cases from more densely populated areas and evidence of clustering persisted when cases were restricted to maternal age <40 years.

SETTING Data from 22 EUROCAT congenital anomaly registers in 12 European countries. PARTICIPANTS Diagnoses with observed or (for terminations) predicted year of birth from 1980 to 2005, comprising live births, fetal deaths with gestational age \u2265 20 weeks and terminations after prenatal diagnosis of the anomaly. Data include 374 cases of Patau syndrome, 929 of Edwards syndrome, 295 of Klinefelter syndrome, 28 of XYY syndrome and 5627 controls with Down syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Odds ratio (OR) associated with a 10-year increase in paternal age for each anomaly was estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results were adjusted to take account of the estimated association of paternal age with Down syndrome (1.11; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23). RESULTS The OR for Patau syndrome was 1.10 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.45); for Edwards syndrome, 1.15 (0.96 to 1.38); for Klinefelter syndrome, 1.35 (1.02 to 1.79); and for XYY syndrome, 1.99 (0.75 to 5.26). CONCLUSIONS There was a statistically significant increase in the odds of Klinefelter syndrome with increasing paternal age. The larger positive associations of Klinefelter and XYY syndromes with paternal age compared with Patau and Edwards syndromes are consistent with the greater percentage of these sex chromosome anomalies being of paternal origin."

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficiency of the second trimester screening for fetal chromosomal anomaly using maternal serum marker. METHOD 27,313 pregnant women with the gestational age of 15 - 20 weeks were selected by stratified combined with cluster sampling from 13 counties over Jiangsu province and 5 townships, towns, or subdistricts from 6 randomly selected cities from southern, central, and northern Jiangsu, totally 95 communities, between July 2002 and November 2006. Questionnaire survey was conducted. Body weight was taken. Ultrasonography was used to confirm the gestational age. Peripheral blood samples were collected to detect the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (f-betaHCG). The risk values of Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome were calculated. The women at high risk of Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome for their fetuses were recommended to receive genetic counseling and amniocentesis. All babies were followed up until six months to four years of age after birth. RESULTS 26,803 of the 27,313 women (98%) were screened. The average was 25.1, and 1.7% of them were over 35. Serum screening showed that 1,244 (5%) were Down syndrome positive and 105 (0.4%) were Edwards syndrome positive. The final pregnant outcomes showed that 20 cases presented chromosomal abnormalities, of which 9 cases suffered from Down syndrome, 5 cases Edwards syndrome, and 6 cases other chromosomal abnormalities. The detection rate of Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome were 56% and 80% respectively. CONCLUSION Under good quality control high prenatal detection rate of fetal chromosomal abnormalities can be reached by screening of maternal serum AFP and f-betaHCG during the second pregnancy trimester. Good cost-effectiveness depends on the incidence of targeted birth defects."

BACKGROUND Maternal serum triple marker screening (alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol) can detect 60-70% of Down syndrome and 60% of Edwards syndrome. Previous studies have reported that positive serum screening is related to other fetal chromosomal abnormalities, pregnancy complications, and adverse outcomes. We determined the incidence and karyotype of chromosomal abnormalities in screen positive women and evaluated a relationship between chromosomal and ultrasonographic abnormalities. METHODS Of the 49,806 pregnant women between 15 and 23 weeks' gestational age who received prenatal serum screening with a cut-off value (a risk of 1:270 for Down and 1:100 for Edwards syndrome), 2,116 (4.2%) and 196 (0.4%) were screen positive for Down syndrome and for Edwards syndrome, respectively. Chromosomal analysis in amniotic fluid was performed for 1,893 (89.5%) of the Down positive and 140 (71.4%) of the Edwards positive pregnant women. Ultrasonographic examination was performed to detect fetal abnormalities. RESULTS Eighty-three cases of chromosomal abnormalities including 40 trisomy 21 (2.1%) and 43 other chromosomal abnormalities (2.3%) were identified in the Down screen positive. Other chromosomal abnormalities included 9 numerical and 34 structural abnormalities. Ten cases of chromosomal abnormalities (9 trisomy 18 and 1 trisomy 9) were detected in the Edwards screen positive. Ultrasonographic abnormalities were found more frequently in the women who had chromosomal aberrations. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that 4.4% of the Down screen and 7.1% of the Edwards screen positive pregnancy have fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Positive Down screening results reflect a relatively high probability of other abnormalities except trisomy 21. Edwards screen positive group show a low frequency of other chromosomal abnormalities except trisomy 18. A simultaneous use of maternal serum screening and ultrasonograms could be useful for the diagnosis of fetal abnormalities."

Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) occurs in 1: 8000 live births and is closely related to the mother's age. Most of the embryos and fetuses with trisomy of 18 chromosome pair undergo natural abortion. Change in number and structure of chromosomes usually takes place spontaneously. However, the incidence of chromosome mutations increases with the presence of mutagenic factors. One of the chemical mutagenic factors is benzopyrene - present in cigarette smoke. Prenatal cytogenetic diagnostic is used for detecting diseases and clinical syndromes conditioned by chromosome aberrations. To this date the \"golden standard\" of this diagnostic is the assessment of the fetus karyotype by means of analysis of chromosome banding pattern from amniotic fluid-derived cells. The aim of the study was the analysis of indications for genetic amniocenteses carried out in the last 5 years and in case of which trisomy of chromosome 18 (Edwards syndrome) was diagnosed. The analysis covered 1593 results of fetus karyotypes obtained from Cytogenetic Laboratory of the Central Gynecological-Obstetric Clinical Hospital in Pozna\u0144 over the last 5 years. The study procedure consisted in producing cell culture from amniotic fluid, appliance of appropriate color techniques and thorough microscopic analysis of chromosome banding pattern. As a result of the analysis it was discovered that in 1538 cases the karyotype was normal, and in 55 cases trisomy 18 was diagnosed, which constituted 3% of all cytogenetic tests. The highest number of trisomy 18 cases was noted in 2009 - 19 cases, which constitutes 5% of all tests. In 2010 and 2011 the results included respectively 2% and 3% of diagnosed trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome).

MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on pre- and postnatally diagnosed birth defects in the Czech Republic during 1994-2007 were used. Data on prenatally diagnosed birth defects (and for terminated pregnancies) were collected from particular departments of prenatal diagnostics, medical genetics and ultrasound diagnostics in the Czech Republic, data on birth defects in births from the National Birth Defects Register (Institute for Health Information and Statistics). Total numbers over the period under the study, mean incidences of selected types of chromosomal aberrations and mean prenatal diagnostics efficiencies were analyzed. Following chromosomal aberrations were studied: Down, Edwards, Patau, Turner and Klinefelter syndromes and syndromes 47,XXX and 47,XYY. RESULTS A relative proportion of Down, Edwards and Patau syndromes as well as other autosomal and gonosomal aberration is presented in figures. Recently, trisomies 13, 18 and 21 present around 70% of all chromosomal aberrations in selectively aborted fetuses, in other pregnancies, \"other chromosomal aberrations\" category (mostly balanced reciprocal translocations and inversions) present more than 2/3 of all diagnoses. During the period under the study, following total numbers, mean relative incidences (per 10,000 live births, in brackets) and mean prenatal diagnostics efficiency (in %) were found in following chromosomal syndromes: Down syndrome 2,244 (16.58) and 63.37%, Edwards syndrome 521 (3.85) and 79.93%, Patau syndrome 201 (1.49) and 68.87%, Turner syndrome 380 (2.81) and 79.89%, 47,XXX syndrome 61 (0.45) and 59.74%, Klinefelter syndrome 163 (1.20) and 73.65% and 47,XYY syndrome 22 (0.16) and 54.76%. CONCLUSIONS The study gives updated results of incidences analysis of both pre- and postnatally diagnosed chromosomal birth defects in the Czech Republic during the 1994-2007 period. Incidences found in our study correspond (in case of trisomies 13, 18 and 21) with those published widely in literature as well as with those found in large-scale international studies (ICBDSR, EUROCAT). In case of gonosomal aberrations, incidences found in this study are lower that those published, most probably due to a later registration (over 15 years of age of the child) of these diagnoses."

SUBJECTS 235 pregnancies of women delivered in units in the North West Thames region over a two-year period (1990-91) whose babies or fetuses were diagnosed as having Down, Edwards or Patau syndrome. RESULTS 33% of Down syndrome, 68% of Edwards syndrome and 52% of Patau syndrome were diagnosed prenatally (before 28 weeks) in the region without the use of serum screening. CONCLUSIONS Using maternal age and routine ultrasound as screening methods, units in the region are prenatally diagnosing significantly fewer Down syndrome babies than are those in authorities using serum screening. The use of maternal age and ultrasound screening is more effective for the antenatal detection of the other autosomal trisomies than it is for the detection of Down syndrome.

TYPE OF STUDY Retrospective epidemiological analysis of birth defects incidences in births and total birth defects incidences (including prenatally diagnosed cases) from the Czech National Birth Defects Register database. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data from the National Birth Defects Register (Institute for Health Information and Statistics) in the Czech Republic in the 2000 - 2008 period were used along with data on prenatally diagnosed defects from particular departments of medical genetics. Sixteen selected defects (anencephaly, spina bifida, encephalocele, congenital hydrocephalus, coarctation of aorta, transposition of great vessels, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Fallot tetralogy, omphalocele, gastroschisis, diaphragmatic hernia, oesophageal atresia and stenosis, anorectal malformations, Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome) were analyzed in detail. RESULTS There were 119 570 live births (61 326 boys and 58 244 girls) in 2008. In the same period, 4664 live births with a birth defect (under the age of one year) were reported, out of which 2754 boys and 1910 girls. Mean incidence was 390.06 (449.08 in boys and 327.93 in girls) per 10 000 live births. In 1994 - 2006, totally 1 238 398 children were born, out of which more than 42 000 with a birth defect. In the 2000 - 2006 period, absolute numbers of diagnosed live births with birth defect varied between 3600 - 3800 cases per year while in 2007 and 2008 years absolute numbers raised over 4600 cases per year. During 2000 - 2008 period following mean incidences (per 10 000 live births) of selected defects were ascertained (total incidences including prenatal diagnostics in brackets): anencephaly 0 - 0.3 (1.9 - 3.7), spina bifida 0.7 - 2.3 (3.2 - 5.2), encephalocele 0.1 - 0.4 (0.9 - 2.4), congenital hydrocephalus 1.6 - 3.5 (5.3 - 7.0), coarctation of aorta 3.9 - 5.2 (4.8 - 6.1), transposition of great vessels 2.9 - 4.5 (3.2 - 5.0), hypoplastic left heart syndrome 0.7 - 2.3 (2.2 - 4.3), Fallot tetralogy 2.6 - 4.0 (3.2 - 4.4), omphalocele 1.0 - 1.7 (1.8 - 3.8), gastroschisis 0.2 - 1.2 (2.4 - 3.4), diaphragmatic hernia 1.3 - 2.9 (1.5 - 3.9), Down syndrome 3.3 - 6.5 (15.8 - 22.2), Edwards syndrome 0.2 - 1.0 (3.5 - 5.8) and Patau syndrome 0.2 - 1.0 (1.2 - 2.6). CONCLUSIONS There has been no major change in birth defect incidences in live births in the Czech Republic in last years. Number of non-viable defects has decreased in stillbirths and in perinatal mortality in the Czech Republic. An incidence of some defects has decreased mostly due to a nation-wide system of prenatal diagnostics; some incidences remain stable in live-birth population in others incidences have increased. A total incidence has mostly increased (anencephaly being an exception) mostly due to an earlier prenatal diagnostics. In chromosomal syndromes, an increasing maternal age as well as a growing number of mothers of 35 years of age and over has contributed to the increased incidences."

For several decades, apoptosis, the first genetically programmed death process to be identified has taken centre stage as the principal mechanism of programmed cell death (type I cell death) in mammalian tissues. Apoptosis has been extensively studied and its contribution to the pathogenesis of disease well documented. However, apoptosis does not function alone in determining the fate of a cell. More recently, autophagy, a process in which de novo formed membrane enclosed vesicles engulf and consume cellular components, has been shown to engage in complex interplay with apoptosis. As a result, cell death has been subdivided into the categories apoptosis (Type I), autophagic cell death (Type II), and necrosis (Type III). The boundary between Type I and II cell death is not completely clear and as we will discuss in this review and perhaps a discrete difference does not exist, due to intrinsic factors among different cell types and crosstalk among organelles within each cell type. Apoptosis may begin with autophagy and autophagy can often end with apoptosis, inhibition or a blockade of caspase activity may lead a cell to default into Type II cell death from Type I."

The current working definition of autophagy is the following: all processes in which intracellular material is degraded within the lysosome/vacuole and where the macromolecular constituents are recycled. There are several ways to classify the different types of autophagy. For example, we can separate autophagy into two primary types, based on the initial site of cargo sequestration. In particular, during microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy, uptake occurs directly at the limiting membrane of the lysosome or vacuole. In contrast, macroautophagy-whether selective or nonselective-and endosomal microautophagy involve sequestration within an autophagosome or an omegasome, or late endosomes/multivesicular bodies, respectively; the key point being that in these types of autophagy the initial sequestration event does not occur at the limiting membrane of the degradative organelle. In any case, the cargo is ultimately delivered into the lysosome or vacuole lumen for subsequent degradation. Thus, I think most autophagy researchers view the degradative organelle as the ultimate destination of the pathway. Indeed, this fits with the general concept that organelles allow reactions to be compartmentalized. With regard to the lysosome or vacuole, this also confers a level of safety by keeping the lytic contents away from the remainder of the cell. If we are willing to slightly modify our definition of autophagy, with a focus on \"degradation of a cell's own components through the lysosomal/vacuolar machinery,\" we can include a newly documented process, programmed nuclear destruction (PND)."

Autophagy is a catabolic trafficking pathway for bulk destruction and turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles via regulated lysosomal degradation. In eukaryotic cells, autophagy occurs constitutively at low levels to perform housekeeping functions, such as the destruction of dysfunctional organelles. Up-regulation occurs in the presence of external stressors (e.g. starvation, hormonal imbalance and oxidative stress) and internal needs (e.g. removal of protein aggregates), suggesting that the process is an important survival mechanism. However, the occurrence of autophagic structures in dying cells of different organisms has led to the hypothesis that autophagy may also have a causative role in stress-induced cell death. The identification within the last decade of a full set of genes essential for autophagy in yeast, the discovery of human orthologues and the definition of signalling pathways regulating autophagy have accelerated our molecular understanding and interest in this fundamental process. A growing body of evidence indicates that autophagy is associated with heart disease, cancer and a number of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that autophagy plays a role in embryogenesis, aging and immunity. Recently, it has been shown that autophagy can be intensified by specific drugs. The pharmacological modulation of the autophagic pathway represents a major challenge for clinicians to treat human disease."

With regard to cell biology, one area of focus that has shifted back and forth over the years has been the relative emphasis on catabolic versus anabolic processes: the breakdown of glucose, the synthesis of DNA, the oxidation of pyruvate, the biogenesis of membranes, protein degradation, and protein synthesis. Historically, the majority of studies concerned with degradation dealt with the production of energy; however, the analysis of the ubiquitin-proteasome system revealed the importance of protein degradation for controlling various aspects of cell physiology. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is limited primarily to targeting individual proteins for destruction, but cells also have to deal with larger structures that are damaged, potentially toxic or superfluous, and these substrates, including entire organelles, are the purview of autophagy. As a general definition, autophagy encompasses a range of processes in which the cell degrades parts of itself within the lysosome (or the analogous organelle, the vacuole, in yeast and plants), followed by the release and reuse of the breakdown products. Thus, autophagy is in part a mechanism for cellular recycling, but such a definition belies the importance of the different autophagic processes in cell and organismal function and homeostasis. Indeed, defects in autophagy are associated with many human diseases and metabolic disorders. Here, we provide a brief overview of the mechanism of autophagy and some of the physiological roles in which this process is involved."

Autophagy has been predominantly studied as a nonselective self-digestion process that recycles macromolecules and produces energy in response to starvation. However, autophagy independent of nutrient status has long been known to exist. Recent evidence suggests that this form of autophagy enforces intracellular quality control by selectively disposing of aberrant protein aggregates and damaged organelles--common denominators in various forms of neurodegenerative diseases. By definition, this form of autophagy, termed quality-control (QC) autophagy, must be different from nutrient-regulated autophagy in substrate selectivity, regulation and function. We have recently identified the ubiquitin-binding deacetylase, HDAC6, as a key component that establishes QC. HDAC6 is not required for autophagy activation per se; rather, it is recruited to ubiquitinated autophagic substrates where it stimulates autophagosome-lysosome fusion by promoting F-actin remodeling in a cortactin-dependent manner. Remarkably, HDAC6 and cortactin are dispensable for starvation-induced autophagy. These findings reveal that autophagosomes associated with QC are molecularly and biochemically distinct from those associated with starvation autophagy, thereby providing a new molecular framework to understand the emerging complexity of autophagy and therapeutic potential of this unique machinery."

It is nonetheless suggested here that tonoplast rupture and the subsequent rapid destruction of the cytoplasm can distinguish two large PCD classes. One class, which is here called 'autolytic', shows this feature, whilst the second class (called 'non-autolytic') can include tonoplast rupture but does not show the rapid cytoplasm clearance. Examples of the 'autolytic' PCD class mainly occur during normal plant development and after mild abiotic stress. The 'non-autolytic' PCD class is mainly found during PCD that is due to plant-pathogen interactions. Three categories of PCD are currently recognized in animals: apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis. An attempt is made to reconcile the recognized plant PCD classes with these groups. Apoptosis is apparently absent in plants. Autophagic PCD in animals is defined as being accompanied by an increase in the number of autophagosomes, autolysosomes, and small lytic vacuoles produced by autolysosomes. When very strictly adhering to this definition, there is no (proof for) autophagic PCD in plants. Upon a slightly more lenient definition, however, the 'autolytic' class of plant PCD can be merged with the autophagic PCD type in animal cells.

Studies of oncogene activation in normal fibroblasts as well as exposure of tumor cells to chemotherapy have indicated that autophagy and senescence are closely related but not necessarily interdependent responses; specifically, interference with autophagy delays but does not abrogate senescence. The literature relating to this topic is inconclusive, with some reports appearing to be consistent with a direct relationship between autophagy and senescence and others indicative of an inverse relationship. Before this question can be resolved, additional studies will be necessary where autophagy is clearly inhibited by genetic silencing and where the temporal responses of both autophagy and senescence are monitored, preferably in cells that are intrinsically incapable of apoptosis or where apoptosis is suppressed.

In view of the human therapeutic use of DEX, and considering that no difference in the number and/or affinity of glucocorticoid receptors in activated and non-activated lymphocytes has been reported, we decided to evaluate the effect of DEX on fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Transmission electron microscopy showed that DEX can significantly induce apoptosis in non-activated PBMC. It was also observed by transmission electron microscopy that, independently of DEX treatment, PBMC also died by a process marked by extreme vacuolization and increase in cellular volume; these cells were erroneously classified as viable by flow cytometry using the 7-AAD assay. It is concluded that the DEX pro-apoptotic effect is not restricted to activated PBMC and, therefore, DEX-induced apoptosis could play either homeostatic (activated PBMC) or immunosuppressive (non-activated PBMC) roles."

BACKGROUND The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell effector mechanisms that limits immune responses against cancer. We tested the anti-PD-1 antibody lambrolizumab (previously known as MK-3475) in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS We administered lambrolizumab intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks in patients with advanced melanoma, both those who had received prior treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and those who had not. Tumor responses were assessed every 12 weeks. RESULTS A total of 135 patients with advanced melanoma were treated. Common adverse events attributed to treatment were fatigue, rash, pruritus, and diarrhea; most of the adverse events were low grade. The confirmed response rate across all dose cohorts, evaluated by central radiologic review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25 to 44), with the highest confirmed response rate observed in the cohort that received 10 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks (52%; 95% CI, 38 to 66). The response rate did not differ significantly between patients who had received prior ipilimumab treatment and those who had not (confirmed response rate, 38% [95% CI, 23 to 55] and 37% [95% CI, 26 to 49], respectively). Responses were durable in the majority of patients (median follow-up, 11 months among patients who had a response); 81% of the patients who had a response (42 of 52) were still receiving treatment at the time of analysis in March 2013. The overall median progression-free survival among the 135 patients was longer than 7 months. CONCLUSIONS In patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had had disease progression while they had been receiving ipilimumab, treatment with lambrolizumab resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects.

Over the last several years, there has been considerable progress in the treatment of cancer using gene modified adoptive T cell therapies.

In this review, we focus on one aspect of TCR-mediated adoptive T cell therapies, the impact of the affinity of the \u03b1\u03b2 TCR for the pepMHC cancer antigen on both efficacy and specificity. We discuss the advantages of higher-affinity TCRs in mediating potent activity of CD4 T cells. This is balanced with the potential disadvantage of higher-affinity TCRs in mediating greater self-reactivity against a wider range of structurally similar antigenic peptides, especially in synergy with the CD8 co-receptor. Both TCR affinity and target selection will influence potential safety issues. We suggest pre-clinical strategies that might be used to examine each TCR for possible on-target and off-target side effects due to self-reactivities, and to adjust TCR affinities accordingly."

The aim of therapeutic dendritic cell (DC) vaccines in cancer immunotherapy is to activate cytotoxic T cells to recognize and attack the tumor. T cell activation requires the interaction of the T cell receptor with a cognate major-histocompatibility complex-peptide complex. Although initiated by antigen engagement, it is the complex balance between co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory signals on DCs that results in T cell activation or tolerance. Even when already activated, tumor-specific T cells can be neutralized by the expression of co-inhibitory molecules on tumor cells. These and other immunosuppressive cues in the tumor microenvironment are major factors currently hampering the application of DC vaccination. In this review, we discuss recent data regarding the essential and complex role of co-inhibitory molecules in regulating the immune response within the tumor microenvironment. In particular, possible therapeutic intervention strategies aimed at reversing or neutralizing suppressive networks within the tumor microenvironment will be emphasized. Importantly, blocking co-inhibitory molecule signaling, often referred to as immune checkpoint blockade, does not necessarily lead to an effective activation of tumor-specific T cells. Therefore, combination of checkpoint blockade with other immune potentiating therapeutic strategies, such as DC vaccination, might serve as a synergistic combination, capable of reversing effector T cells immunosuppression while at the same time increasing the efficacy of T cell-mediated immunotherapies. This will ultimately result in long-term anti-tumor immunity."

These drugs are the new standard of care, however barriers to better patient outcomes include limited responses and significant toxicities (CTLA4 antibodies) and lack of durability in the majority of cases (BRAF and MEK inhibitors). This review discusses the next stages of development of treatments in melanoma, including immune checkpoint blocking drugs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, and the use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in combination. Both approaches lead to a higher proportion of durable responses coupled with less toxicity.

Imprinted genes play important roles in the regulation of growth and development, and several have been shown to influence behavior. Their allele-specific expression depends on inheritance from either the mother or the father, and is regulated by \"imprinting control regions\" (ICRs). ICRs are controlled by DNA methylation, which is present on one of the two parental alleles only. These allelic methylation marks are established in either the female or the male germline, following the erasure of preexisting DNA methylation in the primordial germ cells. After fertilization, the allelic DNA methylation at ICRs is maintained in all somatic cells of the developing embryo. This epigenetic \"life cycle\" of imprinting (germline erasure, germline establishment, and somatic maintenance) can be disrupted in several human diseases, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome and Hydatidiform mole. In the neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome, the way the ICR mediates imprinted expression is perturbed.

Many of these are involved in foetal growth and deve lopment, others control behaviour. Mono-allelic expression of imprinted genes depends on whether the gene is inherited from the mother or the father. This remarkable pattern of expression is controlled by specialized sequence elements called ICRs (imprinting control regions). ICRs are marked by DNA methylation on one of the two parental alleles. These allelic marks originate from either the maternal or the paternal germ line. Perturbation of the allelic DNA methylation at ICRs is causally involved in several human diseases, including the Beckwith-Wiedemann and Silver-Russell syndromes, associated with aberrant foetal growth. Perturbed imprinted gene expression is also implicated in the neuro-developmental disorders Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. Embryo culture and human-assisted reproduction procedures can increase the occurrence of imprinting-related disorders. Recent research shows that, besides DNA methylation, covalent histone modifications and non-histone proteins also contribute to imprinting regulation.

Parental genomic imprinting is the phenomenon in which the behavior of a gene is modified, depending on the sex of the transmitting parent [Peterson and Sapienza (1993): Annu Rev Genet 27:7-31]. Recent observations have revealed that the inheritance patterns, age-of-onset, severity, and etiology of certain human diseases can be explained by aberrations in the establishment or the maintenance of the imprint. Examples include the Prader-Willi, Angelman, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes [Nicholls (1994): Am J Hum Genet 54:733-740], malignancy [Sapienza (1990): Biochim Biophys Acta 1072:51-61; Feinberg (1993): Nat Genet 4:110-113], and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) [Julier et al.

We review the evidence that implicates an imprinted gene in the INS-IGF2 region of chromosome 11p15 in the etiology of IDDM (referred to as the IDDM2 locus) and show that in human fetal pancreas, INS is not imprinted, thus providing an argument against INS as the candidate gene. We also examine imprinting effects on the expression of IGF2 in components of the human immune system believed to be important in IDDM and show imprinted expression in fetal thymus as early as 15 weeks gestation. We demonstrate further that in the circulating mononuclear cells of two individuals, lectin-stimulated IGF2 transcription was biallelic, indicating relaxation of imprinting, whereas in one individual, transcription was monoallelic. Finally, we review the current available data supporting a role for insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) in the immune system and, more specifically, discuss the evidence supporting a role for the IGFs in the prevention of apoptosis. These data have led us to formulate a novel hypothesis that could mechanistically explain the involvement of the IDDM2 locus in the pathogenesis of IDDM."

OBJECTIVES The aims were to analyze whether the levels of self-reported bruxism and anxiety associate among otherwise healthy subjects, and to investigate the independent effects of anxiety and stress experience on the probability of self-reported bruxism. STUDY DESIGN As part of a study on irregular shift work, a questionnaire was mailed to all employees of the Finnish Broadcasting Company with irregular shift work (number of subjects: n=750) and to an equal number of randomly selected employees in the same company with regular eight-hour daytime work. RESULTS The response rates were 82.3% (56.6 % men) and 34.3 % (46.7 % men), respectively. Among the 874 respondents, those aware of more frequent bruxism reported significantly more severe anxiety (p<0.001). Adjusted by age and gender, frequent bruxers were more than two times more likely to report severe stress (odds ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval 1.5-4.2) and anxiety (odds ratio 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.3-3.6) than non-or-mild bruxers. CONCLUSIONS Present findings suggest that self-reported bruxism and psychological states such as anxiety or stress may be related in working age subjects."

Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) episodes were observed most frequently, with single short-burst episodes the second most frequent. The frequencies of RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes were significantly higher during decreased esophageal pH episodes than those during other times. Both the electromyography and the decreased esophageal pH episodes were most frequently observed in the supine position.

Bruxism is a pathological activity of the stomatognathic system that involves tooth grinding and clenching during parafunctional jaw movements. Clinical signs of bruxism are mostly related to dental wear and muscular and joint discomforts, but a large number of etiological factors can be listed, as local, systemic, psychological and hereditary factors. The association between bruxism, feeding and smoking habits and digestive disorders may lead to serious consequences to dental and related structures, involving dental alterations (wear, fractures and cracks), periodontal signs (gingival recession and tooth mobility) and muscle-joint sensitivity, demanding a multidisciplinary treatment plan. This paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes. From the diagnosis, a multidisciplinary treatment plan was established. The initial treatment approach consisted of medical follow up with counseling on diet and smoking habits and management of the gastric disorders. This was followed by the installation of an interocclusal acrylic device in centric relation of occlusion (CRO) for reestablishment of the occlusal stability, vertical dimension of occlusion, anterior guides and return to normal muscle activity (90-day use approximately). After remission of initial symptoms, oral rehabilitation was implemented in CRO by means of full resin composite restorations and new interocclusal device for protection of restorations. Satisfactory esthetics, improved function and occlusal stability were obtained after oral rehabilitation. The patient has attended annual follow-ups for the past 2 years. The multidisciplinary treatment seems to be the key for a successful rehabilitation of severe cases of dental wear involving the association of different health disorders."

At the tooth level, 72.2% of 1,078 teeth wore <15 \u03bcm over a 6-month period. At the subject level, 77.7% of 63 participants showed median wear <15 \u03bcm over a 6-month period. There was a statistical trend towards tooth wear progression being associated with gastric risk factors (p < 0.05). The lower molars and the upper anterior teeth were the most commonly affected teeth; the lower molars and the upper central incisors were the most severely affected teeth. Tooth wear progression was slow in this cohort, suggesting that tooth wear may be cyclical and inactive in the majority of participants."

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (SB), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, no robust evidence supports the association between SB and GERD. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between SB and GERD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-five individuals were eligible to participate in this observational transversal study at the Gastroenterology Service of the Clinical Hospital of Porto Alegre, Brazil. The participants were classified into 2 groups, those with and without GERD, according to the Montreal Criteria and pH-metry/endoscopy findings. The diagnosis of SB was not assessed in a sleep laboratory but was based on self-report plus clinical inspection, according to the minimal diagnostic criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The Lipp Stress Symptom Inventory was used to evaluate self-perceived stress. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed with SB as dependent variable and GERD, sex, age, body mass index, and stress as predictors (\u03b1=.05; 90% power). RESULTS The study population included individuals with SB without GERD (13.3%) and individuals with SB with GERD (31.1%). In participants with GERD, the prevalence of SB was 73.7%. Only the variable GERD was significantly associated with SB (P=.017; odds ratio 6.58; 95% confidence interval 1.40-30.98), although adjusted for stress and age. CONCLUSIONS Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB."

PARTICIPANTS Ten patients with bruxism and 10 normal subjects were matched for height, weight, age, and sex. They did not have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. INTERVENTION Medication with a proton pump inhibitor (ie, a gastric-acid-inhibiting drug). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The bruxism group showed a significantly higher frequency of nocturnal rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) episodes (mean +/- SD: 6.7 +/- 2.2 times per hour) and a higher frequency and percentage of time of gastroesophageal reflux episodes with a pH less than 4.0 and 5.0 (0.5 +/- 0.9 and 3.6 +/- 1.6 times per hour and 1.3% +/- 2.5% and 7.4% +/- 12.6%, respectively) than the control group (RMMA episodes: 2.4 +/- 0.9 times per hour; gastroesophageal reflux episodes: 0.0 +/- 0.0 and 0.1 +/- 0.3 times per hour and 0.0% +/- 0.0% and 0.0% +/- 0.0%, respectively). In the bruxism group, 100% of the gastroesophageal reflux episodes with a pH less than 3.0 and 4.0 included both an RMMA episode and an electromyographic burst, the duration of which was approximately 0.5 to 1.0 seconds, probably representing swallowing of saliva. The majority of gastroesophageal reflux episodes with a pH of 4.0 to 5.0 also included both an RMMA episode and an electromyographic burst in the control and bruxism groups (100% +/- 0.0% vs 70.7% +/- 16.5%), again probably due to swallowing of saliva. The remaining minority of gastroesophageal reflux episodes with a pH of 4.0 to 5.0 contained only an electromyographic burst (swallowing of saliva). The frequency of RMMA episodes after the release of the medication from the proton pump inhibitor, which increased the gastric and esophageal pH, was significantly lower than that after administration of the placebo in the control and bruxism groups (1.0 +/- 0.6 vs 1.9 +/- 3.2 times per hour, and 3.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 6.0 +/- 2.2 times per hour, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Nocturnal bruxism may be secondary to nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, occurring via sleep arousal and often together with swallowing. The physiologic link between bruxism and the increase in salivation needs to be investigated."

After his medical treatment, severe tooth wear, bruxism and decreased vertical dimensions were determined. The vertical dimension was re-established and maxillary and mandibular anterior and posterior teeth were prepared for metal-ceramic restorations. Metal-ceramic fixed partial dentures were fabricated as full mouth restorations for both maxillary and mandibular arches because of splinting all teeth. And then maxillary stabilization splint was fabricated for his bruxism history. CONCLUSION Significant loss of coronal tooth structure must taken into consideration. Gastroesophageal reflux disease by itself or in combination with attrition, abrasion or bruxism may be responsible for the loss.

BACKGROUND Early clinical studies suggested that the anti-interleukin-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody brodalumab has efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis. METHODS In two phase 3 studies (AMAGINE-2 and AMAGINE-3), patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis were randomly assigned to receive brodalumab (210 mg or 140 mg every 2 weeks), ustekinumab (45 mg for patients with a body weight \u2264100 kg and 90 mg for patients >100 kg), or placebo. At week 12, patients receiving brodalumab were randomly assigned again to receive a brodalumab maintenance dose of 210 mg every 2 weeks or 140 mg every 2 weeks, every 4 weeks, or every 8 weeks; patients receiving ustekinumab continued to receive ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and patients receiving placebo received 210 mg of brodalumab every 2 weeks. The primary aims were to evaluate the superiority of brodalumab over placebo at week 12 with respect to at least a 75% reduction in the psoriasis area-and-severity index score (PASI 75) and a static physician's global assessment (sPGA) score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear skin), as well as the superiority of brodalumab over ustekinumab at week 12 with respect to a 100% reduction in PASI score (PASI 100). RESULTS At week 12, the PASI 75 response rates were higher with brodalumab at the 210-mg and 140-mg doses than with placebo (86% and 67%, respectively, vs. 8% [AMAGINE-2] and 85% and 69%, respectively, vs. 6% [AMAGINE-3]; P<0.001); the rates of sPGA scores of 0 or 1 were also higher with brodalumab (P<0.001). The week 12 PASI 100 response rates were significantly higher with 210 mg of brodalumab than with ustekinumab (44% vs. 22% [AMAGINE-2] and 37% vs. 19% [AMAGINE-3], P<0.001). The PASI 100 response rates with 140 mg of brodalumab were 26% in AMAGINE-2 (P=0.08 for the comparison with ustekinumab) and 27% in AMAGINE-3 (P=0.007). Rates of neutropenia were higher with brodalumab and with ustekinumab than with placebo. Mild or moderate candida infections were more frequent with brodalumab than with ustekinumab or placebo. Through week 52, the rates of serious infectious episodes were 1.0 (AMAGINE-2) and 1.3 (AMAGINE-3) per 100 patient-years of exposure to brodalumab. CONCLUSIONS Brodalumab treatment resulted in significant clinical improvements in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

The IL-17 pathway is an established driver of psoriasis pathogenesis. We examined the detailed molecular and cellular effects of blockade of IL-17 signaling in human psoriatic skin before and following treatment with brodalumab, a competitive inhibitor of the IL-17 Receptor A subunit. Thousands of aberrantly expressed genes in lesional skin normalized within 2 weeks following brodalumab treatment, with conversion of the lesional psoriasis transcriptome to resemble that seen in nonlesional skin. Keratinocyte-expressed genes appeared to normalize rapidly, whereas T cell-specific normalization occurred over six weeks. The three IL-17 ligand genes that are upregulated in lesional skin, IL17A, IL17C, and IL17F, were all downregulated in a dose-dependent manner following brodalumab treatment. Cellular measures also showed a similar pattern with dramatic decreases in keratinocyte hyperplasia within one week, and decreases in infiltrating leukocytes occurred over a longer timescale. Individuals with the highest brodalumab exposure showed normalization of both IL-17-responsive genes and the psoriasis transcriptome, whereas subjects with lower exposures showed transient or incomplete molecular responses. Clinical and molecular response appeared dependent on the extent of brodalumab exposure relative to the expression of IL-17 ligand genes, and reduction of IL-17 signaling into the nonlesional range was strongly correlated with normalization of the psoriasis transcriptome. These data indicate that blockade of IL-17 signaling in psoriatic skin leads to rapid transcriptomal changes initially in keratinocyte-expressed genes, followed by normalization in the leukocyte abnormalities, and demonstrates the essential role of the IL-17R on keratinocytes in driving disease pathogenesis."

OBJECTIVES To determine efficacy and safety of brodalumab, a human anti-IL-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody, in subjects with inadequately controlled moderate to severe asthma taking regular inhaled corticosteroids. METHODS Three hundred two subjects were randomized to brodalumab (140, 210, or 280 mg) or placebo. Primary endpoint was change in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score from baseline to Week 12. Secondary endpoints included FEV1, symptom scores, and symptom-free days. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential responsive subpopulations. Analyses included randomized subjects receiving one or more doses of investigational product using last-observation-carried-forward imputation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced among groups (n = 302; n = 226 brodalumab). For the overall study population, no treatment differences were observed. Nine prespecified subgroups were examined without corrections for multiple testing. In only the high-reversibility subgroup (post-bronchodilator FEV1 improvement \u2265 20%; n = 112) was an ACQ change with nominal significance noted; ACQ responses were nominally significant in the 210-mg group (estimated treatment difference, 0.53) but not significant in the higher 280-mg group (estimated treatment difference, 0.38). Adverse events, generally balanced among groups, were most commonly asthma, upper respiratory tract infection, and injection site reaction. CONCLUSIONS Inhibition of IL-17 receptor A did not produce a treatment effect in subjects with asthma. The results of the high-reversibility subgroup analysis are of uncertain significance, requiring further study of brodalumab in this asthma subpopulation.

Preclinical studies suggest that IL-17 is a desirable therapeutic target for psoriasis treatment. METHODS We reviewed the results of the phase II clinical trials for the anti-IL-17 agents secukinumab, ixekizumab and brodalumab in order to assess the efficacy and safety profile of each agent. RESULTS By week 12, the proportion of patients reaching Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) was comparable among the most efficacious dosage between the different agents (secukinumab 82%, ixekizumab 83% and brodalumab 82%; p<0.001 compared to placebo for all agents). The safety profiles of the agents were similar with the most frequently reported adverse events of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory infections and injection site reaction. A small percentage of patients experienced low-grade neutropenia that was predominantly transient and asymptomatic. CONCLUSION The anti-IL-17 agents demonstrated a rapid and robust clinical improvement accompanied by a favorable short-term safety profile.

BACKGROUND We assessed the efficacy and safety of brodalumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-17 receptor A (IL17RA), in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving patients with psoriatic arthritis. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with active psoriatic arthritis to receive brodalumab (140 or 280 mg subcutaneously) or placebo on day 1 and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. At week 12, patients who had not discontinued their participation in the study were offered open-label brodalumab (280 mg) every 2 weeks. The primary end point was 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR 20) at week 12. RESULTS Of the 168 patients who underwent randomization (57 in the brodalumab 140-mg group, 56 in the brodalumab 280-mg group, and 55 in the placebo group), 159 completed the double-blind phase and 134 completed 40 weeks of the open-label extension. At week 12, the brodalumab 140-mg and 280-mg groups had higher rates of ACR 20 than the placebo group (37% [P=0.03] and 39% [P=0.02], respectively, vs. 18%); they also had higher rates of 50% improvement (ACR 50) (14% [P=0.05] and 14% [P=0.05] vs. 4%). Rates of 70% improvement were not significantly higher in the brodalumab groups. Similar degrees of improvement were noted among patients who had received previous biologic therapy and those who had not received such therapy. At week 24, ACR 20 response rates in the brodalumab 140-mg and 280-mg groups were 51% and 64%, respectively, as compared with 44% among patients who switched from placebo to open-label brodalumab; responses were sustained through week 52. At week 12, serious adverse events had occurred in 3% of patients in the brodalumab groups and in 2% of those in the placebo group.

These diseases include psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, the broader category of spondyloarthritides including ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is postulated that in genetically predisposed individuals, external or internal stimuli such as microbial antigens, alterations in the intestinal microbiome, biomechanical stress and/or immunologic dysregulation may lead to an increased expression of cytokines such as IL23, which in turn stimulate the differentiation and activation of TH17 and other immune cells, which are a part of the innate immune system that trigger adaptive immune processes and chronic inflammatory diseases. Herein, we explore the effect of targeting this pathway therapeutically. RECENT FINDINGS New drugs that are designed to inhibit steps in this pathway, the IL12/IL23 inhibitor, ustekinumab, the IL17A inhibitors secukinumab and ixekizumab, the IL17A receptor inhibitor, brodalumab, and the IL23 inhibitors guselkumab and tildrakizumab, have demonstrated significant effectiveness in treating these diseases, particularly psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. SUMMARY This article reviews the relevant biology, efficacy and safety of new medications targeting the TH17 pathway, including inhibition of IL17 and IL23, particularly in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Especially for patients who have not gained benefit from, lost effectiveness to or could not use antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) medications for safety or tolerability reasons, having effective medicines with an alternative mechanism of action will improve our ability to diminish disease activity impact on patient lives."

Current biologic therapies are highly effective in the treatment of psoriasis, transforming the lives of patients with this significantly disabling disease. Advances in the understanding of the immunological pathogenesis of psoriasis have led to the development of new biologic therapies, targeting specific inflammatory cytokines upregulated in psoriasis. These include the IL-17 antagonists, secukinumab, brodalumab and ixekizumab; the IL-23 antagonists, guselkumab and tildrakizumab; and the oral small molecule therapies, tofacitinib and apremilast.

There is some evidence that the cytokine interleukin-17A (often known as IL-17), which is mainly produced by Th17 cells, has a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. \"IL-17\" is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly important in the host's defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. The three new therapies with biologic drugs - brodalumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab - all target the IL-17 signaling pathway. Secukinumab and ixekizumab neutralize IL-17A, while brodalumab blocks its receptor. Results from clinical trials have shown marked improvements in disease severity in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, using any of these three drugs. The biologic agents were generally well tolerated, but the duration of the trials was relatively short. In this review, we focus on the role of the IL-17 cytokine family in the pathogenesis of psoriasis; the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brodalumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab in clinical trials; and possible differences between targeting of the IL-17A receptor and targeting of the IL-17A ligand."

BACKGROUND In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of brodalumab (AMG 827), a human anti-interleukin-17-receptor monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with a score of 12 or higher on the psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI, on which scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating more severe disease) and with 10% or more of their body-surface area affected by psoriasis to receive brodalumab (70 mg, 140 mg, or 210 mg at day 1 and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 or 280 mg monthly) or placebo. The primary end point was the percentage improvement from baseline in the PASI score at week 12. Secondary end points included improvement of at least 75% and at least 90% in the PASI score and the score on the static physician's global assessment at week 12. RESULTS A total of 198 patients underwent randomization. At week 12, the mean percentage improvements in the PASI score were 45.0% among patients receiving 70 mg of brodalumab, 85.9% among those receiving 140 mg, 86.3% among those receiving 210 mg, 76.0% among those receiving 280 mg, and 16.0% among those receiving placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). An improvement of at least 75% and at least 90% in the PASI score at week 12 was seen in 77% and 72%, respectively, of the patients in the 140-mg brodalumab group and in 82% and 75%, respectively, of the patients in the 210-mg group, as compared with 0% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The percentage of patients with a static physician's global assessment of clear or minimal disease was 26%, 85%, 80%, and 69% with the 70-mg, 140-mg, 210-mg, and 280-mg doses, respectively, of brodalumab, as compared with 3% with placebo (P<0.01 for all comparisons with placebo). Two cases of grade 3 neutropenia were reported in the 210-mg brodalumab group. The most commonly reported adverse events in the combined brodalumab groups were nasopharyngitis (8%), upper respiratory tract infection (8%), and injection-site erythema (6%). CONCLUSIONS Brodalumab significantly improved plaque psoriasis in this 12-week, phase 2 study. (Funded by Amgen; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975637.)."

In this study we investigated the correlation between dinucleotide relative abundance values (the genomic signature) obtained from bacterial whole-genome sequences and two parameters widely used for bacterial classification, 16S rDNA sequence similarity and DNA-DNA hybridisation values. Twenty-eight completely sequenced bacterial genomes were included in the study. The correlation between the genomic signature and DNA-DNA hybridisation values was high and taxa that showed less than 30% DNA-DNA binding will in general not have dinucleotide relative abundance dissimilarity (delta*) values below 40. On the other hand, taxa showing more than 50% DNA-DNA binding will not have delta* values higher than 17. Our data indicate that the overall correlation between genomic signature and 16S rDNA sequence similarity is low, except for closely related organisms (16S rDNA similarity >94%). Statistical analysis of delta* values between different subgroups of the Proteobacteria indicate that the beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria are more closely related to each other than to the other subgroups of the Proteobacteria and that the alpha- and epsilon-Proteobacteria form clearly separate subgroups.

The profile is computed from the base step \"odds ratios\" that compare dinucleotide frequencies to those expected under the assumption of stochastic equilibrium (thorough shuffling). Analysis is carried out on 22 sequences, representing 19 species and comprised of about 53 million bases all together, to assess stability of the signature in windows ranging in size from 50 kilobases down to 125 bases. RESULTS Dinucleotide relative abundance distance from the global signature is computed locally for all non-overlapping windows on each sequence. These distances are log-normally distributed with nearly constant variance and with means that tend to zero slower than reciprocal square root of window size. The mean distance within genomes is larger for protist, plant, and human chromosomes, and smaller for archaea, bacteria, and yeast, for any window size. CONCLUSIONS The imprint of the global signature is locally pervasive on all scales considered in the sequences (either genomes or chromosomes) that were scanned."

In the post genomic era, access to complete genome sequence data for numerous diverse species has opened multiple avenues for examining and comparing primary DNA sequence organization of entire genomes. Previously, the concept of a genomic signature was introduced with the observation of species-type specific Dinucleotide Relative Abundance Profiles (DRAPs); dinucleotides were identified as the subsequences with the greatest bias in representation in a majority of genomes. Herein, we demonstrate that DRAP is one particular genomic signature contained within a broader spectrum of signatures. Within this spectrum, an alternative genomic signature, Chaos Game Representation (CGR), provides a unique visualization of patterns in sequence organization. A genomic signature is associated with a particular integer order or subsequence length that represents a measure of the resolution or granularity in the analysis of primary DNA sequence organization. We quantitatively explore the organizational information provided by genomic signatures of different orders through different distance measures, including a novel Image Distance. The Image Distance and other existing distance measures are evaluated by comparing the phylogenetic trees they generate for 26 complete mitochondrial genomes from a diversity of species. The phylogenetic tree generated by the Image Distance is compatible with the known relatedness of species. Quantitative evaluation of the spectrum of genomic signatures may be used to ultimately gain insight into the determinants and biological relevance of the genome signatures."

Eukaryotic genome similarity relationships are inferred using sequence information derived from large aggregates of genomic sequences. Comparisons within and between species sample sequences are based on the profile of dinucleotide relative abundance values (The profile is rho*XY = f*XY/f*Xf*Y for all XY, where f*X denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X and f*XY denotes the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, both computed from the sequence concatenated with its inverted complement). Previous studies with respect to prokaryotes and this study document that profiles of different DNA sequence samples (sample size >/=50 kb) from the same organism are generally much more similar to each other than they are to profiles from other organisms, and that closely related organisms generally have more similar profiles than do distantly related organisms. On this basis we refer to the collection (rho*XY) as the genome signature. This paper identifies rho*XY extremes and compares genome signature differences for a diverse range of eukaryotic species. Interpretations on the mechanisms maintaining these profile differences center on genome-wide replication, repair, DNA structures, and context-dependent mutational biases. It is also observed that mitochondrial genome signature differences between species parallel the corresponding nuclear genome signature differences despite large differences between corresponding mitochondrial and nuclear signatures. The genome signature differences also have implications for contrasts between rodents and other mammals, and between monocot and dicot plants, as well as providing evidence for similarities among fungi and the diversity of protists."

Various methods have been developed to detect horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, based on anomalous nucleotide composition, assuming that compositional features undergo amelioration in the host genome. Evolutionary theory predicts the inevitability of false positives when essential sequences are strongly conserved. Foreign genes could become more detectable on the basis of their higher order compositions if such features ameliorate more rapidly and uniformly than lower order features. This possibility is tested by comparing the heterogeneities of bacterial genomes with respect to strand-independent first- and second-order features, (i) G + C content and (ii) dinucleotide relative abundance, in 1 kb segments. Although statistical analysis confirms that (ii) is less inhomogeneous than (i) in all 12 species examined, extreme anomalies with respect to (ii) in the Escherichia coli K12 genome are typically co-located with essential genes."

Strand compositional asymmetry is not observed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. genome nor in the archaeal genomes of Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. A strong strand compositional asymmetry is observed in beta-type but not alpha- or gamma-type human herpesviruses featuring G > C downstream of oriL and C > G upstream of oriL. Dinucleotide relative abundances (i.e., dinucleotide representations normalized by the component nucleotide frequencies) are consonant with respect to the leading and lagging strands. Strand compositional asymmetry may reflect on differences in replication synthesis of the leading versus lagging strand, on differences between template and coding strand associated with transcription-coupled repair mechanisms, on differences in gene density between the two strands, on differences in residue and codon biases in relation to gene function, expression level, or operon organization, or on differences in single or context-dependent base mutational rates.

These include seven complete genomes (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, Methanococcus jannaschii, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum). A key observation concerns the constancy of the dinucleotide relative abundance profiles over multiple 50-kb disjoint contigs within the same genome. (The profile is rhoXY* = fXY*/fX*fY* for all XY, where fX* denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X and fY* denotes the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, both computed from the sequence concatenated with its inverted complementary sequence.) On the basis of this constancy, we refer to the collection [rhoXY*] as the genome signature. We establish that the differences between [rhoXY*] vectors of 50-kb sample contigs of different genomes virtually always exceed the differences between those of the same genomes. Various di- and tetranucleotide biases are identified. In particular, we find that the dinucleotide CpG=CG is underrepresented in many thermophiles (e.g., M. jannaschii, Sulfolobus sp., and M. thermoautotrophicum) but overrepresented in halobacteria. TA is broadly underrepresented in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but normal counts appear in Sulfolobus and P. aerophilum sequences. More than for any other bacterial genome, palindromic tetranucleotides are underrepresented in H. influenzae. The M. jannaschii sequence is unprecedented in its extreme underrepresentation of CTAG tetranucleotides and in the anomalous distribution of CTAG sites around the genome. Comparative analysis of numbers of long tetranucleotide microsatellites distinguishes H. influenzae. Dinucleotide relative abundance differences between bacterial sequences are compared. For example, in these assessments of differences, the cyanobacteria Synechocystis, Synechococcus, and Anabaena do not form a coherent group and are as far from each other as general gram-negative sequences are from general gram-positive sequences. The difference of M. jannaschii from low-G+C gram-positive proteobacteria is one-half of the difference from gram-negative proteobacteria. Interpretations and hypotheses center on the role of the genome signature in highlighting similarities and dissimilarities across different classes of prokaryotic species, possible mechanisms underlying the genome signature, the form and level of genome compositional flux, the use of the genome signature as a chronometer of molecular phylogeny, and implications with respect to the three putative eubacterial, archaeal, and eukaryote domains of life and to the origin and early evolution of eukaryotes."

BACKGROUND Transcranial Doppler (TCD) CO2-reactivity and oxygen-15 positron emission tomography (PET) have both been used to measure the cerebral haemodynamic state in patients who may have a compromised blood flow. Our purpose was to investigate whether PET and TCD identify the same patients with an impaired flow state of the brain in patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion. METHODS Patients with recent transient ischaemic attack or minor ischaemic stroke associated with ICA occlusion underwent TCD with measurement of CO2-reactivity and oxygen-15 PET within a median time interval of 6 days. RESULTS We included 24 patients (mean age 64 \u00b1 10 years). Seventeen (71%) patients had impaired CO2-reactivity (\u226420%), of whom six had absent reactivity (0%) or steal (<0%) in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion. PET of the perfusion state of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion demonstrated stage 1 haemodynamic compromise (decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) or increased cerebral blood volume (CBV) without increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF)) in 13 patients and stage 2 (increased OEF) in 2 patients. In 12 patients (50%), there was agreement between TCD and PET, indicating haemodynamic compromise in 10 and a normal flow state of the brain in 2 patients. There was no significant correlation between CO2-reactivity and CBF ipsilateral/contralateral hemispheric ratio (r = 0.168, p value = 0.432), OEF ratio (r = -0.242, p value = 0.255), or CBV/CBF ratio (r = -0.368, p value = 0.077).

METHODS Increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) by positron emission tomography is a gold standard for ischemia, but the specific thresholds and equivalency of the semiquantitative OEF ratio utilized in COSS and quantitative OEF are at issue. RESULTS The semiquantitative hemispheric OEF ratio used in COSS did not identify the same group of patients as did quantitative OEF using a threshold of 50%.

Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is a major cause of ischemic stroke worldwide and represents a significant health problem. The pathogenesis and natural history of ICAD are poorly understood, and rigorous treatment paradigms do not exist as they do for extracranial atherosclerosis. Currently, the best treatment for ICAD remains aspirin therapy, but many patients who are placed on aspirin continue to experience recurrent strokes. As microsurgical and endovascular techniques continue to evolve, the role of extracranial to intracranial bypass operations and stenting are increasingly being reconsidered. We performed a PubMed review of the English literature with a particular focus on treatment options for ICAD and present evidence-based data for the role of surgery and stenting in ICAD against medical therapy alone."

CONTEXT Patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic internal carotid artery occlusion (AICAO) and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia are at high risk for subsequent stroke when treated medically. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery, added to best medical therapy, reduces subsequent ipsilateral ischemic stroke in patients with recently symptomatic AICAO and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia. DESIGN Parallel-group, randomized, open-label, blinded-adjudication clinical treatment trial conducted from 2002 to 2010. SETTING Forty-nine clinical centers and 18 positron emission tomography (PET) centers in the United States and Canada. The majority were academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS Patients with arteriographically confirmed AICAO causing hemispheric symptoms within 120 days and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia identified by ipsilateral increased oxygen extraction fraction measured by PET. Of 195 patients who were randomized, 97 were randomized to receive surgery and 98 to no surgery. Follow-up for the primary end point until occurrence, 2 years, or termination of trial was 99% complete. No participant withdrew because of adverse events. INTERVENTIONS Anastomosis of superficial temporal artery branch to a middle cerebral artery cortical branch for the surgical group. Antithrombotic therapy and risk factor intervention were recommended for all participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE For all participants who were assigned to surgery and received surgery, the combination of (1) all stroke and death from surgery through 30 days after surgery and (2) ipsilateral ischemic stroke within 2 years of randomization. For the nonsurgical group and participants assigned to surgery who did not receive surgery, the combination of (1) all stroke and death from randomization to randomization plus 30 days and (2) ipsilateral ischemic stroke within 2 years of randomization. RESULTS The trial was terminated early for futility. Two-year rates for the primary end point were 21.0% (95% CI, 12.8% to 29.2%; 20 events) for the surgical group and 22.7% (95% CI, 13.9% to 31.6%; 20 events) for the nonsurgical group (P = .78, Z test), a difference of 1.7% (95% CI, -10.4% to 13.8%). Thirty-day rates for ipsilateral ischemic stroke were 14.4% (14/97) in the surgical group and 2.0% (2/98) in the nonsurgical group, a difference of 12.4% (95% CI, 4.9% to 19.9%). CONCLUSION Among participants with recently symptomatic AICAO and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia, EC-IC bypass surgery plus medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone did not reduce the risk of recurrent ipsilateral ischemic stroke at 2 years.

OBJECT The Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) was conducted to determine if superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass, when added to the best medical therapy, would reduce subsequent ipsilateral stroke in patients with complete internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and an elevated oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in the cerebral hemisphere distal to the occlusion. A recent publication documented the methodology of the COSS in detail and briefly outlined the major findings of the trial. The surgical results of the COSS are described in detail in this report. METHODS The COSS was a prospective, parallel-group, 1:1 randomized, open-label, blinded-adjudication treatment trial. Participants, who had angiographically demonstrated complete occlusion of the ICA causing either a transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke within 120 days and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia indicated by an increased OEF measured by PET, were randomized to either surgical or medical treatment. One hundred ninety-five patients were randomized: 97 to the surgical group and 98 to the medical group. The surgical patients underwent an STA-MCA cortical branch anastomosis. RESULTS In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 2-year rates for the primary end point were 21% for the surgical group and 22.7% for the medical group (p = 0.78, log-rank test). Fourteen (15%) of the 93 patients who had undergone an arterial bypass had a primary end point ipsilateral hemispheric stroke in the 30-day postoperative period, 12 within 2 days after surgery. The STA-MCA arterial bypass patency rate was 98% at the 30-day postoperative visit and 96% at the last follow-up examination. The STA-MCA arterial bypass markedly improved, although it did not normalize, the level of elevated OEF in the symptomatic cerebral hemisphere. Five surgically treated and 1 nonsurgically treated patients in the surgical group had a primary end point ipsilateral hemispheric stroke after the 30-day postoperative period. No baseline characteristics or intraoperative variables revealed those who would experience a procedure-related stroke. CONCLUSIONS Despite excellent bypass graft patency and improved cerebral hemodynamics, STA-MCA anastomosis did not provide an overall benefit regarding ipsilateral 2-year stroke recurrence, mainly because of a much better than expected stroke recurrence rate (22.7%) in the medical group, but also because of a significant postoperative stroke rate (15%).

OBJECT The Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) was a large, prospective clinical trial that examined whether superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass, in addition to best medical therapy, reduced the risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke in patients with carotid artery occlusion and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia. Despite improved cerebral hemodynamics and excellent bypass graft patency rates, COSS failed to show a benefit for the surgical group with respect to ipsilateral stroke recurrence at 2 years after treatment. This was due to a lower than expected rate of recurrent ipsilateral stroke in the medically treated group and a high rate of perioperative ipsilateral strokes in the surgical group. Critics of the trial have cited surgeon inexperience and technical difficulties related to the performance of the bypass graft as a leading cause of failure of the trial. METHODS The authors retrospectively identified all patients from the COSS with an ipsilateral, perioperative (< 30 days) ischemic stroke after STA-MCA cortical branch anastomosis. Study records, operative notes, stroke adjudication forms, and imaging studies were reviewed. Ischemic strokes were characterized as bypass graft related or non-bypass graft related based on clinical and radiographic findings. RESULTS Fourteen of 93 surgically treated patients experienced an ipsilateral, perioperative ischemic stroke. Postoperatively, the mean oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebral hemisphere significantly improved in these patients (1.30 \u00b1 0.18 preoperative vs 1.12 \u00b1 0.11 postoperative; p = 0.02), but did not normalize. In this cohort, total MCA occlusion time during the anastomosis (54.3 \u00b1 23.5 minutes) was no different from the MCA occlusion time in those surgical patients who did not have a perioperative stroke (45.4 \u00b1 24.2 minutes, p = 0.2). Bypass graft patency rates in patients with a perioperative stroke were 92% at 30 days (11 of 12 patients with patency data) and 83% at last follow-up visit (10 of 12 patients with patency data). These patency rates were not significantly different from those achieved at 30 days (100%; 76 of 76 patients with patency data; p = 0.14) and at last follow-up (99%; 71 of 72 patients with patency data; p = 0.052) in patients without a perioperative stroke. Eighty-six percent (12 of 14 patients) of strokes were likely attributable to factors unrelated to the STA-MCA anastomosis. Only 21% of strokes (3 of 14 patients) were in the territory of the recipient vessel and likely related to technical performance of the anastomosis itself. One patient was thought to have dual stroke mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS Only a small minority of ipsilateral, perioperative ischemic strokes in the COSS could be attributed to technical problems of the bypass anastomosis. The majority of ischemic strokes could not be ascribed to this cause and were most likely due to patient hemodynamic fragility and the inability of patients to tolerate surgery."

Paediatric cancer patients often experience fear and pain from the disease but also in connection with the necessary diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The treatment of pain is a priority for all patients, especially for critically ill children because of their vulnerability and limited understanding. The experience of pain is always subjective and depends on the age, the pain experience and the environment.In contrast to adults, it is often difficult to detect character of pain, pain intensity and pain localization in very young patients. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are performed in analgosedation for a given drug scheme by a pediatrician experienced in intensive care.In addition, a local anesthetic for an access system/lumbar punctures in the form of EMLA\u00ae patch is to be carried out. A rapid and effective treatment of pain and appropriate analgesia can prevent patients from being traumatized.For severe pain, malignancy- or chemotherapy-induced (eg. mucositis WHO grade 3 and 4) initial use of strong opiates is recommended instead of climbing the WHO ladder. For strong opiates, there is no maximum dose, as long as a dose increase leads to clinically observable increase in analgesia, without severe side effects. Patient-controlled analgesia with morphine as continuous subcutaneous or intravenous infusions and the possibility of a bolus injection is suited for children aged 6 years. A measurement of O2-saturation is essential during this infusion. Prophylactic approaches also must be used consistently in regard to the acute side effect of opiate treatment. Good experience, we have also made a non-drug therapy, e.g. personnel/physical affection, cuddling, massage, etc.The choice of analgesia depends on the nature and cause of pain. In neuropathic pain or phantom pain coanalgetics should be used to effectively treat pain in young patients. Different analgesic treatment approaches of the appropriate indications and adverse effects are presented. A particular challenge for the pediatrician is the sufficient and adequate pain therapy in palliative care."

BACKGROUND Pregabalin is one of the first drugs registered for the treatment of neuropathic pain. It is also indicated as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of epilepsy and for generalized anxiety disorder. Pregabalin is a GABA analogue and exerts its effect by binding to the \u03b1(2)-\u03b4 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to a decreased synaptic release of neurotransmitters. OBJECTIVE To gain insight into the safety and user profile of pregabalin in daily practice, reported by patients via a Web-based intensive monitoring system based at the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb. METHODS Lareb Intensive Monitoring is an observational prospective cohort study with no limiting inclusion or exclusion criteria compared with clinical trials. First-time users of pregabalin were identified through the first prescription signal in intensive monitoring participating pharmacies between 1 August 2006 and 31 January 2008. Eligible patients received information about the pregabalin study in the pharmacy. When registering online, patient characteristics and information about pregabalin and other concomitant drug use were collected. After registration, the patient received questionnaires by e-mail 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after the start of pregabalin. In these questionnaires, possible adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were addressed. Reactions not labelled in the Summary of Product Characteristics of pregabalin, and reactions that were labelled but were interesting for other reasons, were analysed on a case-by-case basis. RESULTS In total, 1373 patients filled in the online registration form. The average age of participants was 54.5 years (range 11-89), with 58.0% being female. The indication for pregabalin use was neuropathic pain in 85.9% of participants. The average daily dose was 201 mg, and 80.5% of all users used pregabalin capsule 75 mg. All patients who registered for the study were sent a questionnaire; 1051 (76.5%) patients filled in at least one questionnaire. There were no statistically significant differences found regarding sex, age or daily dosage between this latter group compared with the patients who registered for the study but did not fill in a questionnaire. At least one possible ADR was reported by 69.3% of patients and serious ADRs were reported by 11 patients. The five most frequently reported possible ADRs were dizziness, somnolence, feeling drunk, fatigue and increased weight. Four associations were further analysed. Headache was analysed because of its high frequency. The time to onset ranged from a few hours to 5 months, with a median time to onset of 2 days. In 15 reports the headache passed without withdrawing the drug, and in ten cases the headache disappeared after drug withdrawal. Upper abdominal pain, a possible drug interaction between pregabalin and blood glucose-lowering agents, and suicidal ideation were considered to be signals. CONCLUSIONS Web-based intensive monitoring is an observational prospective cohort study. It will therefore provide a picture of the use of pregabalin and its ADRs in daily practice. This study indicates that pregabalin is a relatively safe drug. Eleven patients (<1.0%) experienced a serious ADR while using the drug. The most frequently reported possible ADRs correspond with the reactions most frequently reported during clinical trials. The study demonstrates that a web-based intensive monitoring system can contribute to greater knowledge about a reaction, such as headache, with quantification and information about latencies and time course of the reaction. It can also detect signals worth further investigation, such as abdominal pain and possible interaction with oral antidiabetics."

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that children with terminal cancer and neuropathic pain require rapid increases of opioids and benzodiazepines immediately before death, we compared drug usage in the last 72 hours of life in children with and without neuropathic pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS Through the use of retrospective case analysis, pediatric patients with terminal cancer were divided into two groups: one with and one without neuropathic pain. Opioid and benzodiazepine dosages were recorded during the last 3 days of life. RESULTS Eighteen patients were identified: 12 with neuropathic pain and 6 without neuropathic pain. In the neuropathic group, the average dose of morphine 72 hours before death was 231 mg/kg per day and increased to 380 mg/kg per day on the day of death (P =.009). The average benzodiazepine dosage 72 hours before death was 6.0 mg/kg per day and increased to 25.0 mg/kg per day on the day of death (P =.018). In the nonneuropathic pain group, the average dose of morphine and benzodiazepine 72 hours before death was 3.0 mg/kg per day and 0.08 mg/kg per day, respectively, and did not increase substantially on the day of death.

A 12-year-old girl presented with head and neck pain, myoclonic movements, and decreased strength in all extremities caused by a cervical spinal tumor (glioblastoma multiforme). A partial resection of the tumor was performed. Three weeks later, she had superficial pain distributed in all dermatomes below her cervical medullary lesion. Touch (e.g., gentle hugs from relatives) and movements elicited paroxysm of intense pain. The pain was not relieved by increased doses of morphine. A test dose of ketamine (7.5 mg intravenous) provided an abrupt decrease in pain intensity, and continuous infusions of subcutaneous morphine and intravenous ketamine were started. Benzodiazepines were administered to avoid psychotomimetic effects from ketamine and to diminish myoclonic movements. The doses of analgesics and benzodiazepines were increasingly titrated (subcutaneous morphine 163-750 mg/24 hr, intravenous ketamine 36-410 mg/24 hr, subcutaneous midazolam 5-20 mg/24 hr, and intravenous diazepam 11.5-122.5 mg/24 hr) until her death 67 days after start of ketamine. She remained awake until the last day before her death. For the last 29 days of life, the pain treatment regimen was successfully continued in her home (400-km distance from the hospital). In conclusion, this case demonstrates that ketamine treatment may be effective in children with severe neuropathic pain not responsive to other analgesics. This patient also demonstrates the feasibility of long-term ketamine treatment in pediatric oncology and that such treatment can be administered in a home care setting."

Recent studies indicate that microRNA (miRNA) is contained within exosome. Here we sought to optimize the methodologies for the isolation and quantification of urinary exosomal microRNA as a prelude to biomarker discovery studies. Exosomes were isolated through ultracentrifugation and characterized by immunoelectron microscopy. To determine the RNA was confined inside exosomes, the pellet was treated with RNase before RNA isolation. The minimum urine volume, storage conditions for exosomes and exosomal miRNA was evaluated. The presence of miRNAs in patients with various kidney diseases was validated with real-time PCR. The result shows that miRNAs extracted from the exosomal fraction were resistant to RNase digestion and with high quality confirmed by agarose electrophoresis. 16 ml of urine was sufficient for miRNA isolation by absolute quantification with 4.15\u00d710(5) copies/ul for miR-200c. Exosomes was stable at 4\u2103 24h for shipping before stored at -80\u2103 and was stable in urine when stored at -80\u00b0C for 12 months. Exosomal miRNA was detectable despite 5 repeat freeze-thaw cycles. The detection of miRNA by quantitative PCR showed high reproducibility (>94% for intra-assay and >76% for inter-assay), high sensitivity (positive call 100% for CKD patients), broad dynamic range (8-log wide) and good linearity for quantification (R(2)>0.99). miR-29c and miR-200c showed different expression in different types of kidney disease. In summary, the presence of urinary exosomal miRNA was confirmed for patients with a diversity of chronic kidney disease. The conditions of urine collection, storage and miRNA detection determined in this study may be useful for future biomarker discovery efforts."

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) requires for its treatment permanent dialysis or kidney transplantation (KT). KT is the best clinical treatment, however, the early function of the allograft varies depending on multiple factors associated with cold ischemia time (CIT) and the allograft rejection process. It is known that serum creatinine is an insensitive and late marker for predicting graft recovery after KT, mainly in patients with delayed graft function (DGF). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is produced in the distal nephron and it is one of the most promising novel biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). NGAL has been proposed to be a predictor of organ recovery from DGF after KT from donors after cardiac death. Because nonrenal diseases can also induce NGAL, more information is necessary to validate the sensitivity and specificity of urine and plasma NGAL in clinical samples. The exosomes are vesicles released into the urine from the kidney epithelium and they have been proposed as better source to explore as biomarker of renal dysfunction. The molecular composition of the urinary exosomes could be representative of the physiological or physiopathologic condition of the urinary system. We propose that determination of NGAL in urinary exosomes is a better predictor of kidney dysfunction after KT than other urinary fractions. We analyzed 15 kidney allograft recipients, with a mean age of 36 years (range, 16-60 years) and 75% were male: 11 living donors (LD) and 4 deceased donors (DD). The average length of CIT was 14 hours in DD and less than 1 hour in LD. Three patient developed DGF. Using Western blot analysis, NGAL was detectable in the cellular and exosomal fraction of the urine. The exosomes expressed higher levels of NGAL than the cellular fraction. The expression of NGAL was observed from the first day after transplantation. In the cellular fraction of the urine, no significant differences of NGAL were observed between the patients. However, the median of NGAL expression in the exosomes fraction was significantly higher in DD patient, from the first day after KT (P < .05). Moreover, we noticed that NGAL expression in exosomes remained elevated in the patients with DGF compared with non-DGF patients (P < .05). Considering the highest abundance of NGAL in the urinary exosomes and its correlation with DGF patients, we suggest the exosomal fraction as a more sensitive substrate to evaluate early biomarkers of DGF after KT."

At the moment, the mechanism of exosome formation, the makeup of the cargo, biological pathways, and resulting functions are incompletely understood.

There is an exponentially growing need to dissect structure and the function of exosomes and utilize them for development of minimally invasive diagnostics and therapeutics. Critical to further our understanding of exosomes is the development of reagents, tools, and protocols for their isolation, characterization, and analysis of their RNA and protein contents.

BACKGROUND Exosomes are cytoplasm containing vesicles released by many cells that can be found in several biological fluids including urine. Urinary exosomes are released from every segment of the nephron, are detectable in urine, constitutively contain RNA (small RNAs and mRNAs) and harbor unique subset of proteins, reflecting their cellular source. METHODS With the aim of establishing the optimal protocol for high throughput analysis of exosomal miRNAs, we compared three different urinary exosomes isolation methods and six RNA extraction techniques. Exosomal RNA yield, size and quality were assessed respectively by specific staining with fluorescent dye, capillary electrophoresis and analysis of spectrophotometric parameters. MiRNAs detection and abundance was determined by RT-qPCR. RESULTS Among the exosomes isolation methods, Ultrafiltration resulted to be the most suited. The highest exosomal RNA yield quantified by RiboGreen\u00ae staining was obtained with the combination of TRI Reagent\u2122 with miRNeasy\u00ae, followed by TRI Reagent\u2122, SeraMir\u2122, miRCURY\u2122, mirVana\u2122 and miRNeasy\u00ae; but after a multivariate analysis, SeraMir\u2122 scored as the method of choice in terms of miRNA yield, purity and RT-qPCR miRNAs quantification accuracy. Storage conditions were also analyzed, showing that the relative abundance of urinary exosomal miRNAs is not influenced by urine freezing. CONCLUSIONS The selection of appropriate urinary exosomal miRNA isolation method was dependent on various validation results. Ultrafiltration in combination with SeraMir\u2122 exoRNA columns represents the optimal procedure for a rapid, cost-effective and efficient purification of miRNAs from urinary exosomes, perfectly suited for further applicative research in the field of miRNAs in kidney physiology and pathology."

Contamination with Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) oligomers has hampered their isolation and proteomic analysis. Here we improved ELV isolation protocols employing density centrifugation to remove THP and albumin, and isolated a glomerular membranous vesicle (GMV)-enriched subfraction from 7 individuals identifying 1830 proteins and in 3 patients with glomerular disease identifying 5657 unique proteins.

The GMVs are of podocyte origin and the density gradient technique allowed isolation in a reproducible manner. We show many nephrotic syndrome proteins, proteases, and complement proteins involved in glomerular disease are in GMVs and some were only shed in the disease state (nephrin, TRPC6, INF2 and phospholipase A2 receptor).

They contain protein and RNA from the glomerulus and all sections of the nephron and represent a reservoir for biomarker discovery. Current methods for the identification and quantification of urinary exosomes are time consuming and only semi-quantitative. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) counts and sizes particles by measuring their Brownian motion in solution. In this study, we applied NTA to human urine and identified particles with a range of sizes. Using antibodies against the exosomal proteins CD24 and aquaporin 2 (AQP2), conjugated to a fluorophore, we could identify a subpopulation of CD24- and AQP2-positive particles of characteristic exosomal size. Extensive pre-NTA processing of urine was not necessary. However, the intra-assay variability in the measurement of exosome concentration was significantly reduced when an ultracentrifugation step preceded NTA. Without any sample processing, NTA tracked exosomal AQP2 upregulation induced by desmopressin stimulation of kidney collecting duct cells. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was also able to track changes in exosomal AQP2 concentration that followed desmopressin treatment of mice and a patient with central diabetes insipidus. When urine was stored at room temperature, 4\u00b0C or frozen, nanoparticle concentration was reduced; freezing at -80\u00b0C with the addition of protease inhibitors produced the least reduction. In conclusion, with appropriate sample storage, NTA has potential as a tool for the characterization and quantification of extracellular vesicles in human urine."

Surface glycosylation profiling by flow cytometry and lectin microarray was applied to uEVs enriched from urine of healthy adults by ultracentrifugation and centrifugal filtration. The carbohydrate specificity of lectin microarray profiles was confirmed by competitive sugar inhibition and carbohydrate-specific enzyme hydrolysis. Glycosylation profiles of uEVs and purified Tamm Horsfall protein were compared. In both flow cytometry and lectin microarray assays, uEVs demonstrated surface binding, at low to moderate intensities, of a broad range of lectins whether prepared by ultracentrifugation or centrifugal filtration. In general, ultracentrifugation-prepared uEVs demonstrated higher lectin binding intensities than centrifugal filtration-prepared uEVs consistent with lesser amounts of co-purified non-vesicular proteins. The surface glycosylation profiles of uEVs showed little inter-individual variation and were distinct from those of Tamm Horsfall protein, which bound a limited number of lectins. In a pilot study, lectin microarray was used to compare uEVs from individuals with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease to those of age-matched controls. The lectin microarray profiles of polycystic kidney disease and healthy uEVs showed differences in binding intensity of 6/43 lectins. Our results reveal a complex surface glycosylation profile of uEVs that is accessible to lectin-based analysis following multiple uEV enrichment techniques, is distinct from co-purified Tamm Horsfall protein and may demonstrate disease-specific modifications."

Twelve were extracellular matrix proteins, including the basement membrane proteins type IV collagen, nidogen-1, agrin and fibulin-1. Urine from chronic kidney disease patients contained a higher amount of exosomal protein and exosomal OPG than urine from healthy volunteers.

Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare autosomal recessive skin disease with severe skin inflammation and scaling, a specific hair shaft defect and constant allergic manifestations. NS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 (serine protease inhibitor of kazal type 5) encoding LEKTI-1 (lympho-epithelial kazal type related inhibitor type 5) expressed in stratified epithelia. In vitro and in vivo studies in murine models and in NS patients have cast light on the pathogenesis of the disease and shown that LEKTI deficiency results in unopposed kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) and KLK7 activities and to the overactivity of a new epidermal protease, elastase 2 (ELA2). Two main cascades initiated by KLK5 activity have emerged. One results in desmoglein 1 degradation and desmosome cleavage leading to stratum corneum detachment. KLK5 also activates KLK7 and ELA2, which contribute to a defective skin barrier. This facilitates allergen and microbe penetration and generates danger signals leading to caspase 1 activation and the production of active interleukin-1\u03b2. In parallel, KLK5 activates a specific cascade of allergy and inflammation by activating protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) receptors. PAR-2 activation triggers the production of the major pro-Th2 cytokine TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin) and several inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1. Levels of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) also contribute to allergy in a PAR-2-independent manner. Patient investigations have confirmed these abnormalities and revealed a wide spectrum of disease expression, sometimes associated with residual LEKTI expression. These results have demonstrated that the tight regulation of epidermal protease activity is essential for skin homeostasis and identified new targets for therapeutic intervention. They also provide a link with atopic dermatitis through deregulated protease activity, as recently supported by functional studies of the E420K LEKTI variant."

As stratum corneum (SC) lipids have a crucial role in the skin barrier function, we investigated the SC lipid composition and organization in NTS patients. We studied the SC lipid composition by means of mass spectrometry, and the lipid organization was examined by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Decreased free fatty acid (FFA) chain length and increased levels of monounsaturated FFAs were observed in the SC of NTS patients compared with controls. Furthermore, the level of short-chain ceramides (CERs) was enhanced in NTS patients and a strong reduction in long-chain CER levels was seen in several patients. The changes in lipid composition modified the lipid organization leading to an increased disordering of the lipids compared with the controls. In addition, in a subgroup of patients the organization of the lipid layers changed dramatically. The altered FFA and CER profiles in NTS patients corresponded to changes in the expression of enzymes involved in SC lipid processing. The observed changes in lipid composition, lipid organization, and enzyme expression are likely to contribute to the barrier dysfunction in NTS."

Lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) is the defective protein of the ichthyosiform condition Netherton syndrome (NS). Strongly expressed in the most differentiated epidermal layers, LEKTI is a serine protease inhibitor synthesized as three different high-molecular-weight precursors, which are rapidly processed into shorter fragments and secreted extracellularly. LEKTI polypeptides interact with several proteases to regulate skin barrier homeostasis as well as inflammatory and/or immunoallergic responses. Here, by combining antibody mapping, N-terminal sequencing, and site-specific mutagenesis, we defined the amino-acid sequence of most of the LEKTI polypeptides physiologically generated in human epidermis. We also identified three processing intermediates not described so far. Hence, a proteolytic cascade model for LEKTI activation is proposed. We then pinpointed the most effective fragments against the desquamation-related kallikreins (KLKs) and we proved that LEKTI is involved in stratum corneum shedding as some of its polypeptides inhibit the KLK-mediated proteolysis of desmoglein-1. Finally, we quantified the individual LEKTI fragments in the uppermost epidermis, showing that the ratios between LEKTI polypeptides and active KLK5 are compatible with a fine-tuned inhibition.

We have previously described efficient lentiviral vector-mediated gene transfer to keratinocyte stem cells and the generation of human skin grafts for the inherited skin disease, Netherton syndrome, which arises due to mutations in serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 (SPINK5). Vectors incorporating an internal murine retroviral-derived promoter [spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV)] in combination with a codon-optimized SPINK5 transgene supported high levels of reconstitution and robust correction of skin architecture. Subsequent longer-term experiments have uncovered unanticipated silencing phenomena, with loss of SPINK5 gene expression over time. The inadvertent introduction of CpG sites during codon optimization appears to have rendered vectors susceptible to silencing due to methylation across the promoter-transgene boundary. Substitution of the methylation-susceptible SFFV promoter with a 572-bp minimal human involucrin promoter (INVOp), which encodes very few CpG sites, prevented repression of the SPINK5 transgene and resulted in durable and highly compartment-specific reconstitution of lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) in human skin grafted onto immunodeficient mice.

Here we show that the membrane protease matriptase initiates Netherton syndrome in a LEKTI-deficient mouse model by premature activation of a pro-kallikrein cascade. Auto-activation of pro-inflammatory pro-kallikrein-related peptidases that are associated with stratum corneum detachment was either low or undetectable, but they were efficiently activated by matriptase. Ablation of matriptase from LEKTI-deficient mice dampened inflammation, eliminated aberrant protease activity, prevented detachment of the stratum corneum, and improved the barrier function of the epidermis. These results uncover a pathogenic matriptase-pro-kallikrein pathway that could operate in several human skin and inflammatory diseases."

NotchIC, together with the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind, form a ternary complex with CSL that activates transcription from genes that are responsive to Notch signaling. Illuminating the molecular details that underlie formation of the transcriptionally active CSL-NotchIC-Mastermind ternary complex is key for understanding how genes are turned on in response to a Notch signal. Recently, several studies using biophysical and computational methods have scrutinized how the CSL-NotchIC-Mastermind ternary complex forms and the role individual domains play in this process. These detailed analyses have provided a wealth of molecular insights into the assembly of a Notch pathway active transcription complex but have also raised several intriguing, yet confounding questions.

The Notch signalling pathway has a crucial function in determining cell fates in multiple tissues within metazoan organisms. On binding to ligands, the Notch receptor is cleaved proteolytically and releases its intracellular domain (NotchICD). The NotchICD enters the nucleus and acts cooperatively with other factors to stimulate the transcription of target genes. High levels of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation require the formation of a ternary complex consisting of NotchICD, CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless, LAG-1) and a Mastermind family member. However, it is still not clear how the formation of the ternary complex is regulated. Here we show that Nemo-like kinase (NLK) negatively regulates Notch-dependent transcriptional activation by decreasing the formation of this ternary complex. Using a biochemical screen, we identified Notch as a new substrate of NLK. NLK-phosphorylated Notch1ICD is impaired in its ability to form a transcriptionally active ternary complex. Furthermore, knockdown of NLK leads to hyperactivation of Notch signalling and consequently decreases neurogenesis in zebrafish. Our results both define a new function for NLK and reveal a previously unidentified mode of regulation in the Notch signalling pathway."

BACKGROUND Canonical Notch signaling is initiated when ligand binding induces proteolytic release of the intracellular part of Notch (ICN) from the cell membrane. ICN then travels into the nucleus where it drives the assembly of a transcriptional activation complex containing the DNA-binding transcription factor CSL, ICN, and a specialized co-activator of the Mastermind family. A consensus DNA binding site motif for the CSL protein was previously defined using selection-based methods, but whether subsequent association of Notch and Mastermind-like proteins affects the DNA binding preferences of CSL has not previously been examined. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here, we utilized protein-binding microarrays (PBMs) to compare the binding site preferences of isolated CSL with the preferred binding sites of CSL when bound to the CSL-binding domains of all four different human Notch receptors. Measurements were taken both in the absence and in the presence of Mastermind-like-1 (MAML1). Our data show no detectable difference in the DNA binding site preferences of CSL before and after loading of Notch and MAML1 proteins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These findings support the conclusion that accrual of Notch and MAML1 promote transcriptional activation without dramatically altering the preferred sites of DNA binding, and illustrate the potential of PBMs to analyze the binding site preferences of multiprotein-DNA complexes."

Ligand binding by Notch receptors triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages that liberate the intracellular portion of Notch (ICN) from the cell membrane, permitting it to translocate to the nucleus. Nuclear ICN binds to a highly conserved DNA-binding transcription factor called CSL (also known as RBP-Jkappa, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag-1) and recruits Mastermind-like transcriptional co-activators to form a transcriptional activation complex. Using bioinformatics tools, we identified a Rel homology region (RHR) within CSL that was used as a guide to determine the minimal protein requirements for ternary complex formation. The RHR of CSL contains both the N- and C-terminal beta-sheet domains (RHR-n and RHR-c) of typical Rel transcription factors, as judged by circular dichroism spectra. Binding of monomeric CSL to DNA requires the entire RHR of CSL and an additional 125-residue N-terminal sequence, whereas binding to ICN requires only the RHR-n domain. Although the RAM (RBP-Jkappa (recombination-signal-sequence-binding protein for Jkappa genes)-associated molecule) domain of ICN is flexible and relatively unstructured as an isolated polypeptide in solution, it associates stably with CSL on DNA. Recruitment of Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) to CSL.ICN complexes on DNA requires inclusion of the ankyrin repeat domain of ICN, and N- and C-terminal sequences of CSL extending beyond the DNA-binding region. The requirement for cooperative assembly of the MAML1.ICN.CSL.DNA complex suggests that a primary function of ICN is to render CSL competent for MAML loading.

In the developing central nervous system (CNS), Notch signaling preserves progenitor pools and inhibits neurogenesis and oligodendroglial differentiation. It has recently been postulated that Notch instructively drives astrocyte differentiation. Whether the role of Notch signaling in promoting astroglial differentiation is permissive or instructive has been debated. We report here that the astrogliogenic role of Notch is in part mediated by direct binding of the Notch intracellular domain to the CSL DNA binding protein, forming a transcriptional activation complex onto the astrocyte marker gene, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In addition, we found that, in CSL-/- neural stem cell cultures, astrocyte differentiation was delayed but continued at a normal rate once initiated, suggesting that CSL is involved in regulating the onset of astrogliogenesis. Importantly, although the classical CSL-dependent Notch signaling pathway is intact and able to activate the Notch canonical target promoter during the neurogenic phase, it is unable to activate the GFAP promoter during neurogenesis. Therefore, the effect of Notch signaling on target genes is influenced by cellular context in regulation of neurogenesis and gliogenesis."

Defects in orexin signalling are responsible for the human diseases of narcolepsy and cataplexy; inhibition of orexin receptors is an effective therapy for insomnia.

DATA SOURCES A PubMed search using the terms suvorexant and MK-4305 (the original name given to suvorexant during early trials) was conducted in December 2014 to identify initial literature sources. No time frame was used for exclusion of older trials. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Animal studies and trials written in a language other than English were excluded. Abstracts of the remaining trials were evaluated for determination of relevance to this review. References from these studies along with suvorexant prescriber information were used to identify additional literature. DATA SYNTHESIS Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were identified showing suvorexant to be safe, effective, and tolerable for the treatment of insomnia. After 4 weeks of therapy, relative to placebo, the 10- and 20-mg doses improved subjective total sleep time (22.3 and 49.9 minutes, respectively), wake after sleep onset (-21.4 and -28.1 minutes), and latency to persistent sleep (-2.3 and -22.3 minutes). CONCLUSION Suvorexant is the first dual orexin receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of insomnia. Clinical trials have shown that it is relatively safe and effective for the treatment of both sleep onset and sleep maintenance at doses of 20 mg or less. Higher doses were studied but not approved because of concerns for next-day somnolence and effects on driving. Further studies are needed to assess this medication in patients with a history of addiction, because they were excluded from clinical trials, as well as to compare suvorexant with other insomnia medications available because no head-to-head studies have yet been conducted. However, its novel mechanism of action and theoretically lower addiction liability make suvorexant an appealing new option."

Regardless, treatment of insomnia is beneficial to the patient and may benefit comorbidities if they exist. Nonpharmacologic modalities such as sleep hygiene and stimulus controls are important mainstays of insomnia therapy, but may not be sufficient to treat the disorder. Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) are a new class of insomnia medication that target wakefulness-promoting neuropeptides to regulate the sleep-wake cycle. Suvorexant is the first DORA to be approved and has demonstrated efficacy at decreasing both time to sleep onset and increasing total sleep time compared with placebo. Suvorexant has a novel mechanism of action and may represent an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate or do not receive benefit from traditional sleep agents. Suvorexant is generally effective and well tolerated, but has not been compared head to head with traditional sleep agents and being only newly available, lacks a longer-term 'real-world' experience base."

The organic cation transporter (OCT) 3 is widely expressed in various organs in humans, and involved in the disposition of many exogenous and endogenous compounds. Several lines of evidence have suggested that OCT3 expressed in the brain plays an important role in the regulation of neurotransmission. Relative to wild-type (WT) animals, Oct3 knockout (KO) mice have displayed altered behavioral and neurochemical responses to psychostimulants such as amphetamine (AMPH) and methamphetamine. In the present study, both in vitro and in vivo approaches were utilized to explore potential mechanisms underlying the disparate neuropharmacological effects observed following AMPH exposure in Oct3 KO mice. In vitro uptake studies conducted in OCT3 transfected cells indicated that dextroamphetamine (d-AMPH) is not a substrate of OCT3. However, OCT3 was determined to be a high-capacity and low-affinity transporter for the neurotransmitters dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT). Inhibition studies demonstrated that d-AMPH exerts relatively weak inhibitory effects on the OCT3-mediated uptake of DA, NE, 5-HT, and the model OCT3 substrate 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide. The IC(50) values were determined to be 41.5 +/- 7.5 and 24.1 +/- 7.0 microM for inhibiting DA and 5-HT uptake, respectively, while 50% inhibition of NE and 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide uptake was not achieved by even the highest concentration of d-AMPH applied (100 microM). Furthermore, the disposition of d-AMPH in various tissues including the brain, liver, heart, kidney, muscle, intestine, spleen, testis, uterus, and plasma were determined in both male and female Oct3 KO and WT mice. No significant difference was observed between either genotypes or sex in all tested organs and tissues. Our findings suggest that OCT3 is not a prominent factor influencing the disposition of d-AMPH. Additionally, based upon the inhibitory potency observed in vitro, d-AMPH is unlikely to inhibit the uptake of monoamines mediated by OCT3 in the brain. Differentiated neuropharmacological effects of AMPHs noted between Oct3 KO and WT mice appear to be due to the absence of Oct3 mediated uptake of neurotransmitters in the KO mice."

Mood disorders cause much suffering and are the single greatest cause of lost productivity worldwide. Although multiple medications, along with behavioral therapies, have proven effective for some individuals, millions of people lack an effective therapeutic option. A common serotonin (5-HT) transporter (5-HTT/SERT, SLC6A4) polymorphism is believed to confer lower 5-HTT expression in vivo and elevates risk for multiple mood disorders including anxiety, alcoholism, and major depression. Importantly, this variant is also associated with reduced responsiveness to selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. We hypothesized that a reduced antidepressant response in individuals with a constitutive reduction in 5-HTT expression could arise because of the compensatory expression of other genes that inactivate 5-HT in the brain. A functionally upregulated alternate transporter for 5-HT may prevent extracellular 5-HT from rising to levels sufficiently high enough to trigger the adaptive neurochemical events necessary for therapeutic benefit. Here we demonstrate that expression of the organic cation transporter type 3 (OCT3, SLC22A3), which also transports 5-HT, is upregulated in the brains of mice with constitutively reduced 5-HTT expression. Moreover, the OCT blocker decynium-22 diminishes 5-HT clearance and exerts antidepressant-like effects in these mice but not in WT animals. OCT3 may be an important transporter mediating serotonergic signaling when 5-HTT expression or function is compromised."

The organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3; synonymous: extraneuronal monoamine transporter, EMT, Slc22a3) encodes an isoform of the organic cation transporters and is expressed widely across the whole brain. OCTs are a family of high-capacity, bidirectional, multispecific transporters of organic cations. These also include serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine making OCTs attractive candidates for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety disorders. OCT3 has been implicated in termination of monoaminergic signalling in the central nervous system. Interestingly, OCT3 mRNA is however also significantly up-regulated in the hippocampus of serotonin transporter knockout mice where it might serve as an alternative reuptake mechanism for serotonin. The examination of the behavioural phenotype of OCT3 knockout mice thus is paramount to assess the role of OCT3. We have therefore subjected mice lacking the OCT3 gene to a comprehensive behavioural test battery. While cognitive functioning in the Morris water maze test and aggression levels measured with the resident-intruder paradigm were in the same range as the respective control animals, OCT3 knockout animals showed a tendency of increased activity and were significantly less anxious in the elevated plus-maze test and the open field test as compared to their respective wild-type controls arguing for a role of OCT3 in the regulation of fear and anxiety, probably by modulating the serotonergic tone in limbic circuitries."

Organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) is a high-capacity, low-affinity transporter that mediates bidirectional, sodium-independent transport of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, and histamine. OCT3-mediated transport is directly inhibited by corticosterone, suggesting a potential role for the transporter in mediating some of the effects of stress and glucocorticoids on monoaminergic neurotransmission. To elucidate the importance of OCT3 in clearance of extracellular monoamines in the brain, we used immunohistochemical techniques to describe the distribution of OCT3-like-immunoreactive (OCT3-ir) cells throughout the rostrocaudal extent of adult male rat brains. OCT3-ir cell bodies were widely distributed throughout the brain, with the highest densities observed in the superior and inferior colliculi, islands of Calleja, subiculum, lateral septum, lateral and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, and granule cell layers of the main and accessory olfactory bulbs, the cerebellum, and the retrosplenial granular cortex. OCT3-ir cells and/or fibers were also observed in circumventricular organs, and OCT3-ir ependymal cells were observed in the linings of all cerebral ventricles. The widespread distribution of OCT3-ir cell bodies, including regions receiving dense monoaminergic projections, suggests an important role for this transporter in regulating extracellular concentrations of monoamines in the rat brain and is consistent with the hypothesis that corticosterone-induced inhibition of OCT3-mediated transport may contribute to effects of acute stress or corticosterone on monoaminergic neurotransmission."

BACKGROUND Murine basophils can contribute to the T(H)2 polarization of the immune response by providing rapidly large amounts of IL-4, which suggests that pharmacologic downregulation of this cytokine might provide a strategy to attenuate pathologies associated with excessive production. OBJECTIVE We examined a number of physiological and pharmacologic ligands of the organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), a membrane carrier of biogenic amines, for their inhibitory effect on IL-4 production by basophils, selecting the most efficient compounds for in vivo evaluation in basophil-dependent experimental models. METHODS IL-4 production by basophils isolated ex vivo or from bone marrow cultures was assessed in response to various stimuli with or without biogenic monoamines or pharmacologic analogs. Selected compounds were administered in vivo to examine their effect on levels of circulating IgE generated during a basophil-dependent T(H)2 response and on basophil activation in mice receiving IL-33. RESULTS We found a drastic decrease in IL-4 production by stimulated basophils on exposure to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) that is taken up by basophils through the specific high-affinity transporters serotonin transporter and the polyspecific, high-capacity organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3; or Slc22a3) but inhibits their function exclusively through the latter. This downregulation is likewise observed in vivo in response to 5-HT and other OCT3 ligands, as well as in human basophils sorted from PMBCs of nonatopic donors. CONCLUSIONS We provide evidence for a new means of downregulating IL-4 production by basophils, both in vitro and in vivo, through OCT3 targeted by 5-HT and pharmacologic ligands."

Blockade of 5-HT3 receptors with granisetron reduced, whereas the 5-HT3 agonist phenylbiguanide increased, the frequency of mEPSCs. 5-HT decreased mEPSC frequency at low concentrations and increased frequency at high concentrations. This inhibition was blocked by the 5-HT1A antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635), which was ineffective on its own, whereas the excitation was reversed by granisetron. The addition of citalopram or D-22 caused inhibition, which was prevented by 5-HT1A blockade. Thus, in the NTS, the spontaneous release of 5-HT is able to activate 5-HT3 receptors, but not 5-HT1A receptors, as the release in their vicinity is removed by uptake. The ineffectiveness of corticosterone suggests that the low-affinity, high-capacity transporter is PMAT, not OCT3. For evoked 5-HT release, only D-22 caused an increase in the amplitude of EPSCs, with a decrease in the paired pulse ratio, and increased the number of spontaneous EPSCs after 20-Hz stimulation. Thus, for the evoked release of 5-HT, the low-affinity, high-capacity transporter PMAT, but not 5-HT transporter (5-HTT)/SERT, is important in the regulation of changes in 5-HT extracellular concentration."

Proven to be essential components in the CNS functions, OCT2 and OCT3 are suggested as potential targets of antidepressant therapeutics recently. Berberine, an active constituent derived from many medicinal plants, such as Coptis chinensis, has been reported to possess antidepressant-like action in the tail suspension test and forced swim test with elevated serotonin/norepinephrine/dopamine (5-HT/NE/DA) level in mouse brain; however the mechanism has not been elucidated. In consideration of the relation between OCT2/3 and antidepressant action, and the characteristic of berberine as an organic cation, we investigated the potential involvement of OCT2 and OCT3 in the antidepressant-like action of berberine in the present study. The results in mouse brain synaptosomes demonstrated that uptake-2 inhibition might play a notable role in enhanced serotonergic and noradrenergic effects induced by berberine. The inhibitory study in transfected MDCK cells displayed that berberine is a potent inhibitor of human OCT2 and OCT3, and its IC50 values for inhibition of transporter-mediated 5-HT/NE uptake are between 0.1 and 1\u03bcM. In addition, berberine was identified as a substrate of hOCT2 and hOCT3. In conclusion, berberine is a substrate and an inhibitor of hOCT2 and hOCT3, and its inhibition on OCT2- and OCT3-mediated 5-HT and NE uptake may contribute to the enhanced monoamine neurotransmission in mouse brain. It was deduced that the inhibition of OCT2 and OCT3 probably be implicated in the mechanism of antidepressant-like action."

Of particular interest is OCT3 expression and function in the brain, where it plays a role in serotonin clearance and influences mood and behavior. Protein kinase signaling mediates rapid modulation of cerebral processes, but little is known about acute regulation of OCT3 by protein kinases. Therefore, we cloned mouse OCT3 (mOCT3) and generated a human embryonic kidney cell line stably expressing the transporter to study transport characteristics, acute regulation by protein kinases, and interaction with psychotropic drugs. Uptake measurement was performed using the fluorescent cation 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP(+), 1 \u03bcM) as a substrate. The translational value of these findings was determined by comparing results obtained with cloned mouse and human OCT3. mOCT3-mediated transport is membrane potential dependent and pH independent. ASP(+) uptake by mOCT3 and human OCT3 (hOCT3) was efficiently inhibited by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, tetrapentylammonium (TPA(+)), corticosterone, serotonin, and histamine and by the drugs ketamine, fluoxetine, and diazepam. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations of mOCT3 and hOCT3 for TPA(+), serotonin, diazepam, and ketamine are significantly different. Diazepam is a non-transported inhibitor. Furthermore, the activities of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are acutely regulated by the p56 (lck) tyrosine kinase by decreasing their V max. Studies with freshly isolated renal proximal tubules from mOCT1/2(-/-) mice, in which mOCT3 is the only OCT present, confirmed this regulation pathway. Only the activity of hOCT3 is regulated by calmodulin. These findings suggest that even though many transport properties of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are similar, there are also species-specific aspects of OCT3 function."

OCT1 and OCT3, members of the potential-sensitive organic cation transporter gene family, physiologically transport a wide spectrum of organic cations. In addition, both transporters mediate low-affinity 5HT transport and, therefore, may participate in the clearance of excessive 5HT. Because concentrations of extracellular 5HT are increased in the brain of 5HTT-deficient mice, they are a model for investigating the role of OCTs in 5HT system homeostasis. Here, we analyzed OCT1 and OCT3 gene expression in the brain of 5HTT knockout mice by semiquantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. We demonstrate that, in 5HTT-deficient mice, OCT3 mRNA concentrations were significantly increased in the hippocampus, but not in other brain regions, including cortex, striatum, cerebellum, and brainstem. In contrast, no difference in OCT1 expression was detected between 5HTT knockout and control mice.

Recent studies suggest that CORT inhibits postsynaptic clearance of 5-HT from the extracellular fluid in the DMH by blocking organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), a polyspecific CORT-sensitive transport protein. Because OCTs are low-affinity, high-capacity transporters, we hypothesized that CORT effects on extracellular 5-HT are most pronounced in the presence of elevated 5-HT release. We predicted that local application of CORT into the DMH would potentiate the effects of d-fenfluramine, a 5-HT-releasing agent, on extracellular 5-HT. These experiments were conducted using in vivo microdialysis in freely-moving male Sprague-Dawley rats implanted with a microdialysis probe into the medial hypothalamus (MH), which includes the DMH. In Experiment 1, rats simultaneously received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 1 mg/kg D-fenfluramine or saline and either 200 ng/mL CORT or dilute ethanol (EtOH) vehicle delivered to the MH by reverse-dialysis for 40 min.

We find that apoptotic cells are remarkably motile, frequently migrating several cell diameters to the periphery of living tissues. F-actin remodeling occurs in surrounding cells, but also within the apoptotic cells themselves, suggesting a cell-autonomous component of motility.

Here we showed that ERM proteins associate directly with ELMO1 as purified recombinant proteins in vitro and at endogenous levels in intact cells. We mapped ERM binding on ELMO1 to the N-terminal 280 amino acids, which overlaps with the region required for binding to the GTPase RhoG, but is distinct from the C-terminal Dock180 binding region. Consistent with this, ELMO1 could simultaneously bind both radixin and Dock180, although radixin did not alter Rac activation via the Dock180-ELMO complex.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the function of ELMO1/DOCK180 in vascular development. METHODS AND RESULTS In situ hybridization studies for elmo1 identified a vascular and neuronal expression in zebrafish. Morpholino-based expression silencing of elmo1 severely impaired the formation of the vasculature, including intersomitic vessels, the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel, the parachordal vessel, and the development of the thoracic duct in tg(fli1:EGFP) embryos. Mechanistically, we identified Netrin-1 and its receptor Unc5B as upstream activators of the ELMO1/DOCK180 complex, regulating its functional interaction and leading to Rac1 activation in endothelial cells and vessel formation in zebrafish. CONCLUSIONS Our data have identified a novel signaling cascade regulating vasculature formation in zebrafish."

The importance of the SH3 domain of Hck in kinase regulation, substrate phosphorylation, and ligand binding has been established. However, few in vivo ligands are known for the SH3 domain of Hck. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to identify approximately 25 potential binding partners for the SH3 domain of Hck from the monocyte cell line U937. Two major interacting proteins were the actin binding proteins Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and WASP-interacting protein (WIP). We also focused on a novel interaction between Hck and ELMO1, an 84-kDa protein that was recently identified as the mammalian ortholog of the Caenorhabditis elegans gene, ced-12. In mammalian cells, ELMO1 interacts with Dock180 as a component of the CrkII/Dock180/Rac pathway responsible for phagocytosis and cell migration. Using purified proteins, we confirmed that WASP-interacting protein and ELMO1 interact directly with the SH3 domain of Hck. We also show that Hck and ELMO1 interact in intact cells and that ELMO1 is heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells that co-express Hck, suggesting that it is a substrate of Hck. The binding of ELMO1 to Hck is specifically dependent on the interaction of a polyproline motif with the SH3 domain of Hck. Our results suggest that these proteins may be novel activators/effectors of Hck."

In numerous cell systems, the small GTPase Rac is required for lamellipodia formation at the leading edge and movement ability. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to Rac activation during migration are still unclear. Recently, a mammalian superfamily of proteins related to the prototype member Dock180 has been identified with homologues in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we addressed the role of Dock180 and ELMO1 proteins, which function as a complex to mediate Rac activation, in mammalian cell migration. Using mutants of Dock180 and ELMO1 in a Transwell assay as well as transgenic rescue of a C. elegans mutant lacking CED-5 (Dock180 homologue), we identified specific regions of Dock180 and ELMO1 required for migration in vitro and in a whole animal model. In both systems, the Dock180.ELMO1 complex formation and the ability to activate Rac were required. We also found that ELMO1 regulated multiple Dock180 superfamily members to promote migration. Interestingly, deletion mutants of ELMO1 missing their first 531 or first 330 amino acids that can still bind and cooperate with Dock180 in Rac activation failed to promote migration, which correlated with the inability to localize to lamellipodia. This finding suggests that Rac activation by the ELMO.Dock180 complex at discrete intracellular locations mediated by the N-terminal 330 amino acids of ELMO1 rather than generalized Rac activation plays a role in cell migration."

Elmo1 and Elmo2 are highly homologous cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that interact with Dock family guanine nucleotide exchange factors to promote activation of the small GTPase Rac. In T lymphocytes, Dock2 is essential for CCR7- and CXCR4-dependent Rac activation and chemotaxis, but the role of Elmo proteins in regulating Dock2 function in primary T cells is not known. In this article, we show that endogenous Elmo1, but not Elmo2, interacts constitutively with Dock2 in mouse and human primary T cells. CD4(+) T cells from Elmo1(-/-) mice were profoundly impaired in polarization, Rac activation, and chemotaxis in response to CCR7 and CXCR4 stimulation. Transfection of full-length Elmo1, but not Elmo2 or a Dock2-binding mutant of Elmo1, rescued defective migration of Elmo1(-/-) T cells. Interestingly, Dock2 protein levels were reduced by 4-fold in Elmo1(-/-) lymphocytes despite normal levels of Dock2 mRNA. Dock2 polyubiquitination was increased in Elmo1(-/-) T cells, and treatment with proteasome inhibitors partially restored Dock2 levels in Elmo1(-/-) T cells. Finally, we show that Dock2 is directly ubiquitinated in CD4(+) T cells and that Elmo1 expression in heterologous cells inhibits ubiquitination of Dock2. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unknown, nonredundant role for Elmo1 in controlling Dock2 levels and Dock2-dependent T cell migration in primary lymphocytes. Inhibition of Dock2 has therapeutic potential as a means to control recruitment of pathogenic lymphocytes in diseased tissues. This work provides valuable insights into the molecular regulation of Dock2 by Elmo1 that can be used to design improved inhibitors that target the Elmo-Dock-Rac signaling complex."

The SH3 and SH2 domains of hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck) play important roles in substrate targeting. To identify new components of Hck signaling pathways, we identified proteins that bind to the SH3 domain of Hck (Scott et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 28238). One such protein was ELMO1, the mammalian orthologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans gene, ced-12. ELMO1 is an approximately 80-kD protein containing a PH domain and a C-terminal Pro-rich sequence. In C. elegans, ced-12 is required for the engulfment of dying cells and for cell migration. In mammalian fibroblasts, ELMO1 binds to Dock180, and functions upstream of Rac during phagocytosis and cell migration. We previously showed that ELMO1 binds directly to the Hck SH3 domain and is phosphorylated by Hck. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to identify the following sites of ELMO1 phosphorylation: Tyr 18, Tyr 216, Tyr 511, Tyr 395, and Tyr 720. Mutant forms of ELMO1 lacking these sites were defective in their ability to promote phagocytosis and migration in fibroblasts. Single tyrosine mutations showed that Tyr 511 is particularly important in mediating these biological effects. These mutants displayed comparable binding to Dock180 and Crk as wild-type ELMO1, but gave a lowered activation of Rac. The data suggest that Src family kinase mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ELMO1 might represent an important regulatory mechanism that controls signaling through the ELMO1/Crk/Dock180 pathway."

STUDY OBJECTIVE To compare four common dosing regimens for vancomycin in preterm and term neonates by assessing the probability that each regimen would achieve the widely used therapeutic target serum trough concentrations of 5-15 mg/L and the newly suggested target of 15-20 mg/L. DESIGN Retrospective population pharmacokinetic analysis using therapeutic drug monitoring data obtained from 1990-2007, with a subsequent simulation study performed on the pharmacokinetic model. SETTING Tertiary-care children's hospital. PATIENTS One hundred thirty-four preterm (66%) and term (34%) neonates, with a postnatal age of 1-121 days and postmenstrual age of 24.6-44 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Therapeutic drug monitoring data for vancomycin were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic model in the target population. Parameter estimates for the derived pharmacostatistical model were used to perform Monte Carlo simulations for four recommended dosing regimens: a standard dose for all neonates, postmenstrual age-based dosing, postmenstrual and postnatal age-based dosing, and serum creatinine-based dosing. Multivariate age-weight distributions were established for term and preterm neonates using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts and intrauterine and postnatal growth charts from the literature, respectively. Each dosing regimen was treated as a separate scenario in which 200 replicates with 100 patients/replicate were simulated. The 5-15-mg/L target trough serum concentration was achieved in 34% (90% confidence interval [CI] 20-53%), 42% (90% CI 31-55%), 52% (90% CI 43-60%), and 63% (90% CI 54-72%) of patients receiving the standard dose, postmenstrual age-based dose, postmenstrual and postnatal age-based dose, and serum creatinine-based dose, respectively. Serum creatinine-based dosing produced trough concentrations predominantly in the 5-15-mg/L target range, with the smallest variability in both term and preterm neonates. As expected, when the target range was narrow and higher (15-20 mg/L), only 13-21% of patients were within the range across the four dosing regimens. CONCLUSION Monte Carlo simulations based on our population pharmacokinetic model suggest that vancomycin dosing guidelines based on serum creatinine concentration have a greater likelihood of achieving trough concentrations in the 5-15-mg/L range compared with other evaluated dosing regimens. None of the four dosing regimens is suitable to produce target trough concentration of 15-20 mg/L in an acceptable number of patients."

A secondary objective was to correlate concomitant disease states and potentially nephrotoxic drug therapy with rises in serum creatinine in vancomycin recipients. METHODS Newborn infants with culture-proven Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococcal septicemia who received vancomycin therapy for >3 days between 1985 and 1995 were identified from an existing database and a review of medical record. All 69 patients included in the study had serial serum creatinine determinations, including a baseline value within 48 hours of starting treatment with vancomycin, and serum vancomycin concentrations determined after at least three doses, with peak and trough concentrations determined 1 hour after a 60-minute infusion and 15 to 30 minutes before a dose, respectively. Infants with congenital renal or cardiac anomalies were excluded. Demographic characteristics, vancomycin dosing regimen, serum vancomycin concentrations and sample times, concomitant drug therapy, and disease states were recorded. Patients were divided into group A (peak vancomycin concentration </=40 microg/mL) and group B (peak vancomycin concentration >40 microg/mL). The change in serum creatinine concentration between the start and end of vancomycin therapy was determined. Nephrotoxicity was identified if serum creatinine doubled at any time from the start to the end of vancomycin therapy. Alternative definitions of nephrotoxicity (any rise in serum creatinine to >0.6 mg/dL or new abnormalities of urine sediment) were used in additional analyses. RESULTS A total of 69 evaluable patients (gestational age, 28.9 +/- 3.0 weeks; birth weight, 1219 +/- 516 g) were identified, 61 in group A and 8 in group B. Six patients in group A underwent doubling of serum creatinine concentration during vancomycin therapy, whereas none in group B did so. Serum creatinine doubled to >0.6 mg/dL in only 3 infants (all in group A). Any increase in serum creatinine to >0.6 mg/dL was seen in 10 infants, 9 of whom were in group A. No confounding variable, including previous or concomitant underlying disease states associated with renal dysfunction or treatment with other potentially nephrotoxic agents, were associated with a significant rise in serum creatinine.

OBJECTIVE To compare hearing test results in infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) who were or were not treated with extended interval gentamicin dosing and/or standard vancomycin dosing.

BACKGROUND Recently the value of vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring, as well as the required therapeutic range, has been subject of debate, resulting in new recommendations. This study was performed to incorporate these new insights in an up-to-date dosing scheme for neonates of various gestational ages. METHODS In this retrospective study with prospective validation, 108 newborns with suspected central line-related septicemia during the first month of life received 30 mg/kg/day vancomycin divided into two doses regardless of gestational or postconceptional age. Trough and peak vancomycin serum concentrations were determined before and after the third dose. Vancomycin data were analyzed according to a one-compartment open model with use of NONMEM population pharmacokinetic software. Model parameters were evaluated and then used to simulate vancomycin dosing for different dose and dose interval combinations. Targets were a trough concentration between 5 and 15 mg/L and a peak below 40 mg/L. In the prospective study, the optimal scheme was tested in 22 patients. RESULTS Of the 108 patients, 34.3% of measured trough concentrations and 17.6% of peak concentrations were outside the desired therapeutic range. The model that best fitted the data included clearance and volume per kilogram and was independent of gestational age. Simulation of various dosing schemes showed that a dosing schedule of 30 mg/kg/day, irrespective of gestational age, in three doses was optimal, and this scheme was prospectively tested. Mean trough concentrations before the second dose were 8.2 +/- 2.2 mg/L versus a predicted trough of 8.9 +/- 2.5 mg/L. No peak levels higher than 40 mg/L were found. CONCLUSIONS The use of the proposed schedule leads to adequate vancomycin trough serum concentrations, and there is no need for routine monitoring of peak serum concentrations."

PURPOSE The therapeutic response of neonatal sepsis by Staphylococcus sp. treated with vancomycin was evaluated through serum concentrations of vancomycin, serum bactericidal titers (SBT), and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). METHOD Vancomycin serum concentrations were determined by the fluorescence polarization immunoassay technique, SBT by the macro-broth dilution method, and MIC by diffusion test in agar. RESULTS Thirteen newborn infants (59.1%) had adequate peak vancomycin serum concentrations (20 - 40 mg/mL) and one had peak concentration with potential ototoxicity risk (>40 microg/mL). Only 48% had adequate trough concentrations (5 - 10 mg/mL), and seven (28%) had a potential nephrotoxicity risk (>10 microg/mL). There was no significant agreement regarding normality for peak and trough vancomycin method (McNemar test : p = 0.7905). Peak serum vancomycin concentrations were compared with the clinical evaluation (good or bad clinical evolution) of the infants, with no significant difference found (U=51.5; p=0.1947). There was also no significant difference between the patients' trough concentrations and good or bad clinical evolution (U = 77.0; p=0.1710).

A bibliographic search was performed using PubMed and Embase, and articles with a publication date of August 2011 or earlier were included in the analysis. Vancomycin pharmacokinetic estimates, which are different in neonates compared with adults, also exhibit extensive inter-neonatal variability. In neonates, several vancomycin dosing schedules have been proposed, mainly based on age (i.e., postmenstrual and postnatal), body weight or serum creatinine level. Other covariates [e.g., extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), indomethacin or ibuprofen, and growth restriction] of vancomycin pharmacokinetics have been reported in neonates. Finally, vancomycin penetrates cerebrospinal fluid (range = 7-42%). Renal function drives vancomycin pharmacokinetics. Because either age or weight is the most relevant covariate of renal maturation, these covariates should be considered first in neonatal vancomycin dosing guidelines and further adjusted by renal dysfunction indicators (e.g., ECMO and ibuprofen/indomethacin). In addition to the prospective validation of available dosing guidelines, future studies should focus on the relevance of therapeutic drug monitoring and on the value of continuous vancomycin administration in neonates."

The teratogenicity of antiepilepsy drug valproic acid (VPA) mostly is found in genetic and somatic levels, causing teratogenesis involving neurotubular defects (NTDs), anencephaly, lumbosacral meningomyelocele, and leg dysfunction due to spina bifida aperta. A diversity of nutraceutics have been tried to alleviate the risk of VPA-teratogenicity. The effect was varying. In order to promote the preventive prescription, to find out its action mechanism can be rather crucial. We used chicken embryo model to try the effect of folic acid (FA), ascorbic acid (AA), and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). VPA at 30mM showed the higher malformation rate (66.7%) with the least mortality (22.2%). Pathological findings indicated that the cervical muscle was more susceptible to VPA injury than the ankle muscle. VPA downregulated levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), histone deacetylase (HDAC) and folate, and upregulated H(2)O(2) and homocysteine. FA, AA, and NAC significantly upregulated SOD, but only AA alone activated GSH. AA and NAC downregulated H(2)O(2), while FA was totally ineffective. All three nutraceutics comparably rescued HDAC with simultaneously suppressed homocysteine accumulation and folate re-elevation, although less effectively by NAC. Based on these data, we conclude VPA possesses \"Multiple Point Action Mechanism\". In addition to affecting the cited transcription and translation levels, we hypothesize that VPA competitively antagonize the glutamic acid to couple with pteroic acid in biosynthesis of dihydrofolic acid (DHFA). H(2)O(2) directly destroyed the NADPH reducing system at dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) levels, while completely restored by AA, an implication in preservation of intact apoenzymes. In addition, the GSH-GSSG system is sandwiched between the reducing systems NADPH/NADP and DHA-AA, its net balance is highly dependent on in situ in vivo Redox state, hence folic acid transformation is varying. To rescue the VPA-induced teratogenicity, simultaneous multiple prescriptions are suggested."

Failure of the neural tube to close during development results in exencephaly or anencephaly, as well as spina bifida. In mice, nonspecific activation of the maternal immune system can reduce fetal abnormalities caused by diverse etiologies, including diabetes-induced NTDs. We hypothesized that nonspecific activation of the maternal immune system with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) could reduce valproic acid (VA)-induced defects as well. Female CD-1 mice were given immune stimulant prebreeding: either IFN-gamma or GM-CSF. Approximately half of the control and immune-stimulated pregnant females were then exposed to 500 mg/kg VA on the morning of gestational day 8. The incidence of developmental defects was determined on gestational day 17 from at least eight litters in each of the following treatment groups: control, VA only, IFN-gamma only, IFN-gamma+VA, GM-CSF only, and GM-CSF+VA. The incidence of NTDs was 18% in fetuses exposed to VA alone, compared to 3.7% and 2.9% in fetuses exposed to IFN-gamma+VA, or GM-CSF+VA respectively. Ocular defects were also significantly reduced from 28.0% in VA exposed groups to 9.8% in IFN-gamma+VA and 12.5% in GM-CSF+VA groups.

PURPOSE To investigate pregnancy, delivery, and child outcome in an unselected population of women with both treated and untreated epilepsy. METHODS In the compulsory Medical Birth Registry of Norway, all 2,861 deliveries by women with epilepsy recorded from 1999-2005 were compared to all 369,267 nonepilepsy deliveries in the same period. RESULTS The majority (66%, n = 1900) in the epilepsy group did not use antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy. A total of 961 epilepsy-pregnancies were exposed to AEDs. Compared to nonepilepsy controls, AED-exposed infants were more often preterm (p = 0.01), and more often had birth weight <2,500 g (p < 0.001), head circumference <2.5 percentile (p < 0.001), and low Apgar score (p = 0.03). Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (<10 percentile) occurred more frequently in both AED-exposed (p = 0.05) and unexposed (p = 0.02) epilepsy-pregnancies. Frequency of major congenital malformations (MCMs) was 2.8% (n = 81) in the epilepsy group versus 2.5% in controls (p = 0.3). Increased risk for MCMs could be demonstrated only for exposure to valproate (5.6%, p = 0.005) and AED polytherapy (6.1%, p = 0.02). Neonatal spina bifida was not significantly increased, but was a major indication for elective pregnancy termination among women with epilepsy. Cesarean section was performed more often in maternal epilepsy, regardless of AED-exposure (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION Adverse pregnancy and birth outcome in women with epilepsy is mainly confined to AED-exposed pregnancies, although some risks are associated also with untreated epilepsy. The risk for congenital malformations was lower than previously reported. This could be due to a shift in AED selection, folic acid supplement, or possibly reflect the true risks in an unselected epilepsy population."

PURPOSE The study goal was to assess teratogenic effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) through the use of a surveillance system (MADRE) of infants with malformations. METHODS Information on all malformed infants (1990-1996) with maternal first-trimester drug exposure was collected by the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects and Monitoring Systems (ICBDMS). Cases were defined as infants presenting with a specific malformation, and controls were defined as infants presenting with any other birth defect. Exposure was defined by the use of AEDs during the first trimester of pregnancy. The association of AEDs with malformations was then estimated by calculating the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and testing their homogeneity among registries. RESULTS Among 8005 cases of malformations, 299 infants were exposed in utero to AEDs. Of those exposed to monotherapy, 65 were exposed to phenobarbital, 10 to methylphenobarbital, 80 to valproic acid, 46 to carbamazepine, 24 to phenytoin, and 16 to other AEDs. Associations were found for spina bifida with valproic acid. Infants exposed to phenobarbital and to methylphenobarbital showed an increased risk of oral clefts. Cardiac malformations were found to be associated with phenobarbital, methylphenobarbital, valproic acid, and carbamazepine. Hypospadias was associated with valproic acid. Porencephaly and other specified anomalies of brain, anomalies of face, coarctation of aorta, and limb reduction defects were found to be associated with valproic acid. CONCLUSIONS Using the MADRE system, we confirmed known teratogenic effects of AEDs. We also found increased risks for malformations that had never been reported associated with AEDs or for which the association was suggested by case reports."

We estimated distributions of the prevalence of valproic acid and carbamazepine use among women of childbearing age based on analyses of four data sets. We estimated the attributable fractions and the number of children born with each defect that could be prevented annually in the United States if valproic acid and carbamazepine were not used during pregnancy. The summary odds ratio estimate for the association between valproic acid and spina bifida was 11.9 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 4.0-21.2); for valproic acid and cleft palate 5.8 (95% UI: 3.3-9.5); for carbamazepine and spina bifida 3.6 (95% UI: 1.3-7.8); and for carbamazepine and cleft palate 2.4 (95% UI: 1.1-4.5) in the United States. Approximately 40 infants (95% UI: 10-100) with spina bifida and 35 infants (95% UI: 10-70) with cleft palate could be born without these defects each year if valproic acid were not used during pregnancy; 5 infants (95% UI: 0-15) with spina bifida and 5 infants (95% UI: 0-15) with cleft palate could be born without these defects each year if carbamazepine were not used during pregnancy.

Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) have painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs), which often reoccur across the individual's lifespan. Vaso-constrictive and vaso-dilatory molecules have been hypothesized to play a role in VOEs. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor that is released during VOEs and is correlated with pain history. Apelin is a vaso-dilatory peptide that also has a modulatory role in pain processing. We hypothesize that the ratio between vaso-dilatory and vaso-constrictive tone in children with SCD may be a marker of pain sensitization and vaso-occlusion. Plasma endothelin and apelin levels were measured in 47 children with SCD. Procedural pain and baseline pain were assessed via child- and caregiver-reports and observational distress. Pain history was assessed using retrospective chart review. Plasma apelin was related to age, with decreased levels in older children. The ratio between apelin and ET-1 was negatively correlated to observational baseline pain. The ratio between apelin and Big ET was negatively correlated to caregiver ratings of baseline pain and positively correlated to history of VOEs, which is possibly due to hydroxyurea treatment. These results suggest that an imbalance in the apelin and endothelin systems may contribute to an increasing number of VOEs and baseline pain in children with SCD."

An ip glucose tolerance test showed significantly impaired glucose clearance in APJ(\u0394islet) mice. APJ(\u0394islet) mice were not insulin resistant and in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was reduced modestly.

In the in vitro studies, we first demonstrated that the expression of apelin/APJ was upregulated in pericytes under hypoxia, and apelin increased pericytes proliferation and migration. Moreover, knockdown of apelin in pericyte was achieved via lentivirus-mediated RNA interference. After the inhibition of apelin, pericytes proliferation was inhibited significantly in hypoxia culture condition. Furthermore, exogenous recombinant apelin effectively prevented hypoxia-induced apoptosis through downregulating active-caspase 3 expression and increasing the ratio of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) in pericytes. These results suggest that apelin suppressed hypoxia-induced pericytes injury, which indicated that apelin could be a potential therapeutic target for retinal angiogenic diseases."

BACKGROUND C-terminal fragments of adipokine apelin are able to attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, but whether their effects are manifested during cardioplegic arrest remain obscure. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of natural apelin-12 (H-Arg-Pro-Arg-Leu-Ser-His-Lys-Gly-Pro-Met-Pro-Phe-OH, A12) and its novel structural analogs (H-(N(\u03b1)Me)Arg-Pro-Arg-Leu-Ser-His-Lys-Gly-Pro-Nle-Pro-Phe-OH, AI, and N(G)-Arg(N(G)NO2)-Pro-Arg-Leu-Ser-His-Lys-Gly-Pro-Nle-Pro-Phe-NH2, AII) as additives to crystalloid cardioplegia and explore benefits of early reperfusion with these peptides. METHODS Isolated working rat hearts subjected to normothermic global ischemia and further reperfusion were used. St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution No.2 (STH2) containing 140 \u03bcM A12, AI, or AII was infused for 5 min at 25 \u00b0C before ischemia. In separate series, peptide administration was used for 5 min after ischemia. Metabolic state of the hearts was evaluated by myocardial content of high energy phosphates and lactate. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was assessed in myocardial effluent on early reperfusion. RESULTS Addition of the peptides to STH2 enhanced functional and metabolic recovery of reperfused hearts compared with those of control (STH2 without additives). Cardioplegia with analog AII was the most effective and accompanied by a reduction of postischemic LDH leakage. Infusion of A12, AI, or AII after ischemia improved the majority indices of cardiac function and metabolic state of the heart by the end of reperfusion. However, the overall protective effect of the peptides was less than when they were added to STH2. CONCLUSIONS Enhancement of apelin bioavailability may minimize myocardial I/R damage during cardiac surgery. Structural analogs of A12 are promising components of clinical cardioplegic solutions."

Apelin and APJ have also been identified in the testis, hypothalamic nuclei such as arcuate, supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, implicating roles in the control of reproduction. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the effects of chronic central infusion of apelin-13 on LH, FSH and testosterone levels and testis morphology. 21 Wistar-Albino male rats received continuous intracerebroventricular infusion via Alzet osmotic mini pumps filled artificial cerebrospinal fluid (vehicle) or apelin-13 at concentrations of 1 or 10 nmol (10 \u03bcl/h) for seven days. At the last 90 min of the infusion period, the blood samples were collected at 15 min intervals (0-90 min) for LH and FSH analyses. At the last sampling point, the blood samples were analyzed for testosterone levels. Infusion of high dose apelin-13 significantly suppressed LH release compared with the vehicle values at 30, 60 and 75 min (p<0.05). However, FSH levels did not significantly differ among the groups. Serum testosterone levels in high dose apelin-13 group were statistically lower than the control group (p<0.05). In addition, histological examination showed that infusion of high dose apelin-13 significantly decreased the number of Leydig cells compared with the control and lower dose apelin-13 groups (p<0.05, p<0.01). Our results suggest that apelin-13 may play a role in the central regulation and decreases testosterone release by suppressing LH secretion. Thus, antagonists of the apelin receptor may, therefore, be useful for pharmaceuticals in the treatment of infertility."

BACKGROUND In vertebrates, poly(A) binding protein (PABP) is known to exist in five different isoforms. PABPs are primarily cytosolic with the exception of the nuclear PABP (PABPN1), which is located in the nucleus. Within the nucleus, PABPN1 is believed to bind to the poly(A) tail of nascent mRNA and along with cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) define the length of the newly synthesized poly(A) tail. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The cellular role of PABP1 has been extensively studied over the years; however, the function of other PABPs remains poorly defined. In order to understand the role of PABPN1 in cellular mRNA metabolism and it's interrelation with other PABPs, we depleted PABPN1 using RNAi in HeLa and HEK293 cells. Our results show that PABPN1 depletion did not have any effect on the poly(A) tail length, nuclear export of mRNA, mRNA translation, and transcription. Rather, PABPN1 depletion resulted in a compensatory response as observed by increased level of PABP5 and nuclear accumulation of PABP4. In addition, PABP4 was associated with the poly(A) tract of pre-mRNA and CPSF in PABPN1 depleted cells. Nevertheless, PABPN1 depletion significantly affected cell survival as evidenced by an increase in apoptosis markers: phosphorylated p53 and PUMA and as judged by the expression of ER stress marker GRP78. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that although function of PABPN1 may be compensated by nuclear translocation of PABP4 and perhaps by increase in the cytoplasmic abundance of PABP5, these were not sufficient to prevent apoptosis of cells. Thus PABPN1 may have a novel anti apoptotic role in mammalian cells."

Little is known about how these loci affect lipid levels in early life, but there is evidence that genetic effects on HDL- and LDL-cholesterol (HDL-C, LDL-C) and triglycerides vary with age. We studied Australian adults (N = 10,151) and adolescents (N = 2,363) who participated in twin and family studies and for whom we have lipid phenotypes and genotype information for 91 of the 95 genetic variants. Heterogeneity tests between effect sizes in adult and adolescent cohorts showed an excess of heterogeneity for HDL-C (p(Het)<0.05 at 5 out of 37 loci), but no more than expected by chance for LDL-C (1 out of 14 loci), or trigycerides (0 out 24).

Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However, UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation, we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model in which nuclear export of PABPs is dependent on ongoing mRNA export, and that a block in this process following UV exposure leads to accumulation of cytoplasmic PABPs in the nucleus. These data also provide mechanistic insight into reports that transcriptional inhibitors and expression of certain viral proteins cause relocation of PABP to the nucleus."

A northern blot of multiple human tissues hybridised with PABP3- and PABP1-specific oligonucleotide probes revealed two PABP3 mRNAs (2.1 and 2.5 kb) detected only in testis, whereas PABP1 mRNA (3.2 kb) was present in all tested tissues.

The human PABP3 gene is intronless with a transcription start site 61 nt upstream from the initiation codon. A sequence of 256 bp upstream from the transcription start site drives the promoter activity of PABP3 and its tissue-specific expression.

The high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncoproteins are critical to the immortalization of keratinocytes. HPV type 16 (HPV16) E6 interacts with endogenous proteins to activate hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, thus avoiding cellular senescence signals. NFX1-123, the longer splice variant of NFX1, interacts with HPV16 E6, as well as cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins 1 and 4 (PABPC1 and PABPC4). HPV16 E6 affects hTERT expression posttranscriptionally through NFX1-123, as NFX1-123 interacts with hTERT mRNA and stabilizes it, leading to greater telomerase activity. The PAM2 motif of NFX1-123, with which it binds PABPCs, is required for the posttranscriptional regulation of hTERT by HPV16 E6 and NFX1-123. There is increasing evidence that RNA and DNA viruses utilize RNA-processing proteins, and specifically PABPCs, in the normal virus life cycle, and there is also evidence that RNA-processing proteins are perturbed in cancers. Here, we show that PABPCs are critical in hTERT regulation by HPV16 E6. Although the amount and cellular localization of PABPCs were largely unchanged in cervical cancer cell lines with or without HPV16 and in human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) with or without HPV16 E6, knockdown of PABPCs decreased hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity and overexpression of PABPC4 increased these in HPV16 E6-expressing HFKs. In contrast, knockdown of PABPCs in C33A cells had no effect on hTERT mRNA or telomerase activity. Additionally, overexpression of PABPC4 and hTERT led to greater growth of cultured HPV16 E6-expressing HFKs. This is the first evidence that PABPCs have a targeted role in hTERT regulation leading to a growth advantage in cells expressing HPV16 E6."

METHODS Semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of 20 tissue samples including medullary breast carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma and non-cancerous tissues obtained from patients with fibrocystic disease (each of five) was performed using specifically generated polyclonal antibodies. Differences in expression patterns were evaluated considering percent of positively stained cells, insensitivity of staining and subcellular localization in cells of all tissue samples. RESULTS All 6 antigens predominantly expressed in the most cells of all histological types of breast tumors and non-cancerous tissues with slight differences in intensity of staining and subcellular localization. The most significant differences in expression pattern were revealed for RAD50 and LGALS3BP in different histological types of breast cancer and for PABPC4 and FAM50A antigens in immune cells infiltrating breast tumors.

Moreover, conditional knockout mice lacking Abl and Arg in T cells exhibit impaired CD8(+) T-cell expansion in vivo upon Listeria monocytogenes infection. Thus, Abl kinase signaling is required for both T-cell development and mature T-cell function."

Chromosomal rearrangements involving the ABL1 gene, leading to a BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, have been mainly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At present, six other genes have been shown to fuse to ABL1. The kinase domain of ABL1 is retained in all chimeric proteins that are also composed of the N-terminal part of the partner protein that often includes a coiled-coil or a helix-loop-helix domain. These latter domains allow oligomerization of the protein that is required for tyrosine kinase activation, cytoskeletal localization, and neoplastic transformation. Fusion genes that have a break in intron 1 or 2 (BCR-ABL1, ETV6-ABL1, ZMIZ1-ABL1, EML1-ABL1, and NUP214-ABL1) have transforming activity, although NUP214-ABL1 requires amplification to be efficient. The NUP214-ABL1 gene is the second most prevalent fusion gene involving ABL1 in malignant hemopathies, with a frequency of 5% in T-cell ALL. Both fusion genes (SFPQ-ABL1 and RCSD1-ABL1) characterized by a break in intron 4 of ABL1 are associated with B-cell ALL, as the chimeric proteins lacked the SH2 domain of ABL1. Screening for ABL1 chimeric genes could be performed in patients with ALL, more particularly in those with T-cell ALL because ABL1 modulates T-cell development and plays a role in cytoskeletal remodeling processes in T cells."

The ABL1 proto-oncogene encodes a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) that has been implicated in processes of cell differentiation, cell division, cell adhesion and stress response. Alterations of ABL1 by chromosomal rearrangement or viral transduction can lead to malignant transformation. Activity of the c-Abl protein is negatively regulated by its SH3 domain through an unknown mechanism, and deletion of the SH3 domain turns ABL1 into an oncogene. We present evidence for an intramolecular inhibitory interaction of the SH3 domain with the catalytic domain and with the linker between the SH2 and catalytic domain (SH2-CD linker). Site-directed mutations in each of these three elements activate c-Abl. Mutations in the linker cause a conformational change of the molecule and increase binding of the SH3 domain to peptide ligands. Individual mutation of two charged residues in the SH3 and catalytic domain activates c-Abl, while inhibition is restored in the double reciprocal mutant. We propose that regulators of c-Abl will have opposite effects on its activity depending on their ability to favour or disrupt these intramolecular interactions."

Specific abnormalities are correlated with clinical phenotype, although some are broad and encompass several World Health Organization-defined entities. TKs are excellent drug targets as exemplified by the activity of imatinib in BCR-ABL1-positive disease, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia.

ABL family tyrosine kinases are tightly regulated by autoinhibition and phosphorylation mechanisms. These kinases maintain an inactive conformation through intramolecular interactions involving SH3 and SH2 domains. RIN1, a downstream effector of RAS, binds to the ABL SH3 and SH2 domains and stimulates ABL tyrosine kinase activity. RIN1 binding to the ABL2 kinase resulted in a large decrease in Km and a small increase in Vmax toward an ABL consensus substrate peptide. The enzyme efficiency (k(cat)/Km) was increased more than 5-fold by RIN1. In addition, RIN1 strongly enhanced ABL-mediated phosphorylation of CRK, PSTPIP1, and DOK1, all established ABL substrates but with unique protein structures and distinct target sequences. Importantly RIN1-mediated stimulation of ABL kinase activity was independent of activation by SRC-mediated phosphorylation. RIN1 increased the kinase activity of both ABL1 and ABL2, and this occurred in the presence or absence of ABL regulatory domains outside the SH3-SH2-tyrosine kinase domain core. We further demonstrate that a catalytic site mutation associated with broad drug resistance, ABL1T315I, remains responsive to stimulation by RIN1. These findings are consistent with an allosteric kinase activation mechanism by which RIN1 binding promotes a more accessible ABL catalytic site through relief of autoinhibition. Direct disruption of RIN1 binding may therefore be a useful strategy to suppress the activity of normal and oncogenic ABL, including inhibitor-resistant mutants that confound current therapeutic strategies.

To understand the mechanism by which p105 binds and inhibits NF-kappaB, we have used both p105 and its C-terminal inhibitory segment known as IkappaBgamma for our study. We show here that one IkappaBgamma molecule binds to NF-kappaB dimers wherein at least one NF-kappaB subunit is p50. We suggest that the obligatory p50 subunit in IkappaBgamma.NF-kappaB complexes is equivalent to the N-terminal p50 segment in all p105.NF-kappaB complexes. The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the obligatory p50 subunit is masked by IkappaBgamma, whereas the NLS of the nonobligatory NF-kappaB subunit is exposed. Thus, the global binding mode of all IkappaB.NF-kappaB complexes seems to be similar where one obligatory (or specific) NF-kappaB subunit makes intimate contact with IkappaB and the nonobligatory (or nonspecific) subunit is bound primarily through its ability to dimerize. In the case of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta, the specific NF-kappaB subunit in the complex is p65. In contrast to IkappaBalpha.NF-kappaB complexes, where the exposed NLS of the nonspecific subunit imports the complex to the nucleus, p105.NF-kappaB and IkappaBgamma.NF-kappaB complexes are cytoplasmic. We show that the death domain of p105 (also of IkappaBgamma) is essential for the cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-kappaB by p105 and IkappaBgamma. However, the death domain does not mask the exposed NLS of the complex. We also demonstrate that the death domain alone is not sufficient for cytoplasmic retention and instead functions only in conjunction with other parts in the three-dimensional scaffold formed by the association of the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) and NF-kappaB dimer. We speculate that additional cytoplasmic protein(s) may sequester the entire p105.NF-kappaB complex by binding through the death domain and other segments, including the exposed NLS."

This newly synthesized IkappaBalpha also translocates to the nucleus, removes activated NF-kappaB from its target genes, and brings it back to the cytoplasm to terminate the phase of NF-kappaB activation. We show here that IkappaBalpha enhances the transactivation potential of several homeodomain-containing proteins such as HOXB7 and Pit-1 through a NF-kappaB-independent association with histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and HDAC3 but not with HDAC2, -4, -5, and -6. IkappaBalpha bound both HDAC proteins through its ankyrin repeats, and this interaction was disrupted by p65. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated further that IkappaBalpha acts by partially redirecting HDAC3 to the cytoplasm. At the same time, an IkappaBalpha mutant, which lacked a functional nuclear localization sequence, interacted very efficiently with HDAC1 and -3 and intensively enhanced the transactivation potential of Pit-1. Our results support the hypothesis that the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha regulates the transcriptional activity of homeodomain-containing proteins positively through cytoplasmic sequestration of HDAC1 and HDAC3, a mechanism that would assign a new and unexpected role to IkappaBalpha."

IkappaBalpha gene expression is also regulated by an NF-kappaB autoregulatory mechanism, via NF-kappaB binding sites in the IkappaBalpha promoter. In previous studies, tetracycline-inducible expression of transdominant repressors of IkappaBalpha (TD-IkappaBalpha) progressively decreased endogenous IkappaBalpha protein levels. In the present study, we demonstrate that expression of TD-IkappaBalpha blocked phorbol myristate acetate-phytohemagglutinin or tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced IkappaBalpha gene transcription and abolished NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, due to the continued cytoplasmic sequestration of RelA(p65) by TD-IkappaBalpha. In vivo genomic footprinting revealed stimulus-responsive protein-DNA binding not only to the -63 to -53 kappaB1 site but also to the adjacent -44 to -36 Sp1 site of the IkappaBalpha promoter.

IkappaB alpha can also act in the nucleus as a postinduction repressor of NF-kappaB/Rel proteins. The mechanism by which IkappaB alpha enters the nucleus is not known, as IkappaB alpha lacks a discernible classical nuclear localization sequence (NLS).

Deletion of the second ankyrin repeat or alanine substitution of hydrophobic residues within the second ankyrin repeat disrupts nuclear localization of IkappaB alpha. Furthermore, a region encompassing the second ankyrin repeat of IkappaB alpha is able to function as a discrete nuclear import sequence. The presence of a discrete nuclear import sequence in IkappaB alpha suggests that cytoplasmic sequestration of the NF-kappaB/Rel-IkappaB alpha complex is a consequence of the mutual masking of the NLS within NF-kappaB/Rel proteins and the import sequence within IkappaB alpha. Nuclear import may be a conserved property of ankyrin repeat domains (ARDs), as the ARDs from two other ARD-containing proteins, 53BP2 and GABPbeta, are also able to function as nuclear import sequences.

The generalized exocrinopathy cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common severe genetic disease in Caucasian populations. A panel of more than 700 chromosomes from German and Turkish CF patients was screened for disease-causing mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene by chemical cleavage of mismatch, single strand conformation polymorphism, restriction analysis and direct sequencing of genomic DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Besides the major 3-bp deletion, delta F508 that was found on 73% of German CF chromosomes, more than 50 other missense, nonsense, frame-shift, and splice-site mutations have already been identified. In general, a CFTR mutation is linked with a single 10-marker haplotype which indicates that in most cases a particular mutation spread from a common ancestor. The comparison of mutation genotypes with the disease phenotype emphasized the causative role of the type and localization of the CFTR mutation for clinical course and prognosis. Pancreatic status and the risk of colonization of airways with opportunistic pathogens are genetically determined. Most patients who are harbouring mutations in the nucleotide binding folds were suffering from severe CF disease. Mild or even aberrant forms of CF were observed for many missense mutations located in the putative transmembrane domains or for mutations that are expected to result in a truncated protein of half of wild-type CFTR."

To determine the nature and frequency of non-delta F508 cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations among diverse populations, we have sequenced exons 9-12 and 19-23 of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene from 128 CF chromosomes (39 U.S. Caucasian, 27 African-American, 42 Northern Irish, and 20 Israeli chromosomes). These regions were chosen because they encode the two putative ATP-binding folds of CFTR, domains which appear to have functional significance. In addition, CFTR exons 1 and 2 were analyzed in the American patients. Mutations were found on 49 of the 128 CF chromosomes. Nineteen different mutations were observed; six were novel, while the remaining 13 had been reported previously by our group or by other investigators. Six of nine different mutations found in African-American patients were unique to that population. However, the vast majority of the mutations found in U.S. Caucasians (eight of nine), Northern Irish (four of five), and Israelis (three of three) also occurred in other Caucasian groups. The preponderance of previously reported mutations in these three groups suggested that a subset of the non-delta F508 mutations occur in common among Caucasians. A survey of mutation frequencies in other Caucasian groups confirmed this observation. Unfortunately, this subset accounts for less than half of non-delta F508 CF mutations in most groups. These data suggest that screening for delta F508 and this select group of mutations will efficiently and economically maximize the number of CF mutations identified in Caucasian groups. However, it will be difficult to detect more than 90% of mutant CFTR alleles except in ethnically and geographically discrete populations where CF is the result of founder effect."

BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disorder in Caucasian populations, with over 1400 mutations identified in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. Mutations in the CFTR gene may be also causative for CBAVD (Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens). The type and distribution of mutations varies widely between different countries and/or ethnic groups, and is relatively unknown in Iran. We therefore performed a comprehensive analysis of the CFTR gene in Iranian CF patients. METHODS 69 Iranian CF patients, and 1 CBAVD patient, were analysed for mutations in the complete coding region, and its exon/intron junctions, of their CFTR genes, using different methods, such as ARMS (amplification refractory mutation system)-PCR, SSCP (single stranded conformation polymorphism) analysis, restriction enzyme digestion analysis, direct sequencing, and MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-mediated Probe Amplification). RESULTS CFTR mutation analysis revealed the identification of 37 mutations in 69 Iranian CF patients. Overall, 81.9% (113/138) CFTR genes derived from Iranian CF patients could be characterized for a disease-causing mutation. The CBAVD patient was found to be homozygous for the p.W1145R mutation. The most common mutations were p.F508del (DeltaF508) (18.1%), c.2183_2184delAAinsG (2183AA>G) (6.5%), p.S466X (5.8%), p.N1303K (4.3%), c.2789+5G>A (4.3%), p.G542X (3.6%), c.3120+1G>A (3.6%), p.R334W (2.9%) and c.3130delA (2.9%). These 9 types of mutant CFTR genes totaled for 52% of all CFTR genes derived from the 69 Iranian CF patients. Eight mutations, c.406-8T>C, p.A566D, c.2576delA, c.2752-1_2756delGGTGGCinsTTG, p.T1036I, p.W1145R, c.3850-24G>A, c.1342-?_1524+?del, were found for the first time in this study. CONCLUSIONS We identified 37 CFTR mutations in 69 well characterized Iranian CF patients, obtaining a CFTR mutation detection rate of 81.9%, the highest detection rate obtained in the Iranian population so far. These findings will assist in genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis and future screening of CF in Iran."

The encoded gene product, named cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), corresponds to a cAMP-regulated chloride channel found almost exclusively in the secretory epithelial cells. Although the major mutation that results in a single amino acid deletion (F508) accounts for 70% of the disease alleles, more than 550 additional mutant alleles of different forms have been detected. Many of these mutations can be divided into five general classes in terms of their demonstrated or presumed molecular consequences. In addition, a good correlation has been found between CFTR genotype and one of the clinical variables--pancreatic function status. An unexpected finding, however, is the documentation of CFTR mutations in patients with atypical CF disease presentations, including congenital absence of vas deferens and several pulmonary diseases. Thus, the implication of CFTR mutation is more profound than CF alone."

BACKGROUND Cigarette smoking causes Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the 3rd leading cause of death in the U.S. CFTR ion transport dysfunction has been implicated in COPD pathogenesis, and is associated with chronic bronchitis. However, susceptibility to smoke induced lung injury is variable and the underlying genetic contributors remain unclear. We hypothesized that presence of CFTR mutation heterozygosity may alter susceptibility to cigarette smoke induced CFTR dysfunction. Consequently, COPD patients with chronic bronchitis may have a higher rate of CFTR mutations compared to the general population. METHODS Primary human bronchial epithelial cells derived from F508del CFTR heterozygotes and mice with (CFTR+/-) and without (CFTR+/+) CFTR heterozygosity were exposed to whole cigarette smoke (WCS); CFTR-dependent ion transport was assessed by Ussing chamber electrophysiology and nasal potential difference measurements, respectively. Caucasians with COPD and chronic bronchitis, age 40 to 80 with FEV1/FVC < 0.70 and FEV1 < 60% predicted, were selected for genetic analysis from participants in the NIH COPD Clinical Research Network's Azithromycin for Prevention of Exacerbations of COPD in comparison to 32,900 Caucasian women who underwent prenatal genetic testing. Genetic analysis involved an allele-specific genotyping of 89 CFTR mutations. RESULTS Exposure to WCS caused a pronounced reduction in CFTR activity in both CFTR (+/+) cells and F508del CFTR (+/-) cells; however, neither the degree of decrement (44.7% wild-type vs. 53.5% F508del heterozygous, P = NS) nor the residual CFTR activity were altered by CFTR heterozygosity. Similarly, WCS caused a marked reduction in CFTR activity measured by NPD in both wild type and CFTR heterozygous mice, but the severity of decrement (91.1% wild type vs. 47.7% CF heterozygous, P = NS) and the residual activity were not significantly affected by CFTR genetic status. Five of 127 (3.9%) COPD patients with chronic bronchitis were heterozygous for CFTR mutations which was not significantly different from controls (4.5%) (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS The magnitude of WCS induced reductions in CFTR activity was not affected by the presence of CFTR mutation heterozygosity. CFTR mutations do not increase the risk of COPD with chronic bronchitis. CFTR dysfunction due to smoking is primarily an acquired phenomenon and is not affected by the presence of congenital CFTR mutations."

Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited lethal disease in Caucasians. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), of which the cftr \u0394F508 mutation is the most common. \u0394F508 macrophages are intrinsically defective in autophagy because of the sequestration of essential autophagy molecules within unprocessed CFTR aggregates. Defective autophagy allows Burkholderia cenocepacia (B. cepacia) to survive and replicate in \u0394F508 macrophages. Infection by B. cepacia poses a great risk to cystic fibrosis patients because it causes accelerated lung inflammation and, in some cases, a lethal necrotizing pneumonia. Autophagy is a cell survival mechanism whereby an autophagosome engulfs non-functional organelles and delivers them to the lysosome for degradation. The ubiquitin binding adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62 is required for the delivery of several ubiquitinated cargos to the autophagosome. In WT macrophages, p62 depletion and overexpression lead to increased and decreased bacterial intracellular survival, respectively. In contrast, depletion of p62 in \u0394F508 macrophages results in decreased bacterial survival, whereas overexpression of p62 leads to increased B. cepacia intracellular growth. Interestingly, the depletion of p62 from \u0394F508 macrophages results in the release of the autophagy molecule beclin1 (BECN1) from the mutant CFTR aggregates and allows its redistribution and recruitment to the B. cepacia vacuole, mediating the acquisition of the autophagy marker LC3 and bacterial clearance via autophagy. These data demonstrate that p62 differentially dictates the fate of B. cepacia infection in WT and \u0394F508 macrophages."

BACKGROUND Numerous studies have reported CFTR mutations in CBAVD (congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens) patients, but their results are not completely consistent. Here, we present a systemic review and meta-analysis with emphasis on clarifying further the genetic association of CFTR mutations with CBAVD. METHODS We searched the MEDLINE database until March, 2011 for eligible articles reporting CFTR mutations in CBAVD. Relevant data from each included study were abstracted by two independent reviewers. The overall frequency of CFTR mutations in CBAVD and the odds ratio (OR) for common specific alleles were pooled under random-effect or fixed-effect model as appropriate. Subgroup analysis was performed by ethnicity, and potential heterogeneity and bias were both assessed. RESULTS Among CBAVD patients, 78% had at least one CFTR mutation, 46% having two and 28% only one. Moreover, the common heterozygous F508del/5T and F508del/R117H were observed in 17 and 4% of CBAVD cases respectively, and the allele frequency in CBAVD was 17% for F508del, 25% for 5T and 3% for R117H. Subgroup analysis indicated an increased frequency of cases with two mutations in Caucasian patients than in Non-Caucasian (68 versus 50%, P= 0.012), but no differences for cases with at least one mutation (88 versus 77%, P= 0.163) or with only one mutation (17 versus 25%, P= 0.115). Caucasian patients had higher F508del frequency, but lower 5T frequency, than Non-Caucasian (22 versus 8%, P= 0.001; 20 versus 31%, P= 0.009). Summary OR was 9.25 for 5T [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.07-12.11, P= 0.000], with moderate heterogeneity (I(2)= 49.20%, P= 0.019) and evident bias (Egger's test, P= 0.005), and it was 19.43 for 5T/(TG)12_13 (95% CI 10.48-30.03, P= 0.000) without any evidence of heterogeneity (I(2)= 0.1%, P= 0.391) and bias (Egger's test, P= 0.160). The OR for 5T/(TG)12_13 was significantly higher than that for 5T allele (P= 0.000). CONCLUSIONS In summary, our results demonstrate a high frequency of CFTR mutations in CBAVD patients, and these exhibit evident ethnic differences. In addition, 5T allele and 5T/(TG)12_13 may contribute to the increased risk for CBAVD, with the 5T penetrance probably being modulated by adjacent (TG)12_13."

Data were analysed from the patient biographies held in the UK CF Database (see www.cystic-fibrosis.org.uk). The currently registered population of 5,274 CF patients is 96.3% Caucasian with a male preponderance that significantly increases with age. The majority of the 196 non-Caucasian CF patients are from the Indian Subcontinent (ISC), of which one in 84 UK CF patients are of Pakistani origin. The commonest CFTR mutation, deltaF508, is found in 74.1% of all CF chromosomes. In the Caucasian CF population, 57.5% are deltaF508 homozygotes but the UK ISC CF population with only 24.7%, has significantly fewer deltaF508 homozygotes patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.4). The distribution of Caucasian patients with deltaF508/deltaF508, deltaF508/Other and Other/Other does not fit the expected distribution with a Hardy-Weinberg model unless those patients without a detected mutation are excluded (P<0.001). The UK CF Database has shown the UK CF population to have distinct characteristics separate from the North American and European CF Registries. The ISC group contains many mutations not recognised by current genetic analysis, and one in four ISC patients have no CFTR mutations identified. The CFTR analysis proposed for the screening programme would detect 96% of patients registered in the database, but is unlikely to achieve the desired >80% detection rates in the ethnic minority groups.

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a major role in host defense against microbial infections in the lung. To perform this function, these cells must ingest and destroy pathogens, generally in phagosomes, as well as secrete a number of products that signal other immune cells to respond. Recently, we demonstrated that murine alveolar macrophages employ the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel as a determinant in lysosomal acidification (Di, A., Brown, M. E., Deriy, L. V., Li, C., Szeto, F. L., Chen, Y., Huang, P., Tong, J., Naren, A. P., Bindokas, V., Palfrey, H. C., and Nelson, D. J. (2006) Nat. Cell Biol. 8, 933-944). Lysosomes and phagosomes in murine cftr(-/-) AMs failed to acidify, and the cells were deficient in bacterial killing compared with wild type controls. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in CFTR and is characterized by chronic lung infections. The information about relationships between the CFTR genotype and the disease phenotype is scarce both on the organismal and cellular level. The most common disease-causing mutation, DeltaF508, is found in 70% of patients with cystic fibrosis. The mutant protein fails to fold properly and is targeted for proteosomal degradation. G551D, the second most common mutation, causes loss of function of the protein at the plasma membrane. In this study, we have investigated the impact of CFTR DeltaF508 and G551D on a set of core intracellular functions, including organellar acidification, granule secretion, and microbicidal activity in the AM. Utilizing primary AMs from wild type, cftr(-/-), as well as mutant mice, we show a tight correlation between CFTR genotype and levels of lysosomal acidification, bacterial killing, and agonist-induced secretory responses, all of which would be expected to contribute to a significant impact on microbial clearance in the lung."

During embryogenesis there is a major switch from dependence upon maternally-deposited products to reliance on products of the zygotic genome. In animals, this so-called maternal-to-zygotic transition occurs following a period of transcriptional quiescence. Recently, we have shown that the early embryo in Arabidopsis is also quiescent, a state inherited from the female gamete and linked to specific patterns of H3K9 dimethylation and TERMINAL FLOWER2 (TFL2) localization. We also demonstrated that CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) is required for H3K9 dimethylation in the egg cell and for normal embryogenesis during the first few divisions of the zygote. Subsequent analysis of CMT3 mutants points to a key role in egg cell reprogramming by controlling silencing in both transposon and euchromatic regions. A speculative model of the CMT3-induced egg cell silencing is presented here, based on these results and current data from the literature suggesting the potential involvement of small RNAs targeted to the egg cell, a process conceptually similar to the division of labor described in the male gametophyte for which we show that H3K9 modifications and TFL2 localization are reminiscent of the female gametophyte."

Gene expression microarrays were hybridized with RNA samples from the inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and from near-isogenic derivatives containing the loss-of-function allele zmet2-m1. A set of 126 genes that displayed statistically significant differential expression in zmet2 mutants relative to wild-type plants in at least one of the two genetic backgrounds was identified. Analysis of the transcript levels in both wild-type and mutant individuals revealed that only 10% of these genes were affected in zmet2 mutants in both B73 and Mo17 genetic backgrounds. Over 80% of the genes with expression patterns affected by zmet2 mutations display variation for gene expression between wild-type B73 and Mo17 plants. Further analysis was performed for 7 genes that were transcriptionally silent in wild-type B73, but expressed in B73 zmet2-m1, wild-type Mo17, and Mo17 zmet2-m1 lines. Mapping experiments confirmed that the expression differences in wild-type B73 relative to Mo17 inbreds for these genes were caused by cis-acting regulatory variation. Methylation-sensitive PCR and bisulfite sequencing demonstrated that for 5 of these genes the CpNpG methylation in the wild-type B73 genetic background was substantially decreased in the B73 zmet2-m1 mutant and in wild-type Mo17. A survey of eight maize inbreds reveals that each of these 5 genes exhibit transcriptionally silent and methylated states in some inbred lines and unmethylated, expressed states in other inbreds, providing evidence for natural variation in epigenetic states for some maize genes."

By data mining in the sequence of the Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 genome, six putative mycolyltransferase genes were identified that code for proteins with similarity to the N-terminal domain of the mycolic acid transferase PS1 of the related C. glutamicum strain ATCC 17965. The genes identified were designated cop1, cmt1, cmt2, cmt3, cmt4, and cmt5 ( cmt from corynebacterium mycolyl transferases). cop1 encodes a protein of 657 amino acids, which is larger than the proteins encoded by the cmt genes with 365, 341, 483, 483, and 411 amino acids. Using bioinformatics tools, it was shown that all six gene products are equipped with signal peptides and esterase domains. Proteome analyses of the cell envelope of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 resulted in identification of the proteins Cop1, Cmt1, Cmt2, and Cmt4. All six mycolyltransferase genes were used for mutational analysis. cmt4 could not be mutated and is considered to be essential. cop1 was found to play an additional role in cell shape formation. A triple mutant carrying mutations in cop1, cmt1, and cmt2 aggregated when cultivated in MM1 liquid medium. This mutant was also no longer able to synthesize trehalose di coryno mycolate (TDCM). Since single and double mutants of the genes cop1, cmt1, and cmt2 could form TDCM, it is concluded that the three genes, cop1, cmt1, and cmt2, are involved in TDCM biosynthesis.

The 791 residue \"chromomethylase\" (CMT1) is encoded by a floral transcript that is spliced from 20 exons and is present at only approximately 1/10(-7) of total mRNA. Genomic sequencing reveals an ancient haplotype split at CMT1 between Col-0 + Metz and the other ecotypes examined. In the Col-0 + Metz haplotype, alternative mRNA processing at intron 13 truncates the coding region. In Ler, RLD, and No-0, similar truncation is caused by insertion of an intact retrotransposon, Evelknievel, which is present as a single copy in Ler and RLD and is currently methylated and inactive. Evelknievel is found at this site on a single branch that connects the Ler, RLD, and No-0 ecotypes but is absent from the genomes of all other ecotypes examined. A stop codon within exon 6 of the Metz ecotype confirms that CMT1 is nonessential. Nevertheless, comparison to CMT1 of Cardaminopsis arenosa, an outcrossing relative, indicates conservation for DNA methyltransferase function. We discuss how allelic diversity of CMT1 may reflect loosened selective constraints in a self-fertilizing species such as Arabidopsis thaliana."

Tomato fruit cells are characterized by a strong increase in nuclear ploidy during fruit development. Average ploidy levels increased to similar levels (above 50C) in two distinct fruit tissues, pericarp and locular tissue. However, ploidy profiles differed significantly between these two tissues suggesting a tissue-specific control of endoreduplication in tomato fruit. To determine possible relationships between endoreduplication and epigenetic mechanisms, the methylation status of genomic DNA from pericarp and locular tissue of tomato fruit was analysed. Pericarp genomic DNA was characterized by an increase of CG and/or CNG methylation at the 5S and 18S rDNA loci and at gyspsy-like retrotransposon sequences during fruit growth. A sharp decrease of the global DNA methylation level together with a reduction of methylation at the rDNA loci was also observed in pericarp during fruit ripening. Inversely, no major variation of DNA methylation either global or locus-specific, was observed in locular tissue. Thus, tissue-specific variations of DNA methylation are unlikely to be triggered by the induction of endoreduplication in fruit tissues, but may reflect tissue-specific ploidy profiles. Expression analysis of eight putative tomato DNA methyltransferases encoding genes showed that one chromomethylase (CMT) and two rearranged methyltransferases (DRMs) are preferentially expressed in the pericarp during fruit growth and could be involved in the locus-specific increase of methylation observed at this developmental phase in the pericarp."

Proper DNA methylation patterning requires the complementary processes of de novo methylation (the initial methylation of unmethylated DNA sequences) and maintenance methylation (the faithful replication of preexisting methylation). Arabidopsis has two types of methyltransferases with demonstrated maintenance activity: MET1, which maintains CpG methylation and is homologous to mammalian DNMT1, and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), which maintains CpNpG (N = A, T, C, or G) methylation and is unique to the plant kingdom. Here we describe loss-of-function mutations in the Arabidopsis DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE (DRM) genes and provide evidence that they encode de novo methyltransferases. drm1 drm2 double mutants retained preexisting CpG methylation at the endogenous FWA locus but blocked de novo CpG methylation that is normally associated with FWA transgene silencing. Furthermore, drm1 drm2 double mutants blocked de novo CpNpG and asymmetric methylation and gene silencing of the endogenous SUPERMAN (SUP) gene, which is normally triggered by an inverted SUP repeat. However, drm1 drm2 double mutants did not show reactivation of previously established SUPERMAN epigenetic silenced alleles. Thus, drm mutants prevent the establishment but not the maintenance of gene silencing at FWA and SUP, suggesting that the DRMs encode the major de novo methylation enzymes affecting these genes."

Many plant, animal, and fungal genomes contain cytosine DNA methylation in asymmetric sequence contexts (CpHpH, H = A, T, C). Although the enzymes responsible for this methylation are unknown, it has been assumed that asymmetric methylation is maintained by the persistent activity of de novo methyltransferases (enzymes capable of methylating previously unmodified DNA). We recently reported that the DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE (DRM) genes are required for de novo DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana because drm1 drm2 double mutants lack the de novo methylation normally associated with transgene silencing. In this study, we have used bisulfite sequencing and Southern blot analysis to examine the role of the DRM loci in the maintenance of asymmetric methylation. At some loci, drm1 drm2 double mutants eliminated all asymmetric methylation. However, at the SUPERMAN locus, asymmetric methylation was only completely abolished in drm1 drm2 chromomethylase 3 (cmt3) triple mutant plants. drm1 drm2 double mutants also showed a strong reduction of CpNpG (n = A, T, C, or G) methylation at some loci, but not at others. The drm1 drm2 cmt3 triple mutant plants did not affect CpG methylation at any locus tested, suggesting that the primary CpG methylases are encoded by the MET1 class of genes. Although neither the drm1 drm2 double mutants nor the cmt3 single mutants show morphological defects, drm1 drm2 cmt3 triple mutant plants show pleiotropic effects on plant development. Our results suggest that the DRM and CMT3 genes act in a partially redundant and locus-specific manner to control asymmetric and CpNpG methylation."

A structural model-building approach was used to test the extent to which family and peer variables directly or indirectly affected ASD via child anxiety/depression. The sample (N = 322) consisted of parents of children with ASD referred to two specialist clinics. The sample contained parents of children with Autistic Disorder (n = 76), Asperger Disorder (n = 188), Pervasive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (n = 21), and children with a non-ASD or no diagnosis (n = 37). Parents completed questionnaires on-line via a secure website. The key findings were that anxiety/depression and ASD symptomatology were significantly related, and family conflict was more predictive of ASD symptomatology than positive family/peer influences.

OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to examine rates of psychotropic medication use and identify associated child and family characteristics among children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) enrolled in an autism registry maintained by the Autism Treatment Network (ATN). METHODS The sample, derived from the ATN registry, consists of 2853 children aged 2 to 17 years with diagnoses of ASD supported by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule with available data on medication use. As part of initial enrollment in the registry, parents completed questionnaires on current psychotropic medication use, psychiatric and medical conditions, and demographics. RESULTS Of the 2853 children, 763 (27%) were taking \u2265 1 psychotropic medication; 15% were prescribed 1 medication, 7.4% received 2 medications, and 4.5% received \u2265 3. Among children aged 3 to 5 years, 11% were taking \u2265 1 psychotropic medication; among 6- to 11-year-old children, 46%; and 66% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years were taking at \u2265 1 psychotropic medication. A parent report of comorbid diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or anxiety was associated with a high rate of use, with 80% receiving \u2265 1 psychotropic medication. Only 15% of children with no comorbid psychiatric disorder were taking psychotropic medication. Psychotropic medication use was also related to sleep and gastrointestinal problems. CONCLUSIONS The prescription of psychotropic medications in this registry sample is highly related to comorbid psychiatric disorder. Other factors associated with use include medical comorbidities, race, ethnicity, and older age."

RATIONALE Altered cognitive function is a common feature of both the early and later stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) that involves alterations in cortical dopamine content. Adenosine A2A antagonists, such as istradefylline, improve motor function in PD, but their effect on cognitive impairment has not been determined. OBJECTIVE The present study investigated whether impairment of working memory due to the loss of dopaminergic input into the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is reversed by administration of istradefylline. We also evaluated whether A2A antagonist administration modulates dopamine levels in the PFC. METHODS Bilateral lesions of the dopaminergic input to the PFC were produced in rats using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Cognitive performance was evaluated using an object recognition task and delayed alternation task. The effects of istradefylline, donepezil and methamphetamine on cognitive performance were examined. In addition, the effect of istradefylline on extracellular dopamine levels in the PFC was studied. RESULTS PFC dopamine levels and cognitive performance were significantly reduced by 6-OHDA lesioning. Istradefylline, donepezil and methamphetamine improved cognitive performance of PFC-lesioned rats. Istradefylline increased dopamine levels in the PFC in both normal and PFC-lesioned rats. CONCLUSIONS PFC dopaminergic input plays an important role in working memory performance. Blockade of A2A receptors using istradefylline reverses the changes in cognitive function, and this may be due to an increase in PFC dopamine content. Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists not only improve motor performance in PD but may also lead to improved cognition."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population older than 60 years. Classically, PD is considered to be a motor system disease and its diagnosis is based on the presence of a set of cardinal motor signs (rigidity, bradykinesia, rest tremor) that are consequence of a pronounced death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Nowadays there is considerable evidence showing that non-dopaminergic degeneration also occurs in other brain areas which seems to be responsible for the deficits in olfactory, emotional and memory functions that precede the classical motor symptoms in PD. The present review attempts to examine results reported in epidemiological, clinical and animal studies to provide a comprehensive picture of the antiparkinsonian potential of caffeine. Convergent epidemiological and pre-clinical data suggest that caffeine may confer neuroprotection against the underlying dopaminergic neuron degeneration, and influence the onset and progression of PD. The available data also suggest that caffeine can improve the motor deficits of PD and that adenosine A2A receptor antagonists such as istradefylline reduces OFF time and dyskinesia associated with standard 'dopamine replacement' treatments. Finally, recent experimental findings have indicated the potential of caffeine in the management of non-motor symptoms of PD, which do not improve with the current dopaminergic drugs. Altogether, the studies reviewed provide strong evidence that caffeine may represent a promising therapeutic tool in PD, thus being the first compound to restore both motor and non-motor early symptoms of PD together with its neuroprotective potential."

Neurotransmitters other than dopamine, such as norepinephrine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, glutamate, adenosine and acetylcholine, are involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contribute to its symptomatology. Thus, the progress of non-dopaminergic therapies for PD has attracted much interest in recent years. Among new classes of drugs, adenosine A2A antagonists have emerged as promising candidates. The development of new highly selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonists, and their encouraging anti-parkinsonian responses in animal models of PD, has provided a rationale for clinical trials to evaluate the therapeutic potential and the safety of these agents in patients with PD. To date, the clinical research regarding A2A antagonists and their potential utilization in PD therapy continues to evolve between drugs just or previously discontinued (preladenant and vipadenant), new derivatives in development (tozadenant, PBF-509, ST1535, ST4206 and V81444) and the relatively old drug istradefylline, which has finally been licensed as an anti-parkinsonian drug in Japan. All these compounds have been shown to have a good safety profile and be well tolerated. Moreover, results from phase II and III trials also demonstrate that A2A antagonists are effective in reducing off-time, without worsening troublesome dyskinesia, and in increasing on-time with a mild increase of non-troublesome dyskinesia, in patients at an advanced stage of PD treated with L-DOPA. In addition, early findings suggest that A2A antagonists might also be efficacious as monotherapy in patients at an early stage of PD.

These include alpha2 adrenergic receptor antagonists (eg, fipamezole), adenosine A2A receptor antagonists (eg, istradefylline), AMPA receptor antagonists (eg, talampanel), neuronal synchronization modulators (eg, levetiracetam) and agents that interact with serotonergic systems such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A agonists (eg, sarizotan) and 5-HT2A antagonists (eg, quetiapine). Lastly, we examine a growing number of neuroprotective agents that seek to halt or even reverse disease progression. These include anti-apoptotic kinase inhibitors (eg, CEP-1347), modulators of mitochondrial function (eg, creatine), growth factors (eg, leteprinim), neuroimmunophilins (eg, V-10367), estrogens (eg, MITO-4509), c-synuclein oligomerization inhibitors (eg, PAN-408) and sonic hedgehog ligands."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, affecting up to 10 million people worldwide. Current treatment primarily involves symptom management with dopaminergic replacement therapy. Levodopa remains the most effective oral treatment, although long-term use is associated with complications such as wearing off, dyskinesias, and on-off fluctuations. Non-dopaminergic medications that improve PD symptoms and motor fluctuations are in demand. Adenosine A2A receptors are abundantly expressed within the basal ganglia and offer a unique target to modify abnormal striatal signaling associated with PD. Preclinical animal models have shown the ability of adenosine A2A receptor antagonists to improve PD motor symptoms, reduce motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, as well as protect against toxin-induced neuronal degeneration. Both istradefylline and preladenant have demonstrated moderate efficacy in reducing off time in PD patients with motor fluctuations. The safety and efficacy of this class of compounds continues to be defined and future studies should focus on non-motor symptoms, dyskinesias, and neuroprotection."

Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists represent a new way forward in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) through a non-dopaminergic mechanism. As a class, adenosine A2A antagonists are effective in reversing motor deficits in haloperidol-treated rodents, 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, and MPTP-treated primates when combined with low doses of l-dopa or dopamine agonist drugs. Importantly, they improve motor function without worsening dyskinesia and they may prevent the onset of involuntary movements. Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists are active in animal models of reduced cognition, anxiety, and depression and so this drug class may also be effective in controlling the neuropsychiatric components of nonmotor symptoms in PD. Preclinical evidence has shown that A2A antagonists can prevent neuronal loss in experimental models of PD and their disease modifying activity needs to be explored in man. Importantly, a number of A2A antagonists have been studied in PD in clinical trial for their effects on motor function. So far, little evidence has emerged of an effect of monotherapy with adenosine antagonists in early PD. However, in later stage, patient populations already treated with dopaminergic drugs but exhibiting \"wearing off,\" adenosine antagonists have been demonstrated to reduce \"off\" time without increasing troublesome dyskinesia in phase IIB trials. However, in larger phase III evaluations, a consistent significant decrease in \"off\" time has proved more difficult to demonstrate-due in part to trial conduct. So far, only istradefylline has completed phase III development and it is now marketed for the treatment of PD. Adenosine A2A antagonists are the first non-dopaminergic approach to the treatment of PD to appear in the recent era. They represent a novel way of approaching therapy that will provide additional benefit to that achieved with dopaminergic medication, while avoiding common side effects and may in addition, improve some nonmotor symptoms of PD that are currently poorly treated."

Long-term disability in Parkinson's disease (PD) is related to progression of the underlying disease and the emergence of complications of chronic levodopa therapy. There is a need for new medications that can slow the underlying progression of degeneration, improve PD symptoms in early disease without inducing dyskinesia, and improve motor fluctuations and 'off' time in advanced disease without worsening dyskinesia. Much interest has focused on the development of nondopaminergic therapies, with antagonists of the adenosine A2A receptor emerging as leading candidates. A2A receptors are selectively expressed in the basal ganglia and specific A2A antagonists reverse motor deficits without causing dyskinesia in animal models of PD. The antiparkinsonian potential of A2A receptor blockade has been expanded further by convergent epidemiological and laboratory findings suggesting a possible neuroprotective effect of A2A receptor antagonists in PD. Istradefylline (KW-6002) is the first of several adenosine A2A receptor antagonists in development for PD to advance to phase III clinical trials. Initial studies indicate that in patients with motor fluctuations on levodopa, addition of istradefylline reduces 'off' time. Additional studies are necessary to evaluate the benefit of istradefylline as monotherapy in early disease, its effect on the development of dyskinesia, and its effect on disease progression."

INTRODUCTION Recent experimental and clinical research has shown that A2A adenosine receptor antagonism can bring about an improvement in the motor behavior of patients with Parkinson's disease. Istradefylline , a xanthine derivative, has the longest half-life of all the currently available A2A adenosine receptor antagonists; it can successfully permeate through the blood-brain barrier and has a high human A2A adenosine receptor affinity. AREAS COVERED In this article, the author discusses the potential role of A2A adenosine receptor antagonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease through the evaluation of istradefylline. Specifically, the article reviews the clinical and pharmacokinetic information available to elucidate its therapeutic potential. EXPERT OPINION A2A adenosine receptor antagonists are efficacious in combination with l-dopa. l-dopa has a complex pharmacokinetic behavior and causes long-term behavioral and metabolic side effects. Future research on A2A adenosine receptor antagonism should consider compounds like istradefylline as l-dopa and/or dopamine agonist-sparing treatment alternatives, since their clinical handling, safety and side-effect profile are superior to l-dopa and/or dopamine agonists. The current focus to demonstrate a specific dyskinesia-ameliorating efficacy of A2A adenosine receptor antagonism in clinical trials is risky, since the presentation of dyskinesia varies on a day-to-day basis and is considerably influenced by peripheral l-dopa metabolism. The demonstration of an antidyskinetic effect may convince authorities, but this is far less relevant in clinical practice as patients generally better tolerate dyskinesia than other phenomena and dopaminergic side effects."

OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate for prophylaxis of migraine and cluster headache via a retrospective chart analysis. BACKGROUND Topiramate has multiple mechanisms of action that could potentially contribute to migraine prophylaxis. We conducted a retrospective chart review to assess the efficacy of topiramate as add-on therapy in patients with transformed migraine or cluster headache, and as first-line therapy in patients with episodic migraine. METHODS Patients diagnosed with transformed migraine, episodic migraine, or cluster headache, who received topiramate either as add-on therapy or monotherapy were selected via retrospective chart review. Patients had begun topiramate therapy at 25 mg/day for the first week and increased their dosage by 25 mg/week to a maximum of 200 mg/day. Topiramate was used as add-on therapy for patients with transformed migraine and cluster headache, and as a first-line monotherapy in patients with episodic migraine who had no previous prophylactic therapy. The outcome parameters examined included a mean 28-day migraine frequency, migraine severity, number of headache days/month, number of abortive medication tablets/month, patient global evaluation, and the MIDAS scale. RESULTS One hundred seventy-eight patients (transformed migraine: n = 96; episodic migraine: n = 70; and cluster headache: n = 12) were included in the retrospective analysis. The mean dose of topiramate for all patients was 87.5 mg/day. For patients with transformed migraine, mean migraine frequency decreased from 6.3/28 days to 3.7 (P = 0.005). Mean severity decreased from 7.1 to 3.8 on a 10-point scale, with 10 representing the most severe pain (P = 0.003). The mean number of headache days/month decreased from 22.1 to 9.6 (P = 0.001), and the mean number of abortive medication tablets decreased from 28.7/month to 10.6 (P = 0.001). Patient global evaluation indicated substantial or moderate improvement in 53% of patients with transformed migraine who used topiramate as add-on therapy. Mean MIDAS scale values decreased from 90.2 to 24.9 (P< 0.0001). The 70 episodic migraine patients who were administered topiramate as first-line therapy exhibited a decrease in mean migraine frequency (5.8/28 days to 1.9, P = 0.001), while mean migraine severity decreased from 8.1 to 2.0 (P = 0.003). Sixty-one percent of patients reported marked improvement. Nine of the 12 cluster headache patients exhibited substantial or moderate improvement in symptoms, whereas three had no improvement. The most common adverse effects were paresthesias (12%), cognitive effects (11%), and dizziness (6%). Eight patients discontinued topiramate due to adverse effects; cognitive effects were the most common reason. No patient discontinued topiramate treatment due to lack of efficacy. Twelve percent of patients lost more than 5 lbs during treatment (a range of 5-120 lbs). CONCLUSION For both patients with transformed migraine (add-on therapy) and patients with episodic migraine (first-line monotherapy), topiramate yielded significant reductions in migraine frequency, migraine severity, number of headache days/month, and use of abortive medications. Topiramate also appears to be well tolerated and useful in the adjunctive treatment of cluster headache. Prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled trials will be required to confirm our results."

This disorder can be differentiated from migraine by clinical and pathophysiologic features. Cluster headache also exhibits a differing therapeutic response to medications when compared with migraine. The pharmacologic treatment of cluster is reviewed in this article. In contrast to migraine, men are 3-4 times more likely to be diagnosed with cluster headache than women, and the cluster headache population is older. Cluster attacks are known for their brief intense unilateral excruciating pain during susceptible periods known as cluster periods, which typically last weeks. Attack-free months generally follow. Pain is experienced in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, with unilateral autonomic features. Most patients are successfully managed with medical therapy. Medication management can be divided into abortive treatments for an ongoing attack and prophylactic treatment. Prophylaxis aims to induce and maintain a remission. There are a variety of different medications for abortive and prophylactic therapy, accompanied by a variable amount of evidence-based medicine. For patients refractory to medical management, interventional procedures are available as a last resort.

A major goal of biomedical research is the identification of molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie memory storage. Here we report a previously unknown signaling pathway that is necessary for the conversion from short- to long-term memory. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2), which contains the regulatory protein Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), was discovered only recently and little is known about its function. We found that conditional deletion of Rictor in the postnatal murine forebrain greatly reduced mTORC2 activity and selectively impaired both long-term memory (LTM) and the late phase of hippocampal long-term potentiation (L-LTP).

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2 signaling is impaired in the brain, whereas mTORC1 signaling is unchanged. Rictor CKO mice have small brains and bodies, normal lifespan and are fertile. Cortical layering is normal, but neurons are smaller than those in control brains.

Both complexes are sensitive to a pharmacological inhibitor, torin1, although only mTORC1 is inhibited by rapamycin. Since mTORC2 is known to mediate the activation of a prosurvival kinase, Akt, we analyzed whether mTORC2 directly mediates Akt activation or whether it requires the participation of another prosurvival kinase, PKC\u03b5 (epsilon isoform of protein kinase-C). Our studies reveal that treatment of adult feline cardiomyocytes in vitro with insulin results in Akt phosphorylation at S473 for its activation which could be augmented with rapamycin but blocked by torin1. Silencing the expression of Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), an mTORC2 component, with a sh-RNA in cardiomyocytes lowers both insulin-stimulated Akt and PKC\u03b5 phosphorylation. Furthermore, phosphorylation of PKC\u03b5 and Akt at the critical S729 and S473 sites respectively was blocked by torin1 or Rictor knockdown but not by rapamycin, indicating that the phosphorylation at these specific sites occurs downstream of mTORC2. Additionally, expression of DN-PKC\u03b5 significantly lowered the insulin-stimulated Akt S473 phosphorylation, indicating an upstream role for PKC\u03b5 in the Akt activation.

BACKGROUND Sumoylation has emerged as an important posttranslational regulatory mechanism for transcription factors and cofactors. Sumoylation of many transcription factors represses their transcriptional activities. The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors plays an important role in regulating gene expression during myogenesis and has been recently shown to be sumoylated. RESULTS Consistent with earlier reports, we show that sumoylation of MEF2C at K391 inhibits its transcriptional activity. Sumoylation of MEF2C does not block its DNA-binding activity. A small C-terminal fragment of MEF2C containing K391, referred to as delta-N2-MEF2C, is efficiently sumoylated and, when targeted to DNA, represses transcription at neighbouring promoters. Because delta-N2-MEF2C lacks the binding site for class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), this result suggests that sumoylation of MEF2C may help to recruit transcriptional repressors other than these HDACs. Intriguingly, we show that phosphorylation of S396 in MEF2C, a residue in close proximity to the major sumoylation site (K391) and known to be phosphorylated in vivo, enhances sumoylation of delta- N2-MEF2C in vitro. The S396A mutation reduces sumoylation of MEF2C in vivo and enhances the transcription activity of MEF2C in reporter assays. CONCLUSION We propose that phosphorylation of MEF2C at S396 facilitates its sumoylation at K391, which in turn recruits yet unidentified co-repressors to inhibit transcription. Our studies further suggest that sumoylation motifs containing a phosphorylated serine or an acidic residue at the +5 position might be more efficiently sumoylated."

However, the mechanisms that link sumoylation to alterations in chromatin structure, which culminate in tissue specific gene expression, are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that SUMO modification of the transcription factor Sharp-1 is required for its full transcriptional repression activity and function as an inhibitor of skeletal muscle differentiation. Sharp-1 is modified by sumoylation at two conserved lysine residues 240 and 255. Mutation of these SUMO acceptor sites in Sharp-1 does not impact its subcellular localization but attenuates its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor and inhibit myogenic differentiation. Consistently, co-expression of the SUMO protease SENP1 with wild type Sharp-1 abrogates Sharp-1-dependent inhibition of myogenesis. Interestingly, sumoylation acts as a signal for recruitment of the co-repressor G9a. Thus, enrichment of G9a, and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), a signature of G9a activity, is dramatically reduced at muscle promoters in cells expressing sumoylation-defective Sharp-1.

Here, we report the (1)H, (13)C and (15)N backbone and side-chain resonance assignments of the N-terminal ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs) of USP25 with BMRB accession number of 19111, which is the first step of the systematic structural biology study of the enzyme."

BACKGROUND Postoperative delirium can result in increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, major demand for postoperative care and higher hospital costs. Hypnotics serve to induce and maintain anaesthesia and to abolish patients' consciousness. Their persisting clinical action can delay postoperative cognitive recovery and favour postoperative delirium. Some evidence suggests that these unwanted effects vary according to each hypnotic's specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics and its interaction with the individual patient.We designed this study to evaluate postoperative delirium rate after general anaesthesia with various hypnotics in patients undergoing surgical procedures other than cardiac or brain surgery. We also aimed to test whether delayed postoperative cognitive recovery increases the risk of postoperative delirium. METHODS/DESIGN After local ethics committee approval, enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. In all patients anaesthesia will be induced with propofol and fentanyl, and maintained with the anaesthetics desflurane, or sevoflurane, or propofol and the analgesic opioid fentanyl.The onset of postoperative delirium will be monitored with the Nursing Delirium Scale every three hours up to 72 hours post anaesthesia. Cognitive function will be evaluated with two cognitive test batteries (the Short Memory Orientation Memory Concentration Test and the Rancho Los Amigos Scale) preoperatively, at baseline, and postoperatively at 20, 40 and 60 min after extubation.Statistical analysis will investigate differences in the hypnotics used to maintain anaesthesia and the odds ratios for postoperative delirium, the relation of early postoperative cognitive recovery and postoperative delirium rate. A subgroup analysis will be used to categorize patients according to demographic variables relevant to the risk of postoperative delirium (age, sex, body weight) and to the preoperative score index for delirium. DISCUSSION The results of this comparative anaesthesiological trial should whether each the three hypnotics tested is related to a significantly different postoperative delirium rate. This information could ultimately allow us to select the most appropriate hypnotic to maintain anaesthesia for specific subgroups of patients and especially for those at high risk of postoperative delirium.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Sugammadex, a modified gamma-cyclodextrin, is a selective relaxant-binding agent designed to reverse the effects of the steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents rocuronium or vecuronium. This study compared the efficacy of sugammadex and neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium for facilitating elective surgery. METHODS This randomised, multicentre, parallel-group trial included 98 adult patients. Patients received intravenous propofol for induction followed by sevoflurane maintenance anaesthesia. Neuromuscular blockade was monitored using acceleromyography and a train-of-four (TOF) mode of stimulation. Patients were randomly allocated to receive sugammadex 2.0 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 50 microg kg (-1) (with glycopyrrolate 10 microg kg(-1)) at reappearance of the second response of the TOF (mean 16% twitch height of first response) after the last dose of rocuronium. Safety was evaluated by assessing adverse events, laboratory variables and vital signs. RESULTS Time to recovery of the TOF ratio of 0.9 after sugammadex compared with neostigmine was significantly shorter (P < 0.0001), being 1.5 versus 18.6 min (geometric means). Predictability of response was greater with sugammadex than neostigmine: with 98% of sugammadex patients versus 11% of neostigmine patients recovering to a TOF ratio of 0.9 within 5 min. There were no clinical events related to residual neuromuscular blockade or reoccurrence of blockade. Serious adverse events were observed in two sugammadex-treated patients and in three neostigmine-treated patients, respectively, but none were considered related to study drugs. CONCLUSION Sugammadex achieved significantly faster recovery of neuromuscular function after rocuronium to a TOF ratio of 0.9 compared with neostigmine (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00451217)."

BACKGROUND The time to recovery from vapour anaesthesia is shortened by an increase in ventilation while maintaining normocapnia. Hypercapnia during emergence from anaesthesia in spontaneously breathing patients also increases anaesthetic clearance from the brain by increasing cerebral blood flow. We hypothesised that hypercapnia-induced hyperpnoea accelerates emergence from sevoflurane anaesthesia compared to the standard anaesthesia protocol. METHODS After Ethics Review Board approval, 44 ASA I-III patients undergoing elective gynaecological surgery were randomised after surgery to either hypercapnic hyperpnoea or control groups. In the hypercapnic hyperpnoea group, the end-tidal CO2 was adjusted to a range of 6.0-7.3 kPa to maintain a minute ventilation of 10-15 l/min. Recovery indices were compared using unpaired t-tests and ANOVA. RESULTS Prior to extubation, minute ventilation and end-tidal CO2 in hypercapnic hyperpnoea and control groups were 10.3 \u00b1 1.7 l/min vs. 5.4 \u00b1 1.2 l/min (P < 0.001) and 6.6 \u00b1 0.6 kPa and 5.2 \u00b1 0.5 kPa (P < 0.001), respectively.

Prior reports suggest that dreaming during anaesthesia is dependent on recovery time. Dreaming during sedation may impact patient satisfaction. The current study explores the incidence and content of dreaming during short-term sedation with sevoflurane or propofol and investigates whether dreaming is affected by recovery time. A total of 200 women undergoing first trimester abortion (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I) participated in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either sevoflurane or propofol for short-term sedation. Patients were interviewed upon emergence with the modified Brice questionnaire. The results showed the incidence of dreaming was significantly different between anaesthesia groups with 60% (60/100) of the sevoflurane group and 33% (33/100) of the propofol group (P=0.000). However, recovery time did not significantly differ between groups. In the sevoflurane group, a greater number of dreamers could not recall what they had dreamed about (P=0.02) and more patients reported dreams that had no sound (P=0.03) or movement (P=0.001) compared with dreamers in the propofol group. Most participants reported dreams with positive emotional content and this did not significantly differ between groups. Anaesthesia administered had no effect on patient satisfaction.

A further aim was to evaluate the clinical viability of these techniques as an alternative to general anaesthesia. In total, 697 children too anxious for management with relative analgesia and requiring invasive dental procedure for which a general anaesthetic would usually be required, were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups given the following interventions: group 1 - a combination of inhaled medical air and titrated intravenous midazolam, group 2 - a combination of inhaled 40% nitrous oxide in oxygen and titrated intravenous midazolam, and group 3 - a combination of an inhaled mixture of sevoflurane 0.3% and nitrous oxide 40% in oxygen with titrated intravenous midazolam. The primary outcome measure was successful completion of the intended dental treatment with a co-operative child responsive to verbal commands. In group 1, 54% (94/174 children) successfully completed treatment. In group 2, 80% (204/256 children) and in group 3, 93% (249/267 children) completed treatment. This difference was significant at the 1% level.

BACKGROUND Myocardial ischemic damage is reduced by volatile anaesthetics in patients undergoing low-risk coronary artery bypass graft surgery; few and discordant results exist in other settings. We therefore performed a randomised controlled trial (sevoflurane vs. propofol) to compare cardiac troponin release in patients with coronary disease undergoing mitral surgery. METHODS Patients with coronary artery disease undergoing mitral surgery were randomly allocated to receive either sevoflurane (50 patients) or propofol (50 patients) as main hypnotic. The primary endpoint of the study was peak post-operative cardiac troponin release defined as the maximum value among the post-operative values measured at intensive care unit arrival, 4 h later, on the first and second post-operative day. RESULTS There was no significant difference in post-operative peak troponin release, the median (25th-75th percentiles) values being 14.9 (10.1-22.1) ng/ml and 14.5 (8.8-17.6) ng/ml in the sevoflurane and propofol groups, respectively (P = 0.4). Fentanyl administration was different between the two groups: 1347 \u00b1 447 \u03bcg in patients receiving sevoflurane and 1670 \u00b1 469 \u03bcg in those receiving propofol, P = 0.002. The 1-year follow-up identified two patients who died in the propofol group (one myocardial infarction and one low cardiac output syndrome) and one in the sevoflurane group (myocardial infarction). CONCLUSION In this study, patients with coronary artery disease undergoing mitral surgery did not benefit from the cardioprotective properties of halogenated anaesthetics. Sevoflurane anaesthesia was not associated to lower cardiac troponin release when compared with propofol anaesthesia."

A homozygous mutational change in the Ataxia-Telangiectasia and RAD3 related (ATR) gene was previously reported in two related families displaying Seckel Syndrome (SS). Here, we provide the first identification of a Seckel Syndrome patient with mutations in ATRIP, the gene encoding ATR-Interacting Protein (ATRIP), the partner protein of ATR required for ATR stability and recruitment to the site of DNA damage. The patient has compound heterozygous mutations in ATRIP resulting in reduced ATRIP and ATR expression. A nonsense mutational change in one ATRIP allele results in a C-terminal truncated protein, which impairs ATR-ATRIP interaction; the other allele is abnormally spliced. We additionally describe two further unrelated patients native to the UK with the same novel, heterozygous mutations in ATR, which cause dramatically reduced ATR expression. All patient-derived cells showed defective DNA damage responses that can be attributed to impaired ATR-ATRIP function. Seckel Syndrome is characterised by microcephaly and growth delay, features also displayed by several related disorders including Majewski (microcephalic) osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD) type II and Meier-Gorlin Syndrome (MGS). The identification of an ATRIP-deficient patient provides a novel genetic defect for Seckel Syndrome. Coupled with the identification of further ATR-deficient patients, our findings allow a spectrum of clinical features that can be ascribed to the ATR-ATRIP deficient sub-class of Seckel Syndrome. ATR-ATRIP patients are characterised by extremely severe microcephaly and growth delay, microtia (small ears), micrognathia (small and receding chin), and dental crowding. While aberrant bone development was mild in the original ATR-SS patient, some of the patients described here display skeletal abnormalities including, in one patient, small patellae, a feature characteristically observed in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome.

Recently, mutations in the ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6 genes, encoding components of the pre-replication complex, have been identified. This complex is essential for DNA replication and therefore mutations are expected to impair cell proliferation and consequently could globally reduce growth. However, detailed growth characteristics of MGS patients have not been reported, and so this is addressed here through study of 45 MGS patients, the largest cohort worldwide. Here, we report that growth velocity (length) is impaired in MGS during pregnancy and first year of life, but, thereafter, height increases in paralleled normal reference centiles, resulting in a mean adult height of -4.5 standard deviations (SD). Height is dependent on ethnic background and underlying molecular cause, with ORC1 and ORC4 mutations causing more severe short stature and microcephaly. Growth hormone therapy (n = 9) was generally ineffective, though in two patients with significantly reduced IGF1 levels, growth was substantially improved by GH treatment, with 2SD and 3.8 SD improvement in height. Growth parameters for monitoring growth in future MGS patients are provided and as well we highlight that growth is disproportionately affected in certain structures, with growth related minor genital abnormalities (42%) and mammary hypoplasia (100%) frequently present, in addition to established effects on ears and patellar growth."

BACKGROUND Alpha-helical transmembrane (TM) proteins are involved in a wide range of important biological processes such as cell signaling, transport of membrane-impermeable molecules, cell-cell communication, cell recognition and cell adhesion. Many are also prime drug targets, and it has been estimated that more than half of all drugs currently on the market target membrane proteins. However, due to the experimental difficulties involved in obtaining high quality crystals, this class of protein is severely under-represented in structural databases. In the absence of structural data, sequence-based prediction methods allow TM protein topology to be investigated. RESULTS We present a support vector machine-based (SVM) TM protein topology predictor that integrates both signal peptide and re-entrant helix prediction, benchmarked with full cross-validation on a novel data set of 131 sequences with known crystal structures. The method achieves topology prediction accuracy of 89%, while signal peptides and re-entrant helices are predicted with 93% and 44% accuracy respectively. An additional SVM trained to discriminate between globular and TM proteins detected zero false positives, with a low false negative rate of 0.4%. We present the results of applying these tools to a number of complete genomes. Source code, data sets and a web server are freely available from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/. CONCLUSION The high accuracy of TM topology prediction which includes detection of both signal peptides and re-entrant helices, combined with the ability to effectively discriminate between TM and globular proteins, make this method ideally suited to whole genome annotation of alpha-helical transmembrane proteins."

This paper presents a Hidden Markov Model (referred to as HMM_RA) that can predict the topology of alpha-helical transmembrane proteins with improved performance. HMM_RA adopts the same structure as the HMMTOP method, which has five modules: inside loop, inside helix tail, membrane helix, outside helix tail and outside loop. Each module consists of one or multiple states. HMM_RA allows using reduced alphabets to encode protein sequences. Thus, each state of HMM_RA is associated with n emission probabilities, where n is the size of the reduced alphabet set. Direct comparisons using two standard data sets show that HMM_RA consistently outperforms HMMTOP and TMHMM in topology prediction. Specifically, on a high-quality data set of 83 proteins, HMM_RA outperforms HMMTOP by up to 7.6% in topology accuracy and 6.4% in alpha-helices location accuracy. On the same data set, HMM_RA outperforms TMHMM by up to 6.4% in topology accuracy and 2.9% in location accuracy.

During the last two decades a large number of computational methods have been developed for predicting transmembrane protein topology. Current predictors rely on topogenic signals in the protein sequence, such as the distribution of positively charged residues in extra-membrane loops and the existence of N-terminal signals. However, phosphorylation and glycosylation are post-translational modifications (PTMs) that occur in a compartment-specific manner and therefore the presence of a phosphorylation or glycosylation site in a transmembrane protein provides topological information. We examine the combination of phosphorylation and glycosylation site prediction with transmembrane protein topology prediction. We report the development of a Hidden Markov Model based method, capable of predicting the topology of transmembrane proteins and the existence of kinase specific phosphorylation and N/O-linked glycosylation sites along the protein sequence.

An inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading to cross-reaction between the two types of predictions. To improve predictions further, it is therefore important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes. In addition, topology information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus of the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1% to 3.9% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0% to 7.7%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to TMHMM/SignalP, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions.

MOTIVATION Many important biological processes such as cell signaling, transport of membrane-impermeable molecules, cell-cell communication, cell recognition and cell adhesion are mediated by membrane proteins. Unfortunately, as these proteins are not water soluble, it is extremely hard to experimentally determine their structure. Therefore, improved methods for predicting the structure of these proteins are vital in biological research. In order to improve transmembrane topology prediction, we evaluate the combined use of both integrated signal peptide prediction and evolutionary information in a single algorithm. RESULTS A new method (MEMSAT3) for predicting transmembrane protein topology from sequence profiles is described and benchmarked with full cross-validation on a standard data set of 184 transmembrane proteins. The method is found to predict both the correct topology and the locations of transmembrane segments for 80% of the test set. This compares with accuracies of 62-72% for other popular methods on the same benchmark. By using a second neural network specifically to discriminate transmembrane from globular proteins, a very low overall false positive rate (0.5%) can also be achieved in detecting transmembrane proteins.

BACKGROUND Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been extensively used in computational molecular biology, for modelling protein and nucleic acid sequences. In many applications, such as transmembrane protein topology prediction, the incorporation of limited amount of information regarding the topology, arising from biochemical experiments, has been proved a very useful strategy that increased remarkably the performance of even the top-scoring methods. However, no clear and formal explanation of the algorithms that retains the probabilistic interpretation of the models has been presented so far in the literature. RESULTS We present here, a simple method that allows incorporation of prior topological information concerning the sequences at hand, while at the same time the HMMs retain their full probabilistic interpretation in terms of conditional probabilities. We present modifications to the standard Forward and Backward algorithms of HMMs and we also show explicitly, how reliable predictions may arise by these modifications, using all the algorithms currently available for decoding HMMs. A similar procedure may be used in the training procedure, aiming at optimizing the labels of the HMM's classes, especially in cases such as transmembrane proteins where the labels of the membrane-spanning segments are inherently misplaced. We present an application of this approach developing a method to predict the transmembrane regions of alpha-helical membrane proteins, trained on crystallographically solved data. We show that this method compares well against already established algorithms presented in the literature, and it is extremely useful in practical applications.

BACKGROUND Transmembrane (TM) proteins are proteins that span a biological membrane one or more times. As their 3-D structures are hard to determine, experiments focus on identifying their topology (i. e. which parts of the amino acid sequence are buried in the membrane and which are located on either side of the membrane), but only a few topologies are known. Consequently, various computational TM topology predictors have been developed, but their accuracies are far from perfect. The prediction quality can be improved by applying a consensus approach, which combines results of several predictors to yield a more reliable result. RESULTS A novel TM consensus method, named MetaTM, is proposed in this work. MetaTM is based on support vector machine models and combines the results of six TM topology predictors and two signal peptide predictors. On a large data set comprising 1460 sequences of TM proteins with known topologies and 2362 globular protein sequences it correctly predicts 86.7% of all topologies.

Based on the observation that there are functional domains that occur preferentially internal or external to the membrane, we have extended the model of TMHMM to incorporate functional domains, using a probabilistic approach originally developed for computational gene finding.

DESIGN Case report. SETTING Outpatient practice and university hospital. PATIENT(S) A 35-year-old woman who presented with infertility, amenorrhea, and an elevated basal estradiol concentration. INTERVENTION(S) Ultrasonography, laparoscopy, endocrinologic assays, magnetic resonance imaging, transsphenoidal surgery, and immunocytochemical staining. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Ultrasonography and laparoscopy demonstrated bilaterally enlarged ovaries containing multiple preovulatory follicles, similar in appearance in those women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with exogenous FSH. The serum estradiol level was moderately elevated, the FSH level was within the normal range, and LH was suppressed. Administration of leuprolide acetate resulted in very elevated estradiol concentrations and even larger ovarian cysts. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a sellar mass. Examination of the tissue excised by transsphenoidal excision of the mass showed a pituitary adenoma that stained strongly for FSH. RESULT(S) Regular menses resumed soon after excision of the gonadotroph adenoma, followed by a spontaneous pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS Gonadotroph adenoma should be suspected in a reproductive age woman with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, infertility, multiple preovulatory follicles, and a persistently elevated serum estradiol concentration. Exacerbation of the ovarian hyperstimulation in response to a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in this setting also strongly suggests a gonadotroph adenoma but can be avoided by recognizing the presenting features of this condition."

A study was undertaken to determine fertility status in a group of adult females who as children had been operated on for perforated appendicitis between 1957 to 1975. The 389 girls operated on for perforated appendicitis were reviewed. Their ages ranged from 10 months to 13 years at the time of appendicectomy. Of these girls, 276 were now 20 to 43 years old, and they were contacted by means of a mail questionnaire, and personal interview wherever necessary. It proved possible to contact 181 women; 102 of them were married and 79 were unmarried. Eight-four of the married women (82%) had one or more children. Nine unmarried women also had one or more children. Eighteen married women who have no children were studied in detail. Five women were on contraceptives, two desired pregnancy but had not conceived, and one patient was separated from her husband. Two patients had conceived and aborted, and two were married to infertile men. Of the remaining six patients who had been investigated for infertility, no demonstrable cause of infertility was found in three. Of the other three patients, one showed evidence of bilateral tubal occlusion secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease, one has had a right ectopic pregnancy followed by two abortions, and the third patient was found to have a pituitary adenoma. Our data show that perforated appendicitis before puberty has little if any role in the aetiology of tubal infertility."

While it can occur in men, it occurs more commonly in women. The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia ranges from 0.4% in an unselected normal adult population to as high as 9-17% in women with reproductive disorders. There are many possible causes of hyperprolactinemia, falling into three general categories: physiologic, pharmacologic and pathologic. When specific treatable underlying causes have been eliminated and in cases of severe hyperprolactinemia, the most likely cause is a prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Microadenomas should be treated medically, with a dopamine agonist, if there is an indication for therapy (such as amenorrhea, infertility or bothersome galactorrhea). If there is no indication for therapy, microadenomas may be followed conservatively, as growth is uncommon. Macroadenomas may grow larger; medical therapy is recommended initially, with neurosurgical evaluation reserved for specific clinical situations, such as failure of medical therapy and evidence of mass effect despite medical therapy. In the United States, the dopamine agonists indicated for treatment of hyperprolactinemia are bromocriptine and cabergoline. Bromocriptine is usually given once or twice daily, while cabergoline has a long duration of action and is given once or twice weekly. Results of comparative studies indicate that cabergoline is clearly superior to bromocriptine in efficacy (PRL suppression, restoration of gonadal function) and tolerability."

Thyroid hormones are of crucial importance for the functioning of nearly every organ. Remarkably, disturbances of thyroid hormone synthesis and function are among the most common endocrine disorders affecting approximately one third of the working German population. Over the last ten years our understanding of biosynthesis and functioning of these hormones has increased tremendously. This includes the identification of proteins involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis like Thox2 and Dehal where mutations in these genes are responsible for certain degrees of hypothyroidism. One of the most important findings was the identification of a specific transporter for triiodothyronine (T3), the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) responsible for directed transport of T3 into target cells and for export of thyroid hormones out of thyroid epithelial cells. Genetic disturbances of MCT8 in patients result in a biochemical constellation of high T3 levels in combination with low or normal TSH and thyroxine levels leading to a new syndrome of severe X-linked mental retardation. Importantly mice lacking MCT8 presented only with a mild phenotype, indicating that compensatory mechanisms exist in mice. Moreover, it has become clear that not only genomic actions of T3 exist. T3 is also capable to activate adhesion receptors and it signals via activation of PI3K and MAPK pathways. Most recently, thyroid hormone derivatives were identified, the thyronamines which are decarboxylated thyroid hormones initiating physiological actions like lowering body temperature and heart rate, thereby acting in opposite direction to the classical thyroid hormones. So far it is believed that thyronamines function via the activation of a G-protein coupled receptor, TAAR1. The objective of this review is to summarise the recent findings in thyroid hormone synthesis and action and to discuss their implications for diagnosis of thyroid disease and for treatment of patients."

TAAR1 and other receptors of this family are expressed in several tissues, including the heart. Functional effects have been observed after administration of exogenous T(1)AM: in the isolated heart, a negative inotropic and chronotropic action was produced, and the resistance to ischemic injury was increased, possibly as a consequence of an action on intracellular calcium homeostasis. Extracardiac effects include reduction of body temperature, increased lipid versus carbohydrate metabolism, and modulation of insulin secretion.

Their structure is identical to that of thyroid hormone and deiodinated thyroid hormone derivatives, except that TAMs do not possess a carboxylate group. Despite some initial publications dating back to the 1950s, TAMs did not develop into an independent area of research until 2004, when they were rediscovered as potential ligands to a class of G protein-coupled receptors called trace-amine associated receptors. Since this discovery, two representatives of TAMs, namely 3-iodothyronamine (3-T(1)AM) and thyronamine (T(0)AM), have been detected in vivo. Intraperitoneal or central injection of 3-T(1)AM or T(0)AM into mice, rats, or Djungarian hamsters caused various prompt effects, such as metabolic depression, hypothermia, negative chronotropy, negative inotropy, hyperglycemia, reduction of the respiratory quotient, ketonuria, and reduction of fat mass. Although their physiological function remains elusive, 3-T(1)AM and T(0)AM have already revealed promising therapeutic potential because they represent the only endogenous compounds inducing hypothermia as a prophylactic or acute treatment of stroke and might thus be expected to cause fewer side effects than synthetic compounds. This review article summarizes the still somewhat scattered data on TAMs obtained both recently and more than 20 yr ago to yield a complete and updated picture of the current state of TAM research."

Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), 3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities. We characterized several biochemical properties of SULTs using the thyronamines that acted as substrates for SULT activities in a human liver high-speed supernatant pool (n=3). T1AM led to the highest SULT activity. Activities with T0AM and T3AM were 10-fold lower, and there was no detectable activity with T2AM. Thyronamines were then tested as substrates with eight cDNA-expressed SULTs (1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1C2, 1E1, 2A1, 2B1a, and 2B1b). Expressed SULT1A3 had the greatest activity with T0AM, T1AM, and T3AM, whereas SULT1A1 showed similar activity only with T3AM. Expressed SULT1E1 had low activity with each substrate. T1AM, the most active thyronamine pharmacologically, was associated with the greatest SULT activity of the thyronamines tested in the liver pool and in both the expressed SULT1A3 and SULT1E1 preparations. Our results support the conclusion that sulfation contributes to the metabolism of thyronamines in human liver and that SULT activities may regulate the physiological effects of endogenous thyronamines."

Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia, decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines. We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p. thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v. (0.5 mg/kg) bolus infusion of T(1)AM, T(0)AM, or vehicle. To identify the peripheral effects of centrally administered thyronamines, drug-naive rats were also infused intravenously with low dose (0.5 mg/kg) thyronamines. Systemic T(1)AM rapidly increased EGP and plasma glucose, increased plasma glucagon, and corticosterone, but failed to change plasma insulin. Compared with i.p.-administered T(1)AM, a 100-fold lower dose administered centrally induced a more pronounced acute EGP increase and hyperglucagonemia while plasma insulin tended to decrease. Both systemic and central infusions of T(0)AM caused smaller increases in EGP, plasma glucose, and glucagon compared with T(1)AM. Neither T(1)AM nor T(0)AM influenced any of these parameters upon low dose i.v. administration. We conclude that central administration of low-dose thyronamines suffices to induce the acute alterations in glucoregulatory hormones and glucose metabolism following systemic thyronamine infusion. Our data indicate that thyronamines can act centrally to modulate glucose metabolism."

Trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR) are rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). TAAR are involved in modulation of neuronal, cardiac and vascular functions and they are potentially linked with neurological disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Subtype TAAR1, the best characterized TAAR so far, is promiscuous for a wide set of ligands and is activated by trace amines tyramine (TYR), phenylethylamine (PEA), octopamine (OA), but also by thyronamines, dopamine, and psycho-active drugs. Unfortunately, effects of trace amines on signaling of the two homologous \u03b2-adrenergic receptors 1 (ADRB1) and 2 (ADRB2) have not been clarified yet in detail. We, therefore, tested TAAR1 agonists TYR, PEA and OA regarding their effects on ADRB1/2 signaling by co-stimulation studies. Surprisingly, trace amines TYR and PEA are partial allosteric antagonists at ADRB1/2, whereas OA is a partial orthosteric ADRB2-antagonist and ADRB1-agonist. To specify molecular reasons for TAAR1 ligand promiscuity and for observed differences in signaling effects on particular aminergic receptors we compared TAAR, tyramine (TAR) octopamine (OAR), ADRB1/2 and dopamine receptors at the structural level. We found especially for TAAR1 that the remarkable ligand promiscuity is likely based on high amino acid similarity in the ligand-binding region compared with further aminergic receptors. On the other hand few TAAR specific properties in the ligand-binding site might determine differences in ligand-induced effects compared to ADRB1/2. Taken together, this study points to molecular details of TAAR1-ligand promiscuity and identified specific trace amines as allosteric or orthosteric ligands of particular \u03b2-adrenergic receptor subtypes."

Isolated rat hearts were perfused in the presence of trace amines, monitoring the hemodynamic variables. In addition, radioligand binding experiments with [3H]-p-tyramine and [125I]-3-iodothyronamine were performed in rat ventricular tissue. Octopamine, beta-phenylethylamine, and tryptamine produced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect as shown by reduced cardiac output (IC(50)=109 microM, 159 microM, and 242 microM, respectively). In the same preparation a similar effect was produced by thyronamine and 3-iodothyronamine, with IC(50)=94 microM and 27 microM, respectively. The negative inotropic effect of octopamine was confirmed in a papillary muscle preparation. All trace amines except tryptamine increased the heart rate, but this action could be attributed to their sympathomimetic properties, since it was abolished by propranolol. The negative inotropic effect of trace amines was significantly increased by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Specific and saturable binding of [(3)H]-p-tyramine and [125I]-3-iodothyronamine was observed in ventricular tissue. While [3H]-p-tyramine was displaced by 3-iodothyronamine, [(125)I]-3-iodothyronamine was not displaced by p-tyramine. In conclusion, trace amines and thyronamines are negative inotropic agents. Their effect appears to be mediated by a subtype of trace amine-associated receptor which is characterized by the rank of potency: 3-iodothyronamine > thyronamine = octopamine = beta-phenylethylamine, while tryptamine and p-tyramine are significantly less active."

BACKGROUND Non-invasive methods to assess the foetal genome during pregnancy will provide new opportunities to offer pregnant women a more comprehensive genetic diagnosis of their established foetus. The aim of this study was to determine the presence and frequency of foetal cells in transcervical cell (TCC) mucus samples from pregnant women and determine their suitability for early prenatal diagnosis. METHODS Syncytiotrophoblasts in aspirated TCC mucus samples were identified by immunostaining with the foetal-specific antibody NDOG1. Genetic analysis of foetal cells was performed by laser capture microdissection and quantitative fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR). RESULTS In 116 of 207 (56%) TCC samples, abundant syncytiotrophoblasts were retrieved. However, when TCC samples were stratified for the presence of chorionic villous fragments, syncytiotrophoblasts were identified in 85 of 109 (78%) samples. Significant numbers of syncytiotrophoblasts were found in TCC samples collected between 6 and 9weeks of gestation (mean 741, range 25-2884). QF-PCR analysis of NDOG1 positive syncytiotrophoblasts and matching maternal DNA confirmed their foetal origin and correct foetal cell sexing was achieved in 97% of TCC samples. The one discordant sex diagnosis was associated with a dizygotic dichorionic twin pregnancy resulting from the implantation of a female T21 embryo and a normal male embryo, where the female T21 foetus had succumbed at 6weeks of gestation and was vanishing. CONCLUSIONS Syncytiotrophoblasts can be successfully isolated from TCC samples and represent a suitable source of cells for genetic analysis of the established foetus in early pregnancy. The study highlights a vanishing twin as a potential cause for discordant non-invasive prenatal test results."

INTRODUCTION Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of Down syndrome is rapidly evolving. Currently, two applications for NIPD of Down syndrome have been developed with potential and have displayed positive results; the NIPD using next-generation sequencing technologies and the NIPD using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). AREAS COVERED The MeDIP real-time qPCR approach is based on the identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and their use for discriminating normal from Down syndrome cases. DMRs were identified using high-resolution oligo-arrays. A subgroup of DMRs was selected for further investigation. Through the design of a discriminant equation which combines the results obtained from different DMRs, normal and abnormal cases are correctly classified indicating 100% sensitivity and specificity. EXPERT OPINION Previous studies have also identified DMRs between non-pregnant female blood and placental DNA. However, these methods have been associated with a number of limitations including the low sensitivity and/or specificity of the assays, the limited number of identified DMRs or methylation sensitive sites and SNPs located on DMRs. These limitations have been overawed by the development of the MeDIP real-time qPCR-based methodology."

OBJECTIVE To study whether pregnant women would like to be informed if sex chromosomal abnormalities (SCA) were suspected with the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal Down syndrome (the NIFTY) test. METHODS Two hundred and one patients carried a singleton pregnancy requesting the NIFTY test were invited to give their preferences if there was suspicion of SCA by the NIFTY test. RESULTS Over 93.5% were ethnic Chinese, with a mean age of 36. Prior Down screening was positive in 66 (32.8%). Over 50% of subjects considered SCA to be better in terms of disability compared to Down syndrome, and only 5.2% considered SCA to be worse. Yet, the majority (198, 98.5%) indicated that they wanted to be informed if there was suspicion of SCA. Of whom 34.8% would have an amniocentesis for confirmation, while 57.1% were not certain, indicating the possibility of accepting these conditions. CONCLUSION Besides screening Down syndrome by NIFTY, most pregnant women would also like to be informed if there was suspicion of SCA. Those screened positive should be counseled by those with experience in genetics to avoid unnecessary pregnancy termination."

Although the first finding that fetal cells can enter the maternal circulation was made more than a century ago, it is still unclear if this finding will be translated into a clinically useful diagnostic tool in the foreseeable future. However, significant progress has been made via the analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma/serum and clinical services are now already being offered for the determination of fetal rhesus D status and sex. Currently, however, this technology is really only suited for the analysis of fetal genetic loci completely absent from the maternal genome. The detection of more subtle fetal genetic traits, such as point mutations involved in Mendelian disorders (thalassaemia, cystic fibrosis), is considerably more complex. Preliminary reports indicate that the detection of fetal aneuploidies might be possible using epigenetically modified genes, e.g. maspin on chromosome 18. Additionally, an exiting recent development is that it might be feasible to detect Down syndrome via the quantitative assessment of placentally derived cell-free mRNA of chromosome-21-specific genes such as PLAC4."

Both intact fetal cells as well as cell-free fetal DNA are present in the maternal circulation and can be recovered for non-invasive prenatal genetic diagnosis. Although methods for enrichment and isolation of rare intact fetal cells have been challenging, diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploidy including trisomy 21 in first- and second-trimester pregnancies has been achieved with a 50-75% detection rate. Similarly, cell-free fetal DNA can be reliably recovered from maternal plasma and assessed by quantitative PCR to detect fetal trisomy 21 and paternally derived single gene mutations. Real-time PCR assays are robust in detecting low-level fetal DNA concentrations, with sensitivity of approximately 95-100% and specificity near 100%. Comparing intact fetal cell versus cell-free fetal DNA methods for non-invasive prenatal screening for fetal chromosomal aneuploidy reveals that the latter is at least four times more sensitive. These preliminary results do not support a relationship between frequency of intact fetal cells and concentration of cell-free fetal DNA. The above results imply that the concentration of fetal DNA in maternal plasma may not be dependent on circulating intact fetal cells but rather be a product of growth and cellular turnover during embryonic or fetal development."

BACKGROUND Obtaining fetal DNA or RNA by either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis is currently, the gold standard prenatal diagnosis. However, these invasive procedures carry risk of miscarriage. A reliable method for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) has long been sought to reduce the risk of miscarriage. METHODS Cell-free fetal RNA was extracted from the plasma of peripheral blood from 121 women 9-20 weeks of pregnancy. Five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in PLAC4 gene were analyzed by reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (RT-MLPA), followed by capillary electrophoresis. Karyotype analysis was used for confirmation of prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21. RESULTS Of 121 samples, 23 were diagnosed with trisomy 21, 87 with normal ploidy, nine had all five SNP loci homozygous and two had one heterozygous SNP locus. Comparing with karyotype analysis, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of RT-MLPA were 92% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS RT-MLPA is a convenient and reliable method for the diagnosis of trisomy 21. We have shown that this method has good specificity, high sensitivity, and high throughput, making this technique applicable for NIPD in clinical practice."

This study examined the methylation difference in AIRE and RASSF1A between maternal and placental DNA, and the implication of this difference in the identification of free fetal DNA in maternal plasma and in prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21. Maternal plasma samples were collected from 388 singleton pregnancies, and placental or chorionic villus tissues from 112 of them. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion followed by fluorescent quantitative PCR (MSRE + PCR) were employed to detect the maternal-fetal methylation difference in AIRE and RASSF1A. Diagnosis of trisomy 21 was established according to the ratio of fetal-specific AIRE to RASSF1A in maternal plasma. Both methods confirmed that AIRE and RASSF1A were hypomethylated in maternal blood cells but hypermethylated in placental or chorionic villus tissues. Moreover, the differential methylation for each locus could be seen during the whole pregnant period. The positive rates of fetal AIRE and RASSF1A in maternal plasma were found to be 78.1% and 82.1% by MSP and 94.8% and 96.9% by MSRE + PCR. MSRE + PCR was superior to MSP in the identification of fetal-specific hypermethylated sequences (P<0.05). Based on the data from 266 euploidy pregnancies, the 95% reference interval of the fetal AIRE/RASSF1A ratio in maternal plasma was 0.33-1.77, which was taken as the reference value for determining the numbers of fetal chromosome 21 in 102 pregnancies. The accuracy rate in 98 euploidy pregnancies was 96.9% (95/98). Three of the four trisomy 21 pregnancies were confirmed with this method. It was concluded that hypermethylated AIRE and RASSF1A may serve as fetal-specific markers for the identification of fetal DNA in maternal plasma and may be used for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21."

This report describes the first identification and characterization of three chromosome-21-specific DNA sequences (and reference sequences from other chromosomes) that are differentially methylated between peripheral blood and placental tissue, with the aim of providing epigenetic biomarkers for quantifying cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma. To select sequences to be screened for differential methylation, three strategies were adopted: (i) investigating promoters of highly differentially expressed genes; (ii) choosing 'random' promoter regions; and (iii) choosing 'random' non-promoter regions. Over 200 pre-selected DNA sequences were screened using a methylation-specific restriction enzyme assay. Differentially methylated sequences located at 21q22.3 (AIRE, SIM2 and ERG genes), 1q32.1 (CD48 gene and FAIM3 gene), 2p14 (ARHGAP25 gene) and 12q24 (SELPLG gene) were identified. Bisulphite conversion confirmed that CpG sites within the AIRE promoter region are highly differentially methylated, and optimized methylation-specific primers for this region that are highly specific for placental DNA were devised. Next, it was shown that the methylation status of chorionic villus sample DNA from first trimester pregnancies matched the hypermethylated state of term placenta. Thus there is no indication of a difference in methylation status between early and term pregnancy for the sequences tested. The identified sequences constitute candidate biomarkers for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome."

OBJECTIVES To use proteomics to identify and characterize proteins in maternal serum from patients at high-risk for fetal trisomy 21, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13 on the basis of ultrasound and maternal serum triple tests. METHODS We performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis on 23 trisomy cases and 85 normal cases during the early second trimester of pregnancy. Protein profiling along with conventional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/Tandem mass spectrometry analysis was carried out to characterize proteins associated with each trisomy condition and later validated using Western blot. RESULTS Protein profiling approach using surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass (SELDI-TOF/MS) spectrometry resulted in the identification of 37 unique hydrophobic proteomic features for three trisomy conditions. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight/Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and western blot, glyco proteins such as alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein H, and serum carrier protein transthyretin were identified as potential maternal serum markers for fetal trisomy condition. The identified proteins showed differential expression at the subunit level.

The presence of foetal DNA in the plasma of pregnant women has opened up new possibilities for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. The use of circulating foetal DNA for the non-invasive prenatal detection of foetal chromosomal aneuploidies is challenging as foetal DNA represents a minor fraction of maternal plasma DNA. In 2007, it was shown that single molecule counting methods would allow the detection of the presence of a trisomic foetus, as long as enough molecules were counted. With the advent of massively parallel sequencing, millions or billions of DNA molecules can be readily counted. Using massively parallel sequencing, foetal trisomies 21, 13 and 18 have been detected from maternal plasma. Recently, large-scale clinical studies have validated the robustness of this approach for the prenatal detection of foetal chromosomal aneuploidies. A proof-of-concept study has also shown that a genome-wide genetic and mutational map of a foetus can be constructed from the maternal plasma DNA sequencing data. These developments suggest that the analysis of foetal DNA in maternal plasma would play an increasingly important role in future obstetrics practice. It is thus a priority that the ethical, social and legal issues regarding this technology be systematically studied."

We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed \"bivalent domains,\" consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells.

What are the evolutionary processes that led to the structural duplication and functional diversification of FgfD genes during vertebrate phylogeny? To study this question, we investigated conserved syntenies, patterns of gene expression, and the distribution of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in FgfD genes of stickleback and zebrafish, and compared them with data from cephalochordates, urochordates, and mammals. Genomic analysis suggests that Fgf8, Fgf17, Fgf18, and Fgf24 arose in two rounds of whole genome duplication at the base of the vertebrate radiation; that fgf8 and fgf18 duplications occurred at the base of the teleost radiation; and that Fgf24 is an ohnolog that was lost in the mammalian lineage. Expression analysis suggests that ancestral subfunctions partitioned between gene duplicates and points to the evolution of novel expression domains. Analysis of CNEs, at least some of which are candidate regulatory elements, suggests that ancestral CNEs partitioned between gene duplicates. These results help explain the evolutionary pathways by which the developmentally important family of FgfD molecules arose and the deduced principles that guided FgfD evolution are likely applicable to the evolution of developmental regulation in many vertebrate multigene families."

The abnormal development of neural crest cells (NCCs) leads to a broad spectrum of congenital malformation(s), termed neurocristopathies, and/or tumor predisposition. Here we review recent findings that disruptions of CNEs, within or at long distance from the coding sequences of key genes involved in NCC development, result in neurocristopathies via the alteration of tissue- or stage-specific long-distance regulation of gene expression. While most studies on human genetic disorders have focused on protein-coding sequences, these examples suggest that investigation of genomic alterations of CNEs will provide a broader understanding of the molecular etiology of both rare and common human congenital malformations."

Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development. Although most of these elements share little sequence identity to each other, a small number are remarkably similar and appear to be the product of duplication events. Here, we searched for duplicated conserved noncoding elements in the human genome, using comparisons with Fugu to select putative cis-regulatory sequences. We identified 124 families of duplicated elements, each containing between two and five members, that are highly conserved within and between vertebrate genomes. In 74% of cases, we were able to assign a specific set of paralogous genes with annotation relating to transcriptional regulation and/or development to each family, thus removing much of the ambiguity in identifying associated genes. We find that duplicate elements have the potential to up-regulate reporter gene expression in a tissue-specific manner and that expression domains often overlap, but are not necessarily identical, between family members. Over two thirds of the families are conserved in duplicate in fish and appear to predate the large-scale duplication events thought to have occurred at the origin of vertebrates. We propose a model whereby gene duplication and the evolution of cis-regulatory elements can be considered in the context of increased morphological diversity and the emergence of the modern vertebrate body plan."

Bystander genes are not specifically under the control of the regulatory elements that drive the target genes and are expressed in patterns that are different from those of the target genes. Reporter insertions distal to zebrafish developmental regulatory genes pax6.1/2, rx3, id1, and fgf8 and miRNA genes mirn9-1 and mirn9-5 recapitulate the expression patterns of these genes even if located inside or beyond bystander genes, suggesting that the regulatory domain of a developmental regulatory gene can extend into and beyond adjacent transcriptional units. We termed these chromosomal segments genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). After whole genome duplication in teleosts, GRBs, including HCNEs and target genes, were often maintained in both copies, while bystander genes were typically lost from one GRB, strongly suggesting that evolutionary pressure acts to keep the single-copy GRBs of higher vertebrates intact. We show that loss of bystander genes and other mutational events suffered by duplicated GRBs in teleost genomes permits target gene identification and HCNE/target gene assignment.

BACKGROUND All vertebrates share a remarkable degree of similarity in their development as well as in the basic functions of their cells. Despite this, attempts at unearthing genome-wide regulatory elements conserved throughout the vertebrate lineage using BLAST-like approaches have thus far detected noncoding conservation in only a few hundred genes, mostly associated with regulation of transcription and development. RESULTS We used a unique combination of tools to obtain regional global-local alignments of orthologous loci. This approach takes into account shuffling of regulatory regions that are likely to occur over evolutionary distances greater than those separating mammalian genomes. This approach revealed one order of magnitude more vertebrate conserved elements than was previously reported in over 2,000 genes, including a high number of genes found in the membrane and extracellular regions. Our analysis revealed that 72% of the elements identified have undergone shuffling. We tested the ability of the elements identified to enhance transcription in zebrafish embryos and compared their activity with a set of control fragments. We found that more than 80% of the elements tested were able to enhance transcription significantly, prevalently in a tissue-restricted manner corresponding to the expression domain of the neighboring gene. CONCLUSION Our work elucidates the importance of shuffling in the detection of cis-regulatory elements. It also elucidates how similarities across the vertebrate lineage, which go well beyond development, can be explained not only within the realm of coding genes but also in that of the sequences that ultimately govern their expression."

Two children, both with Down's syndrome, an atrioventricular canal defect, and reversible pulmonary hypertension (as assessed by an infusion of isoproterenol), had no decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance with enalaprilat. There were no adverse effects. Converting enzyme inhibitors may benefit \"heart failure\" associated with large ventricular septal defects and normal or mildly elevated pulmonary resistance."

Potassium chloride (KCl) supplementation is common among critically ill children. Intravenous (IV) KCl supplementation for pediatric patients is poorly characterized. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of IV KCL and to determine factors affecting patient responses to IV KCL in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). A retrospective review of 211 children (794 KCl doses) undergoing cardiac surgery or a hospital stay for heart failure in the CICU of a tertiary care teaching and referral children's hospital in 2011 was performed. Demographic data, weight, height, creatinine, and concomitant medications during each KCl dose were recorded and analyzed. Body surface area (BSA), creatinine clearance, and change in [K(+)] were calculated. The median age of the children was 4 months (range, 10 days-18 years). In this study, 151 KCl doses were administered to neonates (19 %), 307 doses (39 %) to females, and 510 doses (64 %) to patients with a BSA smaller than 0.33 m(2) (a group with relative renal insufficiency). The mean KCl dose was 0.97 \u00b1 0.006 mEq/kg. No adverse events were associated with IV KCl administration. Blood/plasma [K(+)] increased 0.8 \u00b1 0.02 mEq/L. The responses to KCl did not differ significantly between males and females, between neonates and children, or between patients with a BSA smaller than 0.33 m(2) and those with a BSA of 0.33 m(2) or larger. The responses to IV KCl were attenuated by concomitant furosemide (p = 0.01), amphotericin B (p < 0.01), and KCl in parenteral nutrition (p < 0.01). The responses were augmented by concomitant enalapril (p = 0.03), ethacrynic acid (p < 0.001), and hemodialysis (p < 0.01). Intravenous KCl can be administered safely for CICU patients. Responses to KCl are altered when it is given with certain medications. Intravenous KCl should be used cautiously in children receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Future studies are needed for further characterization of factors affecting responses to IV KCl in children."

BACKGROUND Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve exercise capacity in adults with congestive heart failure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance and improving ventricular diastolic function. Patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure have decreased cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, abnormal diastolic function, and decreased exercise capacity compared with normal people. METHODS AND RESULTS To test the hypothesis that afterload reduction therapy alters hemodynamic variables and augments exercise capacity in patients after a Fontan procedure, we compared the results of graded exercise with maximal effort from 18 subjects (14.5+/-6.2 years of age, 4 to 19 years after Fontan procedure) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial using enalapril (0.2 to 0.3 mg x kg[-1] x d[-1], maximum 15 mg). Each treatment was administered for 10 weeks. Diastolic filling patterns at rest were assessed by Doppler determination of the systemic atrioventricular valve flow velocity at the conclusion of each therapy. No difference was detected in resting heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac index. Diastolic filling patterns were also similar. Exercise duration was not different (6.4+/-2.6 [enalapril] versus 6.7+/-2.6 minutes [placebo]). The mean percent increase in cardiac index from rest to maximum exercise was slightly but significantly decreased in subjects after 10 weeks of enalapril therapy (102+/-34% [enalapril] versus 125+/-34% [placebo]; P<.02). At maximal exercise, cardiac index (3.5+/-0.9 [enalapril] versus 3.8+/-0.9 L x min[-1] x m2 [placebo]), oxygen consumption (18.3+/-9 [enalapril] versus 20.5+/-7 mL x min[-1] x kg[-1] [placebo]), minute ventilation (57.5+/-17 [enalapril] versus 55.4+/-19 L/min [placebo]), and total work (247+/-181 [enalapril] versus 261+/-197 W [placebo]) were not different. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that enalapril administration for 10 weeks does not alter abnormal systemic vascular resistance, resting cardiac index, diastolic function, or exercise capacity in patients who have undergone a Fontan procedure."

PURPOSE To determine whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, prevents cardiac function deterioration (defined using maximal cardiac index [MCI] on exercise testing or increase in left ventricular end-systolic wall stress [LVESWS]) in long-term survivors of pediatric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial comparing enalapril to placebo in 135 long-term survivors of pediatric cancer who had at least one cardiac abnormality identified at any time after anthracycline exposure. RESULTS There was no difference in the rate of change in MCI per year between enalapril and placebo groups (0.30 v 0.18 L/min/m(2); P =.55). However, during the first year of treatment, the rate of change in LVESWS was greater in the enalapril group than in the placebo group (-8.59 v 1.85 g/cm(2); P =.033) and this difference was maintained over the study period, resulting in a 9% reduction in estimated LVESWS by year 5 in the enalapril group. Six of seven patients removed from random assignment to treatment because of cardiac deterioration were initially treated with placebo (P =.11), and one has died as a result of heart failure. Side effects from enalapril included dizziness or hypotension (22% v 3% in the placebo group; P =.0003) and fatigue (10% v 0%; P =.013). CONCLUSION Enalapril treatment did not influence exercise performance, but did reduce LVESWS in the first year; this reduction was maintained over the study period. Any theoretical benefits of LVESWS reduction in this anthracycline-exposed population must be weighed against potential side effects from ACE inhibitors when making treatment decisions."

In 10% of subjects enalapril did not show any significant therapeutic effect. According to authors' opinion enalapril use is exceptionally profitable in the subjects surgically treated for complex heart malformations (Fontan operation). The beneficial effect was also found in majority of children suffering from congestive cardiomyopathy.

PURPOSE A common late effect of doxorubicin therapy for childhood cancer is reduced left-ventricular (LV) wall thickness resulting in elevated LV afterload and depressed LV function. Many children are given angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which have been studied primarily in adults. We document the long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in doxorubicin-treated survivors of childhood cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this retrospective study, we reviewed records of 18 children who had regular echocardiographic examinations during enalapril therapy (mean age at cancer diagnosis, 8 years; mean time between completion of doxorubicin therapy and start of enalapril, 7 years; median follow-up since the start of enalapril, 10 years). RESULTS Over the first 6 years of enalapril therapy, there was progressive improvement toward normal values in LV dimension, afterload, fractional shortening, and mass, but all these parameters deteriorated between 6 and 10 years. LV wall thickness deteriorated throughout the study period, as did LV contractility and systolic blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure fell slightly. By 6 years on enalapril, all six patients who had had congestive heart failure at the start of enalapril therapy had either died or undergone cardiac transplantation, compared with three of the 12 asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSION In doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer, enalapril-induced improvement in LV structure and function is transient. The primary defect, which is LV wall thinning, continues to deteriorate, and thus the short-term improvement was mostly related to lowered diastolic blood pressure."

Chromogranin A assays may have different sensitivities, which is of importance for the clinical diagnosis and handling of NET patients. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical sensitivities of three different CgA assays in NET patients. METHODS We measured CgA level in 42 NET patients (male/female: 23/19, median age: 63 years, range 29-85 years). Twenty-five patients had liver metastases, eight had local disease, and nine were disease free after surgery. We studied an in-house RIA: RH RIA assay (Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark); NEOLISATM (Euro Diagnostica, Malm\u00f6, Sweden) and EURIA CgA RIA (Euro Diagnostica, Malm\u00f6, Sweden). RESULTS The RH RIA assay showed a clinical sensitivity of 97%, while the NEOLISA and EURIA assays both showed similar clinical sensitivities of 79%. Patients with liver metastases had significantly higher CgA levels compared to disease free patients by all three assays (P<0.001), but only the RH RIA assay was able to discriminate between patients with liver metastases and with regional disease (P<0.01). CONCLUSION Chromogranin A measurements are significantly assay-dependent and caution should be applied in the interpretation of CgA measurement for assessment of NET status. The in-house RH RIA assay was better at predicting NET status than the NEOLISA and EURIA assays."

In the paraganglioma group, there were 8 men and 14 women between the ages of 23 and 79 years (mean, 46 years). Their symptoms depended on the location of the tumor and included neck swelling and Horner syndrome for neck tumors, whereas abdominal and chest pain was present in tumors of the abdomen and mediastinum, respectively.

Complete surgical resection was accomplished in all patients. The 46 neuroendocrine tumors were evaluated for GATA-3, pancytokeratin, thryoid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), napsin A, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin. All paragangliomas were universally positive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin, but negative for pancytokeratin, TTF-1, and napsin A. GATA-3 was expressed in 12 (55%) of 22 tumors.

In lean, chow-fed mice, IEC-IR deletion did not affect body or fat mass, plasma glucose, or IEC proliferation. In chow-fed VC-IR(\u0394/\u0394) mice, mRNA levels of the Paneth cell marker lysozyme (Lyz) were decreased, but markers of other differentiated lineages were unchanged. During HFD-induced obesity, IR(fl/fl) and VC-IR(\u0394/\u0394) mice exhibited similar increases in body and fat mass, plasma insulin, mRNAs encoding several lipid-handling proteins, a decrease in Paneth cell number, and impaired glucose tolerance.

Co-stored within the granule together with neuropeptideY, cardiac natriuretic peptide hormones, several prohormones and their proteolytic enzymes, CGA is a multifunctional protein and a major marker of the sympatho-adrenal neuroendocrine activity. Due to its partial processing to several biologically active peptides, CGA appears an important pro-hormone implicated in relevant modulatory actions on endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems through both direct and indirect sympatho-adrenergic interactions. As a part of this scenario, we here illustrate the emerging role exerted by the full-length CGA and its three derived fragments, i.e., Vasostatin 1, catestatin and serpinin, in the control of circulatory homeostasis with particular emphasis on their cardio-vascular actions under both physiological and physio-pathological conditions. The Vasostatin 1- and catestatin-induced cardiodepressive influences are achieved through anti-beta-adrenergic-NO-cGMP signaling, while serpinin acts like beta1-adrenergic agonist through AD-cAMP-independent NO signaling. On the whole, these actions contribute to widen our knowledge regarding the sympatho-chromaffin control of the cardiovascular system and its highly integrated \"whip-brake\" networks."

BACKGROUND Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are a group of rare tumors. Chromogranin A (CgA) was considered as the most practical and useful serum tumor marker in PNET patients. But peripheral blood levels of CgA are not routinely tested in Chinese patients with PNETs. This study was to assess the diagnostic value of CgA in Chinese patients with PNETs especially in patients with insulinomas. METHODS Eighty-nine patients with PNETs including 57 insulinomas and 32 non-insulinoma PNETs as well as 86 healthy participants were enrolled in this study between September 2003 and June 2013. Serum levels of CgA were measured by ELISA method. Expression of CgA protein was detected in 26 PNET tissues including 14 insulinomas by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS Serum levels of CgA in 89 PNET patients were significantly higher than that in healthy controls (P = 7.2 \u00d7 10-9). Serum levels of CgA in 57 patients with insulinomas (median 64.8 ng/ml, range 25-164) were slightly higher than the levels in healthy controls (median 53.4 ng/ml, range 39-94) but much lower than the levels in 32 patients with non-insulinoma PNETs (median 193 ng/ml, range 27-9021), P = 0.001. The serum CgA levels were reduced in 16 of 17 patients with insulinomas after tumor resection. ROC curve showed that CgA values at 60 ng/ml distinguished patients with insulinomas from healthy controls but its sensitivity and specificity were 66.7% and 73.3%, respectively. In contrast, CgA values at 74 ng/ml distinguished patients with non-insulinoma PNETs from healthy controls, and the sensitivity and specificity were 65.6% and 91.9%, respectively. Except for two insulinomas with negative staining of CgA, 12 insulinoma tissues showed positive staining of CgA. CONCLUSION CgA is a reliable serum diagnostic biomarker for PNETs but not for insulinomas."

Although chromogranin A (CGA) is a useful marker for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) in the West, its usefulness in Japanese populations is unclear. To assess this, we evaluated the serum CGA levels in 189 patients with various pancreatic diseases, including proven pNET (n = 69), pancreatic cancer (PC) (n = 50), chronic pancreatitis (CP) (n = 50) and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) (n = 20), and 112 normal controls (controls) using an ELISA kit. The mean CGA level of patients with pNET was significantly higher than any of the other groups (407.8 \u00b1 984.6 ng/mL [pNET] vs 91.8 \u00b1 101.8 ng/mL [PC], 93.6 \u00b1 57.5 ng/mL [CP], 69.9 \u00b1 52.4 ng/mL [AIP] and 62.5 \u00b1 48.3 ng/mL [controls]). Limiting the analysis to patients not using proton pump inhibitors (PPI), the CGA level of patients with PC or CP was not significantly different compared with the controls. Discriminant analysis revealed that the best cut-off value of CGA to distinguish patients with pNET from the controls was 78.7 ng/mL, with a sensitivity and specificity of 53.6% and 78.6%, respectively. In patients with pNET, significant factors associating with elevated CGA levels were tumor classification, tumor size, and the presence of liver metastases in univariate analysis as well as PPI use and the presence of liver metastases in multivariate analysis. We show that CGA is a useful marker for diagnosing pNET in Japanese populations and for distinguishing patients with pNET from patients with other pancreatic diseases. The increased use of CGA in Japan will likely be a helpful tool in managing these patients, as found in the West."

Chromogranin A (CgA) not only plays an important role in pathologic diagnosis, but is also used as a circulating biomarker in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm (GEP-NEN). However, the relationship between immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression and serum levels of CgA has not been investigated. The value of CgA for evaluating treatment response and prognosis is still not well understood. We conducted this study to assess the significance of CgA in GEP-NEN in terms of diagnosis, curative effects evaluation and prognosis. One hundred forty-five patients comprising 88 patients with active disease and 57 disease-free patients were enrolled in this study from January 2011 to November 2013. The expression of CgA was assessed by IHC, and serial serum CgA levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The overall expression rate of CgA was 69.0% (100/145). CgA expression was associated with tumor site and stage (P < 0.05), but not correlated with prognosis (P = 0.07). Serum CgA levels were significantly higher in GEP-NEN patients with active disease when compared with disease-free patients (P = 0.001) or healthy participants (P < 0.001). A CgA cutoff value of 95 ng/ml discriminated between healthy subjects or disease-free patients and patients with active disease (sensitivity 51.2% and specificity 87.5%, respectively). There was a correlation between the CgA IHC expression and high serum CgA levels (R = 0.320, P = 0.002). Serum CgA levels were much higher in patients who classified as neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed adenoendocrine carcinoma (P = 0.035) and who were on stage IV (P = 0.041). Changes in CgA levels normalization or \u2265 30% decrease suggested that patients had tumor response. Furthermore, patients with serum CgA levels higher than 95 ng/ml had a significantly shorter survival compared with patients with levels lower than 95 ng/ml (P < 0.001). CgA is a reliable pathologic and circulating maker for diagnosis of GEP-NEN. We further confirmed that serial measurement of CgA may be useful for evaluating the efficacy of different kinds of therapies in patients during follow-up, and serum CgA level \u2265 95 ng/ml may serve as a predictor of overall survial."

However, perturbation of its activity often leads to T cell leukemia. Whether and how its transcriptional activities are regulated during hematopoiesis remains to be addressed. Here, we show that TAL1 is associated with histone demethylase complexes containing lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), RE1 silencing transcription factor corepressor (CoREST), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and histone deacetylase 2 in erythroleukemia and T cell leukemia cells. The enzymatic domain of LSD1 plays an important role in repressing the TAL1-directed transcription of GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kniase minimal promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with the rapid changes of TAL1-corepressor complex during differentiation, TAL1 recruits LSD1 to the silenced p4.2 promoter in undifferentiated, but not in differentiated, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in MEL cells resulted in derepression of the TAL1 target gene accompanied by increasing dimeH3K4 at the promoter region. Thus, our data revealed that histone lysine demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate TAL1-mediated transcription and suggest that the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs."

However, the potential side effects of a LSD1-inhibitory therapy remain elusive. Here, we show, with a newly established conditional in vivo knockdown model, that LSD1 represents a central regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. LSD1 knockdown (LSD1-kd) expanded progenitor numbers by enhancing their proliferative behavior. LSD1-kd led to an extensive expansion of granulomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors. In contrast, terminal granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and platelet production were severely inhibited. The only exception was monopoiesis, which was promoted by LSD1 deficiency. Importantly, we showed that peripheral blood granulocytopenia, monocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were reversible after LSD1-kd termination. Extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis contributed to the phenotypic reversion, and progenitor populations remained expanded. LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b, Hoxa9 and Meis1, which are known regulators of the HSC/progenitor compartment. We also demonstrated that LSD1-kd abrogated Gfi1b-negative autoregulation by crossing LSD1-kd with Gfi1b:GFP mice. Taken together, our findings distinguish LSD1 as a critical regulator of hematopoiesis and point to severe, but reversible, side effects of a LSD1-targeted therapy."

Integrative genomic analysis, combining global occupancy of Lsd1, genome-wide analysis of its substrates H3K4 monomethylation and dimethylation, and gene expression profiling, reveals that Lsd1 represses hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene expression programs during hematopoietic differentiation. We found that Lsd1 acts at transcription start sites, as well as enhancer regions. Loss of Lsd1 was associated with increased H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 methylation on HSPC genes and gene derepression. Failure to fully silence HSPC genes compromised differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells as well as mature blood cell lineages. Collectively, our data indicate that Lsd1-mediated concurrent repression of enhancer and promoter activity of stem and progenitor cell genes is a pivotal epigenetic mechanism required for proper hematopoietic maturation.

TAL1/SCL is a hematopoietic-specific oncogene and its activity is regulated by associated transcriptional co-activators and corepressors. Dysregulation of TAL1 activity has been associated with T-cell leukemogenesis. However, it remains unclear how the interactions between TAL1 and corepressors versus co-activators are properly regulated. Here, we reported that protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation regulates TAL1 interaction with the lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1) that removes methyl group from methylated Lys 4 on histone H3 tails. Phosphorylation of serine 172 in TAL1 specifically destabilizes the TAL1-LSD1 interaction leading to promoter H3K4 hypermethylation and activation of target genes that have been suppressed in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Knockdown of TAL1 or LSD1 led to a derepression of the TAL1 target genes in T-cell acute lymphoblast leukemia (T-ALL) Jurkat cells, which is accompanied by elevating promoter H3K4 methylation. Similarly, treatment of PKA activator forskolin resulted in derepression of target genes by reducing its interaction with LSD1 while PKA inhibitor H89 represses them by suppressing H3K4 methylation levels. Consistent with the dual roles of TAL1 in transcription, TAL1-associated LSD1 is decreased while recruitment of hSET1 is increased at the TAL1 targets during erythroid differentiation. This process is accompanied by a dramatic increase in H3K4 methylation. Thus, our data revealed a novel interplay between PKA phosphorylation and TAL1-mediated epigenetic regulation that regulates hematopoietic transcription and differentiation programs during hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis."

A diverse number of possible functions have previously been ascribed to ASXL1 in non-hematopoietic contexts, including physical co-operativity with HP1a and LSD1. Here we discuss new evidence for a BAP1-independent function of ASXL1 in regulating histone H3 lysine 27 methylation through interactions with the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2). BAP1, a nuclear-localized deubiquitinase, has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, including ASXL1 and/or ASXL2, but the functional importance of this interaction has remained elusive. Here, we highlight recent work revealing the critical function of BAP1 in restricting myelopoiesis and in regulating hematopoietic stem cell function. These data provide evidence that BAP1 and ASXL1 function as a novel class of tumor suppressors in myeloid malignancies. BAP1 functions through effects on stability of host cell factor-1, and O-GlcNAcylation, and ASXL1 impacts histone post-translational modifications through interaction with PRC2.

The stem cell protein SALL4 plays a critical role in hematopoiesis by regulating the cell fate. In primitive hematopoietic precursors, it activates or represses important genes via recruitment of various epigenetic factors such as DNA methyltransferases, and histone deacylases. Here, we demonstrate that LSD1, a histone lysine demethylase, also participates in the trans-repressive effects of SALL4. Based on luciferase assays, the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 is important in suppressing SALL4-mediated reporter transcription. In freshly isolated adult mouse bone marrows, both SALL4 and LSD1 proteins are preferentially expressed in undifferentiated progenitor cells and co-localize in the nuclei. Further sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that these two factors share the same binding sites at the promoter regions of important hematopoietic regulatory genes including EBF1, GATA1, and TNF. In addition, studies from both gain- and loss-of-function models revealed that SALL4 dynamically controls the binding levels of LSD1, which is accompanied by a reversely changed histone 3 dimethylated lysine 4 at the same promoter regions. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in hematopoietic precursor cells resulted in altered SALL4 downstream gene expression and increased cellular activity. Thus, our data revealed that histone demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate SALL4-mediated transcription, and the dynamic regulation of SALL4-associated epigenetic factors cooperatively modulates early hematopoietic precursor proliferation."

Selective knock down of Gfi-1B p32 compromises erythroid differentiation, whereas its ectopic expression induces erythropoiesis in the absence of erythropoietin. Gfi-1B p32 isoform binds to Gfi-1B target gene promoters and associates with the LSD1-CoREST repressor complex more efficiently than the major Gfi-1B p37 isoform.

METHODS This was the first pregnancy of a 29-year-old woman. The pregnancy was uneventful until 27 weeks of gestation when left ventriculomegaly was first noted. At 31 weeks of gestation, polyhydramnios, macrocephaly, and ventriculomegaly were prominent on ultrasound, and left pyelectasis and bilateral ventriculomegaly were diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging.

Subtracting the symptoms of Sotos syndrome from the published patients with larger 5q35.3 deletions allowed us to delineate a distinct phenotype of prenatal lymphedema with increased nuchal translucency, pronounced muscular hypotonia and delay of reaching motor milestones, but speech development within normal limits, wide fontanels, failure to thrive with postnatal short stature, and multiple minor anomalies such as mildly bell-shaped chest, minor congenital heart disease, and a distinct facial gestalt, associated with the novel 3.5 Mb cryptic deletion. We further showed in our patient that the deletion of the LCT(4) synthase gene results in a reduction of cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis to about 65% compared to normal values. The prenatal nuchal lymphedema associated with this deletion syndrome my be related to the deletion of the FLT4 gene causing autosomal dominant primary lymphedema and contributes to the differential diagnosis of increased fetal nuchal translucency."

BACKGROUND Most cases of Sotos syndrome are caused by intragenic NSD1 mutations or 5q35 microdeletions. It is uncertain whether allelic or genetic heterogeneity underlies the residual cases and it has been proposed that other mechanisms, such as 11p15 defects, might be responsible for Sotos cases without NSD1 mutations or 5q35 microdeletions. OBJECTIVE To develop a multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay to screen NSD1 for exonic deletions/duplications. METHODS Analysis was undertaken of 18 classic Sotos syndrome cases in which NSD1 mutations and 5q35 microdeletions were excluded. Long range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to characterise the mechanism of generation of the partial NSD1 deletions. RESULTS Eight unique partial NSD1 deletions were identified: exons 1-2 (n = 4), exons 3-5, exons 9-13, exons 19-21, and exon 22. Using long range PCR six of the deletions were confirmed and the precise breakpoints in five cases characterised. This showed that three had arisen through Alu-Alu recombination and two from non-homologous end joining. CONCLUSIONS MLPA is a robust, inexpensive, simple technique that reliably detects both 5q35 microdeletions and partial NSD1 deletions that together account for approximately 15% of Sotos syndrome."

Haploinsufficiency of the nuclear receptor SET domain-containing protein 1 (NSD1) gene located on 5q35 has been implicated as the cause of Sotos syndrome. This study was performed to investigate the mutation spectrum of NSD1 abnormalities and meaningful genotype-phenotype correlations in Korean patients with Sotos syndrome.

Among them, eight patients (53%) had 5q35 microdeletions and the other seven patients (47%) had seven different NSD1 intragenic mutations including four novel mutations. The mutation spectrum of Korean patients with Sotos syndrome was similar to that of previous studies for Japanese patients.

BACKGROUND Sotos syndrome is characterised by learning difficulties, overgrowth, and a typical facial appearance. Microdeletions at 5q35.3, encompassing NSD1, are responsible for approximately 10% of non-Japanese cases of Sotos. In contrast, a recurrent approximately 2 Mb microdeletion has been reported as responsible for approximately 50% of Japanese cases of Sotos. METHODS We screened 471 cases for NSD1 mutations and deletions and identified 23 with 5q35 microdeletions. We investigated the deletion size, parent of origin, and mechanism of generation in these and a further 10 cases identified from published reports. We used \"in silico\" analyses to investigate whether repetitive elements that could generate microdeletions flank NSD1. RESULTS Three repetitive elements flanking NSD1, designated REPcen, REPmid, and REPtel, were identified. Up to 18 cases may have the same sized deletion, but at least eight unique deletion sizes were identified, ranging from 0.4 to 5 Mb. In most instances, the microdeletion arose through interchromosomal rearrangements of the paternally inherited chromosome. CONCLUSIONS Frequency, size, and mechanism of generation of 5q35 microdeletions differ between Japanese and non-Japanese cases of Sotos. Our microdeletions were identified from a large case series with a broad range of phenotypes, suggesting that sample selection variability is unlikely as a sole explanation for these differences and that variation in genomic architecture might be a contributory factor. Non-allelic homologous recombination between REPcen and REPtel may have generated up to 18 microdeletion cases in our series. However, at least 15 cannot be mediated by these repeats, including at least seven deletions of different sizes, implicating multiple mechanisms in the generation of 5q35 microdeletions."

CONTEXT Sotos syndrome is a rare genetic disorder with a distinct phenotypic spectrum including overgrowth and learning difficulties. Here we describe a new case of Sotos syndrome with a 5q35 microdeletion, affecting the fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) gene, presenting with infantile hypercalcemia. OBJECTIVE We strove to elucidate the evanescent nature of the observed hypercalcemia by studying the ontogenesis of FGFR3 and FGFR4, which are both associated with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23-mediated mineral homeostasis, in the developing human kidney. DESIGN Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses were used on archival human kidney samples to investigate the expression of the FGFR signaling pathway during renal development. RESULTS We demonstrated that renal gene and protein expression of both FGFRs increased during fetal development between the gestational ages (GAs) of 14-40 weeks. Yet FGFR4 expression increased more rapidly as compared with FGFR3 (slope 0.047 vs 0.0075, P = .0018). Moreover, gene and protein expression of the essential FGFR coreceptor, Klotho, also increased with a significant positive correlation between FGFR and Klotho mRNA expression during renal development. Interestingly, we found that perinatal FGFR4 expression (GA 38-40 wk) was 7-fold higher as compared with FGFR3 (P = .0035), whereas in adult kidney tissues, FGFR4 gene expression level was more than 2-fold lower compared with FGFR3 (P = .0029), thus identifying a molecular developmental switch of FGFR isoforms. CONCLUSION We propose that the heterozygous FGFR4 deletion, as observed in the Sotos syndrome patient, leads to a compromised FGF23 signaling during infancy accounting for transient hypercalcemia. These findings represent a novel and intriguing view on FGF23 mediated calcium homeostasis."

We investigated detailed craniofacial, dental, and oral findings in five patients with deletion type, and three patients with mutation type Sotos syndrome. All eight patients had a high palate, excessive tooth wear, crowding, and all but one patient had hypodontia and deep bite. Hypodontia was exclusively observed in the second premolars, and there were no differences between the deletion and mutation types in the number of missing teeth. Another feature frequently seen in common with both types was maxillary recession. Findings seen more frequently and more pronounced in deletion-type than in mutation-type included mandibular recession, scissors or posterior cross bite, and small dental arch with labioclination of the maxillary central incisors. It is noteworthy that although either scissors bite or cross bite was present in all of the deletion-type patients, neither of these was observed in mutation-type patients. Other features seen in a few patients include enamel hypoplasia (two deletion patients), and ectopic tooth eruption (one deletion and one mutation patients).

OBJECTIVE Associations between metabolic syndrome and its individual components with risk of incident dementia and its different subtypes are inconsistent. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The 7,087 community-dwelling subjects aged > or =65 years were recruited from the French Three-City (3C) cohort. Hazard ratios (over 4 years) of incident dementia and its subtypes (vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease) and association with metabolic syndrome (defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) and its individual components (hypertension, large waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and elevated fasting glycemia) were estimated in separate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS Metabolic syndrome was present in 15.8% of the study participants. The presence of metabolic syndrome increased the risk of incident vascular dementia but not Alzheimer's disease over 4 years, independent of sociodemographic characteristics and the apolipoprotein (apo) Eepsilon4 allele. High triglyceride level was the only component of metabolic syndrome that was significantly associated with the incidence of all-cause (hazard ratio 1.45 [95% CI 1.05-2.00]; P = 0.02) and vascular (2.27 [1.16-4.42]; P = 0.02) dementia, even after adjustment of the apoE genotype.

CONCLUSIONS The observed relation between high triglycerides, diabetes, and vascular dementia emphasizes the need for detection and treatment of vascular risk factors in older individuals in order to prevent the likelihood of clinical dementia."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW The prevalence of obesity is on the increase, and consequently metabolic syndrome is also becoming a serious health problem in children and adolescents all over the world. This review attempts to summarize the recent literature on metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS To date, a standard definition of metabolic syndrome for the pediatric population is not available. Recently, the International Diabetes Federation has proposed a new set of criteria to define metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents aged 6-16 years. The relationships between obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome may be explained by the pattern of lipid partitioning. Fatty liver plays a central role in the insulin-resistant state in obese adolescents. Although insulin resistance has been proposed as the central factor leading to the abnormalities observed in metabolic syndrome, most definitions of metabolic syndrome use impaired fasting glucose as a marker. Nutrition impairment during both prenatal and early postnatal life can cause metabolic disturbances leading to insulin-resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. SUMMARY Metabolic syndrome prevalence in children and adolescents is on the increase. Therefore, the emphasis in all studies and programs related to metabolic syndrome should be focused on prevention, early detection of metabolic risk factors and interventions that will have a significant impact on future adult health."

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) has been widely used as a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). CIMT in women with PCOS has been investigated in many studies, but there has been only one report in the Korean population. The aim of the present study was to compare the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in young untreated Korean women with PCOS and age-matched controls, specifically by measuring their CIMT. METHODS CIMT was measured by one radiologist in 56 PCOS patients and 56 controls. To compare the CIMT according to PCOS phenotypes, women with PCOS were divided into two subgroups according to the presence of hyperandrogenism. RESULTS Although PCOS patients were more obese and had higher blood pressure and insulin resistance index than the age-matched controls, the CIMT was not different between the two groups (0.49 \u00b1 0.09 mm in PCOS patients vs. 0.50 \u00b1 0.11 mm in controls, respectively, p = 0.562). When the CIMT in the control group was compared with hyperandrogenic and non-hyperandrogenic PCOS groups, also no significant differences were found. CONCLUSION Despite the significant differences in some vascular risk factors between women with PCOS and controls, PCOS patients did not have a significantly higher CIMT (even in the hyperandrogenic subgroups).

SCM consists of 4 different types; So-Eum (SE), So-Yang (SY), Tae-Eum (TE), and Tae-Yang (TY). In Western medicine, it is more like stratifying individuals according to phenotypic expression. It is of great importance that the Sasang constitution type be evaluated accurately and recognized by the medical communities for prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). SUBJECTS AND METHODS From the Ansung-Ansan prospective cohort study, 10,038 participants were recruited from years 2001-2002. Of 10,038 original participants, 3022 subjects underwent Sasang Constitutional Type (SCT) evaluation. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to predict CVD during the ten year follow-up period. RESULTS Of 3022 participants, SCT classified into 364 (12%) SE, 1053 (34.8%) SY, 1605 (53.1%) TE, and no TY. Three hundred seventy nine (16%) newly developed CVD during the following period, yielding 10-year cumulative incidence of 160/1000 person. The frequency of CVD within three SCT without metabolic syndrome (MetS) shows 13.4% in SE, 13.6% in SY, and 14.3% in TE, respectively (p=NS). The CVD events were significantly different among the types when MetS was present. The demographic and clinical characteristics revealed the TE group was significantly older, more obese, higher blood pressure, glucose values, and lipid profiles levels. The frequency of MetS and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was also higher in TE type than either SE and SY types (all p<0.001). The Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed age, female gender, rural residence, higher ALT level, and lower beta-cell function remain as an independent risk factor, as well as SY with MetS (RR=1.838 (95% CI 1.23-2.74), p=0.003). Furthermore, 10 year CVD survival rate was 86.4% in no MetS group, 83.4% in TE, 79.6% in SE, and 76.4% in SY all with MetS (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The findings from this study suggest MetS increases risk for CVD in certain physical conditions like SY type. Therefore, we would like to suggest that SCT is a strong indicator for CVD."

Great progress has been made over the past years in elucidating the structure and function of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins, most of which are now actively being pursued as antiviral targets. The structural proteins, which form the viral particle, include the core protein and the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. The nonstructural proteins include the p7 viroporin, the NS2 protease, the NS3-4A complex harboring protease and NTPase/RNA helicase activities, the NS4B and NS5A proteins, and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. NS4B is a master organizer of replication complex formation while NS5A is a zinc-containing phosphoprotein involved in the regulation of HCV RNA replication versus particle production. Core to NS2 make up the assembly module while NS3 to NS5B represent the replication module (replicase). However, HCV proteins exert multiple functions during the viral life cycle, and these may be governed by different structural conformations and/or interactions with viral and/or cellular partners. Remarkably, each viral protein is anchored to intracellular membranes via specific determinants that are essential to protein function in the cell. This review summarizes current knowledge of the structure and function of the HCV proteins and highlights recent advances in the field."

The anti-NS3 IgG, 3F8, binds a conserved epitope (aa526-531) in the NS3 helicase domain, and cross-reacts with NS3 from all four DENV serotypes and the related yellow fever virus. The anti-NS2B IgG, 3F10, binds aa49-66 of NS2B (CF18), which forms part of the 47 aa hydrophilic cofactor region required for NS3 protease activity. The specificity of the IgG for their respective non-structural proteins has been demonstrated by immunofluorescence of cells infected with DENV and Western blotting. 3F8 is able to co-immunoprecipitate NS3 and NS5 from BHK-21 cells infected with DENV2, and 3F10 is able to detect an interaction between recombinant NS2B(CF18)NS3 full-length protein and the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain in an ELISA-based binding assay. The assay is specific and highly reproducible, with a clear binding curve seen when RdRp is incubated with increasing amounts of full-length NS3, but not the NS3 protease domain. The NS3 helicase domain competes with NS3 full-length for NS5 RdRp binding, with a K(d.) of 2.5\u03bcM.

Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (P-PMOs) were used to further dissect the role of conserved regions of the 5' and 3' UTRs; several P-PMOs were shown to specifically inhibit DENV translation and/or RNA synthesis and, hence, are potentially useful as antiviral agents.

Dengue virus type 2 (DEN2), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is a re-emerging human pathogen of global significance. DEN2 nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) has a serine protease domain (NS3-pro) and requires the hydrophilic domain of NS2B (NS2BH) for activation. NS3 is also an RNA-stimulated nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase)/RNA helicase and a 5'-RNA triphosphatase (RTPase). In this study the first biochemical and kinetic properties of full-length NS3 (NS3FL)-associated NTPase, RTPase, and RNA helicase are presented. The NS3FL showed an enhanced RNA helicase activity compared with the NS3-pro-minus NS3, which was further enhanced by the presence of the NS2BH (NS2BH-NS3FL). An active protease catalytic triad is not required for the stimulatory effect, suggesting that the overall folding of the N-terminal protease domain contributes to this enhancement. In DEN2-infected mammalian cells, NS3 and NS5, the viral 5'-RNA methyltransferase/polymerase, exist as a complex. Therefore, the effect of NS5 on the NS3 NTPase activity was examined. The results show that NS5 stimulated the NS3 NTPase and RTPase activities. The NS5 stimulation of NS3 NTPase was dose-dependent until an equimolar ratio was reached. Moreover, the conserved motif, 184RKRK, of NS3 played a crucial role in binding to RNA substrate and modulating the NTPase/RNA helicase and RTPase activities of NS3."

OBJECTIVE Functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) is known to be reduced in patients with disorders of consciousness, to a different extent depending on their clinical severity. Nevertheless, the integrity of the structural architecture supporting this network and its relation with the exhibited functional disconnections are very poorly understood. We investigated the structural connectivity and white matter integrity of the DMN in patients with disorders of consciousness of varying clinical severity. METHODS Fifty-two patients--19 in a vegetative state (VS), 27 in a minimally conscious state (MCS), and 6 emerging from a minimally conscious state (EMCS)--and 23 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Structural connectivity was assessed by means of probabilistic tractography, and the integrity of the resulting fibers was characterized by their mean fractional anisotropy values. RESULTS Patients showed significant impairments in all of the pathways connecting cortical regions within this network, as well as the pathway connecting the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus with the thalamus, relative to the healthy volunteers. Moreover, the structural integrity of this pathway, as well as that of those connecting the posterior areas of the network, was correlated with the patients' behavioral signs for awareness, being higher in EMCS patients than those in the upper and lower ranges of the MCS patients, and lowest in VS patients.

The default mode network (DMN) has been consistently activated across a wide variety of self-related tasks, leading to a proposal of the DMN's role in self-related processing. Indeed, there is limited fMRI evidence that the functional connectivity within the DMN may underlie a phenomenon referred to as self-awareness. At the same time, none of the known studies have explicitly investigated neuronal functional interactions among brain areas that comprise the DMN as a function of self-consciousness loss. To fill this gap, EEG operational synchrony analysis [1, 2] was performed in patients with severe brain injuries in vegetative and minimally conscious states to study the strength of DMN operational synchrony as a function of self-consciousness expression. We demonstrated that the strength of DMN EEG operational synchrony was smallest or even absent in patients in vegetative state, intermediate in patients in minimally conscious state and highest in healthy fully self-conscious subjects. At the same time the process of ecoupling of operations performed by neuronal assemblies that comprise the DMN was highest in patients in vegetative state, intermediate in patients in minimally conscious state and minimal in healthy fully self-conscious subjects. The DMN's frontal EEG operational module had the strongest decrease in operational synchrony strength as a function of selfconsciousness loss, when compared with the DMN's posterior modules. Based on these results it is suggested that the strength of DMN functional connectivity could mediate the strength of self-consciousness expression. The observed alterations similarly occurred across EEG alpha, beta1 and beta2 frequency oscillations. Presented results suggest that the EEG operational synchrony within DMN may provide an objective and accurate measure for the assessment of signs of self-(un)consciousness in these challenging patient populations. This method therefore, may complement the current diagnostic procedures for patients with severe brain injuries and, hence, the planning of a rational rehabilitation intervention."

Forty-one cirrhotic patients (16 without HE, 14 minimal HE, 11 overt HE) and 32 healthy controls were assessed. The HE grade in cirrhotic patients was evaluated by the West Haven criteria and neuro-psychological examinations. Functional connectivity correlation coefficient (fc-CC) of the default mode network (DMN) was determined by rs-fMRI, while the corresponding mean diffusivity (MD) was obtained from DTI. Correlations among inter-cortical fc-CC, DTI indices, Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument scores, and laboratory tests were also analyzed. Results showed that gradual reductions of HE-related consciousness levels, from \"without HE\" or \"minimal HE\" to \"overt HE\", correlated with decreased anterior-posterior fc-CC in DMN [F(4.415), p = 0.000)]. The MD values from regions with anterior-posterior fc-CC differences in DMN revealed significant differences between the overt HE group and other groups. Increased MD in this network was inversely associated with decreased fc-CC in DMN and linearly correlated with poor cognitive performance. In conclusion, cerebral edema can be linked to altered cerebral temporal architecture that modifies both within- and between-network connectivity in HE. Reduced fc-CC in DMN is associated with behavior and consciousness deterioration.

Functional neuroimaging studies have shown preserved albeit disconnected low-level cortical activation in response to external stimulation in patients in a \"vegetative state\" or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome. While activation of these \"primary\" sensory cortices does not necessarily reflect conscious awareness, activation in higher-order associative cortices in minimally conscious state patients seems to herald some residual perceptual awareness. PET studies have identified a metabolic dysfunction in a widespread frontoparietal \"global neuronal workspace\" in DOC patients including the midline default mode network (\"intrinsic\" system) and the lateral frontoparietal cortices or \"extrinsic system.\" Recent studies have investigated the relation of awareness to the functional connectivity within intrinsic and extrinsic networks, and with the thalami in both pathological and pharmacological coma. In brain damaged patients, connectivity in all default network areas was found to be non-linearly correlated with the degree of clinical consciousness impairment, ranging from healthy controls and locked-in syndrome to minimally conscious, vegetative, coma, and brain dead patients. Anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness was also shown to correlate with a global decrease in cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity in both intrinsic and extrinsic networks, but not in auditory, or visual networks. In anesthesia, unconsciousness was also associated with a loss of cross-modal interactions between networks. These results suggest that conscious awareness critically depends on the functional integrity of thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical frontoparietal connectivity within and between \"intrinsic\" and \"extrinsic\" brain networks."

Previous studies investigating resting state networks demonstrate that 2 main features of the so-called default mode network (DMN), metabolism and functional connectivity, are impaired in patients with a disorder of consciousness. However, task-induced deactivation--a third main feature of the DMN--has not been explored in a group of patients. Deactivation of the DMN is supposed to reflect interruptions of introspective processes. Seventeen patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS, former vegetative state), 8 patients in minimally conscious state (MCS), and 25 healthy controls were investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a passive sentence listening task. Results show that deactivation in medial regions is reduced in MCS and absent in UWS patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, behavioral scores assessing the level of consciousness correlate with deactivation in patients. On single-subject level, all control subjects but only 2 patients in MCS and 6 with UWS exposed deactivation. Interestingly, all patients who deactivated during speech processing (except for one) showed activation in left frontal regions which are associated with conscious processing. Our results indicate that deactivation of the DMN can be associated with the level of consciousness by selecting those who are able to interrupt ongoing introspective processes.

OBJECTIVE Resting-state networks (RSNs), including the default mode network (DMN), have been considered as markers of brain status such as consciousness, developmental change, and treatment effects. The consistency of functional connectivity among RSNs has not been fully explored, especially among resting-state-related independent components (RSICs). MATERIALS AND METHODS This resting-state fMRI study addressed the consistency of functional connectivity among RSICs as well as their spatial consistency between 'at day 1' and 'after 4 weeks' in 13 healthy volunteers. RESULTS We found that most RSICs, especially the DMN, are reproducible across time, whereas some RSICs were variable in either their spatial characteristics or their functional connectivity. Relatively low spatial consistency was found in the basal ganglia, a parietal region of left frontoparietal network, and the supplementary motor area. The functional connectivity between two independent components, the bilateral angular/supramarginal gyri/intraparietal lobule and bilateral middle temporal/occipital gyri, was decreased across time regardless of the correlation analysis method employed, (Pearson's or partial correlation). CONCLUSION RSICs showing variable consistency are different between spatial characteristics and functional connectivity. To understand the brain as a dynamic network, we recommend further investigation of both changes in the activation of specific regions and the modulation of functional connectivity in the brain network."

HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infects CD4(+) T lymphocytes and tissue macrophages. Infected macrophages differ from T cells in terms of decreased to absent cytopathicity and for active accumulation of new progeny HIV-1 virions in virus-containing compartments (VCC). For these reasons, infected macrophages are believed to act as \"Trojan horses\" carrying infectious particles to be released on cell necrosis or functional stimulation. Here we explored the hypothesis that extracellular ATP (eATP) could represent a microenvironmental signal potentially affecting virion release from VCC of infected macrophages. Indeed, eATP triggered the rapid release of infectious HIV-1 from primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) acutely infected with the CCR5-dependent HIV-1 strain. A similar phenomenon was observed in chronically infected promonocytic U1 cells differentiated to macrophage-like cells (D-U1) by costimulation with phorbol esters and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Worthy of note, eATP did not cause necrotic, apoptotic, or pyroptotic cell death, and its effect on HIV-1 release was suppressed by Imipramine (an antidepressant agent known to inhibit microvesicle formation by interfering with membrane-associated acid sphingomyelinase). Virion release was not triggered by oxidized ATP, whereas the effect of eATP was inhibited by a specific inhibitor of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R). Thus, eATP triggered the discharge of virions actively accumulating in VCC of infected macrophages via interaction with the P2X7R in the absence of significant cytopathicity. These findings suggest that the microvesicle pathway and P2X7R could represent exploitable targets for interfering with the VCC-associated reservoir of infectious HIV-1 virions in tissue macrophages."

The macrophage NLRC4 inflammasome drives potent innate immune responses against Salmonella by eliciting caspase-1-dependent proinflammatory cytokine production (e.g., interleukin-1\u03b2 [IL-1\u03b2]) and pyroptotic cell death. However, the potential contribution of other cell types to inflammasome-mediated host defense against Salmonella was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that neutrophils, typically viewed as cellular targets of IL-1\u03b2, themselves activate the NLRC4 inflammasome during acute Salmonella infection and are a major cell compartment for IL-1\u03b2 production during acute peritoneal challenge in vivo. Importantly, unlike macrophages, neutrophils do not undergo pyroptosis upon NLRC4 inflammasome activation. The resistance of neutrophils to pyroptotic death is unique among inflammasome-signaling cells so far described and allows neutrophils to sustain IL-1\u03b2 production at a site of infection without compromising the crucial inflammasome-independent antimicrobial effector functions that would be lost if neutrophils rapidly lysed upon caspase-1 activation. Inflammasome pathway modification in neutrophils thus maximizes host proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses during pathogen challenge."

The fungal pathogen Candida albicans causes macrophage death and escapes, but the molecular mechanisms remained unknown. Here we used live-cell imaging to monitor the interaction of C. albicans with macrophages and show that C. albicans kills macrophages in two temporally and mechanistically distinct phases. Early upon phagocytosis, C. albicans triggers pyroptosis, a proinflammatory macrophage death. Pyroptosis is controlled by the developmental yeast-to-hypha transition of Candida. When pyroptosis is inactivated, wild-type C. albicans hyphae cause significantly less macrophage killing for up to 8 h postphagocytosis. After the first 8 h, a second macrophage-killing phase is initiated. This second phase depends on robust hyphal formation but is mechanistically distinct from pyroptosis. The transcriptional regulator Mediator is necessary for morphogenesis of C. albicans in macrophages and the establishment of the wild-type surface architecture of hyphae that together mediate activation of macrophage cell death. Our data suggest that the defects of the Mediator mutants in causing macrophage death are caused, at least in part, by reduced activation of pyroptosis. A Mediator mutant that forms hyphae of apparently wild-type morphology but is defective in triggering early macrophage death shows a breakdown of cell surface architecture and reduced exposed 1,3 \u03b2-glucan in hyphae. Our report shows how Candida uses host and pathogen pathways for macrophage killing. The current model of mechanical piercing of macrophages by C. albicans hyphae should be revised to include activation of pyroptosis by hyphae as an important mechanism mediating macrophage cell death upon C. albicans infection. IMPORTANCE Upon phagocytosis by macrophages, Candida albicans can transition to the hyphal form, which causes macrophage death and enables fungal escape. The current model is that the highly polarized growth of hyphae results in macrophage piercing. This model is challenged by recent reports of C. albicans mutants that form hyphae of wild-type morphology but are defective in killing macrophages. We show that C. albicans causes macrophage cell death by at least two mechanisms. Phase 1 killing (first 6 to 8 h) depends on the activation of the pyroptotic programmed host cell death by fungal hyphae. Phase 2 (up to 24 h) is rapid and depends on robust hyphal formation but is independent of pyroptosis. Our data provide a new model for how the interplay between fungal morphogenesis and activation of a host cell death pathway mediates macrophage killing by C. albicans hyphae."

Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a common cardiac condition in patients with diabetes mellitus, which can result in cardiac hypertrophy and subsequent heart failure, associated with pyroptosis, the pro-inflammatory programmed cell death. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small endogenous non-coding RNAs, have been shown to be involved in diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, whether miRNAs regulate pyroptosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy remains unknown. Our study revealed that mir-30d expression was substantially increased in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and in high-glucose-treated cardiomyocytes as well. Upregulation of mir-30d promoted cardiomyocyte pyroptosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy; conversely, knockdown of mir-30d attenuated it. In an effort to understand the signaling mechanisms underlying the pro-pyroptotic property of mir-30d, we found that forced expression of mir-30d upregulated caspase-1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Moreover, mir-30d directly repressed foxo3a expression and its downstream protein, apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC). Furthermore, silencing ARC by siRNA mimicked the action of mir-30d: upregulating caspase-1 and inducing pyroptosis. These findings promoted us to propose a new signaling pathway leading to cardiomyocyte pyroptosis under hyperglycemic conditions: mir-30d\u2191\u2192foxo3a\u2193\u2192 ARC\u2193\u2192caspase-1\u2191\u2192IL-1\u03b2, IL-18\u2191\u2192pyroptosis\u2191.

Pyroptosis is an inflammasome-mediated programmed cell death pathway triggered in macrophages by a variety of stimuli, including intracellular bacterial pathogens. Activation of pyroptosis leads to the secretion of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and pore-mediated cell lysis. Although not considered an intracellular pathogen, Candida albicans is able to kill and, thereby, escape from macrophages. Here, we show that C. albicans-infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and murine J774 macrophages undergo pyroptotic cell death that is suppressed by glycine and pharmacologic inhibition of caspase-1. Infection of BMDM harvested from mice lacking components of the inflammasome revealed that pyroptosis was dependent on caspase-1, ASC, and NLRP3 and independent of NLRC4. In contrast to its role during intracellular bacterial infection, pyroptosis does not restrict C. albicans replication. Nonfilamentous Candida spp. did not trigger pyroptosis, while Candida krusei, which forms pseudohyphae in macrophages, triggered much lower levels than did C. albicans. Interestingly, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain from the filamentous background \u03a31278 also triggered low, but significant, levels of pyroptosis. We have found that deletion of the transcription factor UPC2 decreases pyroptosis but has little effect on filamentation in the macrophage. In addition, a gain-of-function mutant of UPC2 induces higher levels of pyroptosis than does a matched control strain. Taken together, these data are most consistent with a model in which filamentation is necessary but not sufficient to trigger NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. This is the first example of a fungal pathogen triggering pyroptosis and indicates that C. albicans-mediated macrophage damage is not solely due to hypha-induced physical disruption of cellular integrity."

To test this, the immune recognition of recombinant flagellins derived from pathogenic Salmonella Typhi (SF) and the nonpathogenic Escherichia coli K12 strain MG1655 (KF) were examined by the activation of TLR5 and NLRC4 pathways in various cell types. While flagellins SF and KF were not distinguishable in activating the TLR5 pathway, KF induced significantly less interleukin-1\u03b2 production and pyroptotic cell death in peritoneal macrophages than SF, and showed markedly lower efficiency in activating caspase-1 through the NLRC4 pathway than SF. Macrophages may differentially recognize flagellins by intracellular sensors and thereby initiate the immune response to invading pathogenic bacteria.

Although infection with wild-type Salmonella typhimurium is lethal to mice, we show here that a strain that persistently expresses flagellin was cleared by the cytosolic flagellin-detection pathway through the activation of caspase-1 by the NLRC4 inflammasome; however, this clearance was independent of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Instead, caspase-1-induced pyroptotic cell death released bacteria from macrophages and exposed the bacteria to uptake and killing by reactive oxygen species in neutrophils. Similarly, activation of caspase-1 cleared unmanipulated Legionella pneumophila and Burkholderia thailandensis by cytokine-independent mechanisms. This demonstrates that activation of caspase-1 clears intracellular bacteria in vivo independently of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and establishes pyroptosis as an efficient mechanism of bacterial clearance by the innate immune system."

METHODS Using previously described methods, a protocol was developed for a meta-analysis examining the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and subsequent development of primary brain tumors in their offspring. Literature search techniques, study inclusion criteria and statistical procedures were prospectively defined. Data from epidemiological studies were pooled using a general variance-based meta-analytic method employing confidence intervals previously described by Greenland.

Sensitivity analyses were performed when necessary to explain any observed statistical heterogeneity and/or to evaluate the impact of demographic or study characteristics on the summary estimate of effect. RESULTS Twelve observational studies meeting protocol specified inclusion criteria were obtained via a comprehensive literature search. These studies enrolled a total of 6566 patients.

Surveillance of Environmental Aspects Related to Cancer in Humans. The etiology of childhood brain tumors (CBTs) remains unknown. Tobacco smoke contains several known carcinogens and can induce DNA adducts in human placenta and hemoglobin adducts in fetuses. We present the results of an international case-control study to evaluate the association between CBTs and exposure of parents and children to cigarette smoke. The study was undertaken as part of the SEARCH program of the IARC. Nine centers in 7 countries were involved. The studies mainly covered the 1980s and early 1990s. Cases (1,218, ages 0-19 years) were children newly diagnosed with a primary brain tumor; there were 2,223 population-based controls. Most mothers who agreed to participate were interviewed in person at home. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex and center, for all types of CBT combined, 4 CBT histotypes, 5 age groups and each center. There was no association between the risk of brain tumors in the child and parental smoking prior to pregnancy, maternal smoking or regular exposure to others' cigarette smoke during pregnancy at home or at work, or passive smoking by the child during the first year of life. These results did not change considering the child's age at diagnosis, the histologic type of tumor or center."

BACKGROUND From 1993 to 1997 we conducted two population-based case-control studies on childhood cancer and a variety of potential risk factors in Germany. One case group involved children under the age of 15 years having a tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). PROCEDURE For both studies, one conducted in the northwestern area of Germany, the other covering the whole of West Germany, incident cases were identified from the nationwide German Childhood Cancer Registry, and controls were randomly selected from complete population registration files. RESULTS In total 466 pediatric CNS tumor cases and 2,458 controls were available for analyses. We observed only few positive associations, namely, between CNS tumors and low birth weight [<2,500 g; odds ratio (OR), 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-2.84], between ependymoma and maternal smoking during pregnancy (>10 cigarettes per day: OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.69-13.1), and between astrocytoma and exposure to wood preservatives (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.22-3.01). CNS tumors were not associated with high birth weight, duration of breast feeding, maternal age at time of delivery, duration of gestation, previous fetal losses, paternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal alcohol consumption, the child's exposure to pesticides, maternal diagnostic X-ray examinations during pregnancy, X-ray examinations of the child, or exposure to residential magnetic fields. CONCLUSIONS Despite the large study population, we found only few factors that were associated with CNS tumors or one of the morphological subgroups. Therefore, our results suggest that aspects of the prenatal and neonatal period play only a minor role in the etiology of pediatric CNS tumors."

The results of the meta-analyses suggest a small increase in risk of all neoplasms [relative risk (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.19; based on 12 studies], but not of specific neoplasms such as leukemia (RR 1.05; CI, 0.82-1.34; 8 studies) and central nervous system tumors (RR 1.04; CI, 0.92-1. 18; 12 studies). Results for other specific neoplasms were sparse, but the available data did not suggest a strong association for any type of tumor. No clear evidence of dose response was present in the studies that addressed this issue. The results on exposure to maternal tobacco smoke before or after pregnancy are too sparse to allow a conclusion. The results on exposure to paternal tobacco smoke suggest an association with brain tumors (RR 1.22; CI, 1.05-1. 40; based on 10 studies) and lymphomas (RR 2.08; CI, 1.08-3.98; 4 studies).

Further studies are needed to confirm the hypothesis that parental tobacco smoke, from the father in particular, is a risk factor of childhood cancer. Results on the risk of lung cancer in adulthood and childhood passive smoking exposure are available from 11 studies: they do not provide evidence of an increased risk (summary RR 0.91; CI, 0.80-1.05)."

TSLP requires a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of IL-7 receptor \u03b1 subunit and its unique TSLP receptor (gene symbol CRLF2) to transmit signals in cells. Abnormal TSLP signaling (e.g. overexpression of TSLP or its unique receptor TSLPR) contributes to the development of a number of diseases including asthma and leukemia. However, a detailed understanding of the signaling pathways activated by TSLP remains elusive. In this study, we performed a global quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of the TSLP signaling network using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture. By employing titanium dioxide in addition to antiphosphotyrosine antibodies as enrichment methods, we identified 4164 phosphopeptides on 1670 phosphoproteins. Using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-based quantitation, we determined that the phosphorylation status of 226 proteins was modulated by TSLP stimulation. Our analysis identified activation of several members of the Src and Tec families of kinases including Btk, Lyn, and Tec by TSLP for the first time. In addition, we report TSLP-induced phosphorylation of protein phosphatases such as Ptpn6 (SHP-1) and Ptpn11 (Shp2), which has also not been reported previously. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Shp2 binds to the adapter protein Gab2 in a TSLP-dependent manner. This is the first demonstration of an inducible protein complex in TSLP signaling. A kinase inhibitor screen revealed that pharmacological inhibition of PI-3 kinase, Jak family kinases, Src family kinases or Btk suppressed TSLP-dependent cellular proliferation making them candidate therapeutic targets in diseases resulting from aberrant TSLP signaling. Our study is the first phosphoproteomic analysis of the TSLP signaling pathway that greatly expands our understanding of TSLP signaling and provides novel therapeutic targets for TSLP/TSLPR-associated diseases in humans."

Recent advances in MS instrumentation and progresses in phosphopeptide enrichment, in conjunction with more powerful data analysis tools, have facilitated unbiased characterization of thousands of site-specific phosphorylation events. Combined with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture metabolic labeling, these techniques have made it possible to quantitatively evaluate phosphorylation changes in various physiological states in stable cell lines. However, quantitative phosphoproteomics in primary cells and tissues remains a major technical challenge due to the lack of adequate techniques for accurate quantification. Here, we describe an integrated strategy allowing for large scale quantitative profiling of phosphopeptides in complex biological mixtures. In this technique, the mixture of proteolytic peptides was subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment using a titania affinity column, and the purified phosphopeptides were subsequently labeled with iTRAQ reagents. After further fractionation by strong-cation exchange, the peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer, which collects CID and high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) spectra sequentially for peptide identification and quantitation. We demonstrate that direct phosphopeptide enrichment of protein digests by titania affinity chromatography substantially improves the efficiency and reproducibility of phosphopeptide proteomic analysis and is compatible with downstream iTRAQ labeling. Conditions were optimized for HCD normalized collision energy to balance the overall peptide identification and quantitation using the relative abundances of iTRAQ reporter ions. Using this approach, we were able to identify 3557 distinct phosphopeptides from HeLa cell lysates, of which 2709 were also quantified from HCD scans."

We used SILAC-based quantitative MS to measure differences in protein expression and phosphorylation upon ablation of the serine/threonine phosphatase Ppt1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Phosphopeptide fractionation by strong cation exchange chromatography combined with immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) enrichment enabled quantification of more than 8000 distinct phosphorylation sites in Ppt1 wild-type versus Ppt1-deficient yeast cells. We further quantified the relative expression of 1897 yeast proteins and detected no major protein changes accompanying Ppt1 deficiency. Notably, we found 33 phosphorylation sites to be significantly and reproducibly up-regulated while no phosphorylation events were repressed in cells lacking Ppt1. Ppt1 acted on its cellular target proteins in a sequence- and site-specific fashion. Several of the regulated phosphoproteins were involved in the response to heat stress in agreement with known Ppt1 functions. Additionally, biosynthetic enzymes were particularly prominent among Ppt1-regulated phosphoproteins, pointing to unappreciated roles of Ppt1 in the control of various metabolic functions.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We investigated the differential phosphoproteome upon proteasome inhibition by using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with phosphoprotein enrichment and LC-MS/MS analysis. In total 233 phosphoproteins were identified and 72 phosphoproteins showed a 1.5-fold or greater change upon bortezomib treatment. The phosphoproteins with expression alterations encompass all major protein classes, including a large number of nucleic acid binding proteins. Site-specific phosphopeptide quantitation revealed that Ser38 phosphorylation on stathmin increased upon bortezomib treatment, suggesting new mechanisms associated to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in MM cells. Further studies demonstrated that stathmin phosphorylation profile was modified in response to bortezomib treatment and the regulation of stathmin by phosphorylation at specific Ser/Thr residues participated in the cellular response induced by bortezomib.

Protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events play a primary role in regulation of almost all aspects of cell function including signal transduction, cell cycle, or apoptosis. Thus far, T cell phosphoproteomics have focused on analysis of phosphotyrosine residues, and little is known about the role of serine/threonine phosphorylation in early activation of the T cell receptor (TCR). Therefore, we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based analysis of the global phosphoproteome of human primary T cells in response to 5 min of TCR activation with anti-CD3 antibody. Combining immunoprecipitation with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody, titanium dioxide phosphopeptide enrichment, isobaric tag for the relative and absolute quantitation methodology, and strong cation exchange separation, we were able to identify 2814 phosphopeptides. These unique sites were employed to investigate the site-specific phosphorylation dynamics. Five hundred and seventeen phosphorylation sites showed TCR-responsive changes. We found that upon 5 min of stimulation of the TCR, specific serine and threonine kinase motifs are overrepresented in the set of responsive phosphorylation sites. These phosphorylation events targeted proteins with many different activities and are present in different subcellular locations. Many of these proteins are involved in intracellular signaling cascades related mainly to cytoskeletal reorganization and regulation of small GTPase-mediated signal transduction, probably involved in the formation of the immune synapse."

Identification of the substrates of c-Src remains a major challenge, because there is no simple way to directly stimulate its activity. Here we combine the chemical rescue of mutant c-Src and global quantitative phosphoproteomics to obtain the first high resolution snapshot of the range of tyrosine phosphorylation events that occur in the cell immediately after specific c-Src stimulation. After enrichment by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we identified 29 potential novel c-Src substrate proteins. Tyrosine phosphopeptide mapping allowed the identification of 382 nonredundant tyrosine phosphopeptides on 213 phosphoproteins. Stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture-based quantitation allowed the detection of 97 nonredundant tyrosine phosphopeptides whose level of phosphorylation is increased by c-Src. A large number of previously uncharacterized c-Src putative protein targets and phosphorylation sites are presented here, a majority of which play key roles in signaling and cytoskeletal networks, particularly in cell adhesion.

We have set up a multi-dimensional phosphoproteomics strategy combining a number of well-established enrichment and fraction methods: An initial TiO(2) phosphopeptide pre-enrichment step is followed by post-fractionation using sequential elution from IMAC (SIMAC) to separate multi- and mono-phosphorylated peptides, and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) of the mono-phosphorylated peptides (collectively abbreviated \"TiSH\"). The advantages of the strategy include a high specificity and sample preparation workload reduction due to the TiO(2) pre-enrichment step, as well as low adsorptive losses. We demonstrate the capability of this strategy by quantitative investigation of early interferon-\u03b3 signaling in low quantities of insulinoma cells. We identified ~6600 unique phosphopeptides from 300 \u03bcg of peptides/condition (22 unique phosphopeptides/\u03bcg) in a duplex dimethyl labeling experiment, with an enrichment specificity>94%. When doing network analysis of putative phosphorylation changes it could be noted that the identified protein interaction network centered upon proteins known to be affected by the interferon-\u03b3 pathway, thereby supporting the utility of this global phosphoproteomics strategy.

Second, fragmentation spectra of phosphopeptides, in particular those of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine containing peptides, are often dominated by the loss of the phosphate group(s) and therefore lack the information required to identify the peptide sequence and the site of phosphorylation, and third, sequence database search engines and statistical models for data validation are not optimized for the specific fragmentation properties of phosphorylated peptides.

In this study, we examined the effects of two different mutations in plakoglobin on cell migration, stiffness, and adhesion.

The other is an N-terminal mutation causing dominant inheritance of ARVC without cutaneous abnormalities. To assess the effects of plakoglobin mutations on a broad range of cell mechanical behavior, we characterized a model system consisting of stably transfected HEK cells which are particularly well suited for analyses of cell migration and adhesion. Both mutations increased the speed of wound healing which appeared to be related to increased cell motility rather than increased cell proliferation. However, the C-terminal mutation led to dramatically decreased cell-cell adhesion, whereas the N-terminal mutation caused a decrease in cell stiffness.

A homozygous loss-of-function mutation of the Plakoglobin (Jup) gene, which encodes a major component of the desmosome and the adherens junction, had been identified in Naxos patients, although the underlying mechanism remained elusive. We generated Jup mutant mice by ablating Jup in cardiomyocytes. Jup mutant mice largely recapitulated the clinical manifestation of human ARVC: ventricular dilation and aneurysm, cardiac fibrosis, cardiac dysfunction and spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. Ultra-structural analyses revealed that desmosomes were absent in Jup mutant myocardia, whereas adherens junctions and gap junctions were preserved. We found that ventricular arrhythmias were associated with progressive cardiomyopathy and fibrosis in Jup mutant hearts. Massive cell death contributed to the cardiomyocyte dropout in Jup mutant hearts. Despite the increase of \u03b2-catenin at adherens junctions in Jup mutant cardiomyoicytes, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-mediated signaling was not altered. Transforming growth factor-beta-mediated signaling was found significantly elevated in Jup mutant cardiomyocytes at the early stage of cardiomyopathy, suggesting an important pathogenic pathway for Jup-related ARVC. These findings have provided further insights for the pathogenesis of ARVC and potential therapeutic interventions."

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is characterised by progressive fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular myocardium. Earlier studies described ARVC as non-inflammatory, non-coronary disorder associated with arrhythmias, heart failure and sudden death due to functional exclusion of the right ventricle. Molecular genetic studies have identified nine different loci associated with ARVC; accordingly each locus is implicated for each type of ARVC (ARVC1-ARVC9). So far five genes have been identified as containing pathogenic mutations for ARVC. Though mutations in each of the gene/s indicate disruption of different pathways leading to the condition, the exact pathogenesis of the condition is still obscure. This review tries to understand the pathogenesis of the condition by examining the individual proteins implicated and relate them to the pathways that could play a role in the aetiology of the condition. Cardiac ryanodine receptor (RYR-2), which regulates intra-cellular Ca(2+) concentration by releasing Ca(2+) reserves from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), was the first gene for ARVC. The mutation in this gene is believed to disrupt coupled gating of RYR-2, causing after-depolarisation, leading to arrhythmias followed by structural changes due to altered intra-cellular Ca(2+) levels. Three other genes implicated for ARVC, plakoglobin (Naxos disease), desmoplakin (ARVC8) and plakophilin (ARVC9) have prompted the speculation that ARVC is primarily a disease of desmosomes. But identification of TGFbeta-3 for ARVC1 and the role of all these three genes (plakoglobin, desmoplakin and plakophilin) in cardiac morphogenesis indicate some kind of signal-transducing pathway disruption in the condition. The finding that ARVC as a milder form of Uhl's anomaly indicates similar ontogeny for the condition. Further, discovery of apoptotic cells in the autopsy of the right ventricular myocardium of ARVC patients does indicate a common pathway for different types of ARVCs, which is more specific for the right ventricular myocardium involving desmosomal plaque proteins, growth factors and Ca(2+) receptors."

One boy died of severe heart failure at the age of 6 years, the other was transplanted because of severe heart failure at the age of 10 years. In addition, focal palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair were apparent in both boys. As similar phenotypes have been described in Naxos disease and Carvajal syndrome, respectively, the genes for plakoglobin (JUP) and desmoplakin (DSP) were screened for mutations using direct genomic sequencing. A novel homozygous 2 bp deletion was identified in an alternatively spliced region of DSP. The deletion 5208_5209delAG led to a frameshift downstream of amino acid 1,736 with a premature truncation of the predominant cardiac isoform DSP-1. This novel homozygous truncating mutation in the isoform-1 specific region of the DSP C-terminus caused Carvajal syndrome comprising severe early-onset heart failure with features of non-compaction cardiomyopathy, woolly hair and an acantholytic form of palmoplantar keratoderma in our patient.

BACKGROUND Inherited ventricular arrhythmias such as the long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) account for a relevant proportion of sudden cardiac death cases in young patients cohorts. The detailed pathogenetic mechanisms of inherited ventricular arrhythmias are still poorly understood because systematic investigations are difficult to perform due to low patient numbers and the lack of appropriate experimental models. However, recent advances in research and science have identified a genetic background for many of these diseases. PRESENT KNOWLEDGE In LQTS, various mutations in different genes encoding for cardiac potassium and sodium channel proteins have been identified (\"channelopathy\"), and initial progress in genotype-phenotype correlation is made. Mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene have also been identified in a subset of patients with Brugada syndrome, whereas a genetic background has not yet been demonstrated in idiopathic VF and right ventricular outflow-tract tachycardia (RVO-VT). Very recently, mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene have been identified in CPVT and in a subgroup of patients with ARVC. Although several chromosomal loci were suggested, no other responsible genes or mutations have been found in autosomal dominant forms of ARVC. However, in Naxos disease, a recessive form of ARVC with coexpression of palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair, a mutation in the plakoglobin gene has recently been discovered, thus underscoring the potential role of genetic alterations in cytoskeletal proteins in ARVC. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES In the next years, significant progress in the genetic diagnosis pathophysiologic understanding of disease mechanisms, genotype-phenotype correlation, and the development of gene- or target-directed treatment strategies can be expected in the field of inherited ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSION This review summarizes the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms, including aspects of pathoanatomy, autonomic innervation, genetics, and genotype-phenotype correlations with their potential implications for diagnosis and treatment of inherited ventricular arrhythmias."

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to examine the genotype-phenotype relation with respect to penetrance, age and severity of expression, disease progression and prognosis in a recessively inherited arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). BACKGROUND Naxos disease is a recessively inherited ARVC caused by a mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin (cell adhesion protein) in which the cardiac phenotype is associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair. METHODS Twelve families with Naxos disease underwent cardiac and molecular genetic investigation. Serial cardiac assessment with annual resting 12-lead and 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) and two-dimensional echocardiography was performed during 1 to 16 years, median 7 +/- 6 years in all 78 surviving members. RESULTS Twenty-eight surviving members were homozygous and 40 were heterozygous for the mutation. All adults who were homozygous (n = 26) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ARVC, the youngest by the age of 13 years. In eight who were heterozygous, minor ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities were observed. Of the 26 subjects who were affected homozygotes, 92% showed ECG abnormalities, 92% ventricular arrhythmias, 100% right ventricular structural alterations and 27% left ventricular involvement. During follow-up (10 +/- 6 years), 16 (62%) developed structural progression, 12 (46%) arrhythmic events and 7 (27%) heart failure. The annual disease-related and sudden death mortality was 3% and 2.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Autosomal recessive ARVC caused by a mutation in plakoglobin was 100% penetrant by adolescence. Affected subjects who were homozygous experienced progressive disease with adverse prognosis. A minority of subjects who were heterozygous showed minor ECG/echocardiographic changes, but clinically significant disease did not develop."

OBJECTIVES We tested the hypothesis that defective interactions between adhesion junctions and the cytoskeleton caused by the plakoglobin mutation in Naxos disease lead to remodeling of gap junctions and altered expression of the major gap junction protein, connexin43. BACKGROUND Naxos disease, a recessive form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, is associated with a high incidence of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Naxos disease is caused by a mutation in plakoglobin, a protein that links cell-cell adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton. METHODS Myocardial expression of connexin43 and other intercellular junction proteins was characterized in 4 patients with Naxos disease. Immunohistochemistry was performed in all 4 patients, and immunoblotting and electron microscopy were performed in 1 patient who died in childhood before overt arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy had developed. RESULTS Connexin43 expression at intercellular junctions was reduced significantly in both right and left ventricles in all patients with Naxos disease. Electron microscopy revealed smaller and fewer gap junctions interconnecting ventricular myocytes. Mutant plakoglobin was expressed but failed to localize normally at intercellular junctions. Localization of N-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenins, plakophilin-2, desmoplakin-1, and desmocollin-2 at intercalated disks appeared normal. CONCLUSIONS Remodeling of gap junctions occurs early in Naxos disease, presumably because of abnormal linkage between mechanical junctions and the cytoskeleton. Gap junction remodeling may produce a coupling defect which, combined with the subsequent development of pathologic changes in myocardium, could contribute to a highly arrhythmogenic substrate and enhance the risk of sudden death in Naxos disease."

BACKGROUND Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an autosomal dominant heart muscle disorder that causes arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. Previously we mapped the genetic locus for the triad of autosomal recessive ARVC, palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair (Naxos disease) to chromosome 17q21, in which the gene for plakoglobin is encoded. This protein is a key component of desmosomes and adherens junctions, and is important for the tight adhesion of many cell types, including those in the heart and skin. METHODS We studied 19 individuals with Naxos disease, as well as unaffected family members and unrelated individuals from the neighbouring Greek islands of Naxos and Milos. Gene sequence was determined by reverse transcriptase PCR from RNA isolated from the skin of an affected individual and mutations in other cases were confirmed by restriction-enzyme analysis. FINDINGS A homozygous 2 base pair deletion in the plakoglobin gene was identified only in the 19 affected individuals. This deletion caused a frameshift and premature termination of the protein, which was shown by western blot analysis. 29 clinically unaffected family members were heterozygous for the mutation; 20 unrelated individuals from Naxos and 43 autosomal dominant ARVC probands were homozygous for the normal allele. INTERPRETATION The finding of a deletion in plakoglobin in ARVC suggests that the proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion play an important part in maintaining myocyte integrity, and when junctions are disrupted, cell death, and fibrofatty replacement occur. Therefore, the discovery of a mutation in a protein with functions in maintaining cell junction integrity has important implications for other dominant forms of ARVC, related cardiomyopathies, and other cutaneous diseases."

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited disorder associated with arrhythmias and sudden death. A recessive mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin has been shown to cause Naxos disease, a cardiocutaneous syndrome characterized by ARVC and abnormalities of hair and skin. Here, we report, for the first time, a dominant mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin in a German family with ARVC but no cutaneous abnormalities. The mutation (S39_K40insS) is predicted to insert an extra serine residue at position 39 in the N-terminus of plakoglobin. Analysis of a biopsy sample of the right ventricle from the proband showed markedly decreased localization of plakoglobin, desmoplakin, and connexin43 at intercalated discs in cardiac myocytes. A yeast-two-hybrid screen revealed that the mutant protein established novel interactions with histidine-rich calcium-binding protein and TGF beta induced apoptosis protein 2. Immunoblotting and confocal microscopy in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lines transfected to stably express either wild-type or mutant plakoglobin protein showed that the mutant protein was apparently ubiquitylated and was preferentially located in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the S39_K40insS mutation may increase plakoglobin turnover via proteasomal degradation. HEK293 cells expressing mutant plakoglobin also showed higher rates of proliferation and lower rates of apoptosis than did cells expressing the wild-type protein. Electron microscopy showed smaller and fewer desmosomes in cells expressing mutant plakoglobin. Taken together, these observations suggest that the S39_K40insS mutation affects the structure and distribution of mechanical and electrical cell junctions and could interfere with regulatory mechanisms mediated by Wnt-signaling pathways.

Selenium may affect prostate cancer risk via its plasma carrier selenoprotein P which shows dramatically reduced expression in prostate cancer tumors and cell lines. The selenoprotein P (SEPP1) Ala234 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele is associated with lower plasma selenoprotein P in men, reducing the concentration/activity of other antioxidant selenoproteins. Selenium status also modifies the effect of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) SNP Ala16Val on prostate cancer risk. We investigated the relationship of these SNPs with prostate cancer risk. DNA from 2,975 cases and 1,896 age-matched controls from the population-based Prostate Cancer in Sweden study were genotyped using TaqMan assays. Cases were designated aggressive or nonaggressive prostate cancers at diagnosis by clinical criteria. Association with prostate cancer was investigated by logistic regression; gene-gene interaction using a general linear model. The mean plasma selenium concentration measured in 169 controls was relatively low (76.0 +/- 17.2 microg/L). SNP genotype distributions were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. SOD2-Ala16+ men were at a greater risk of prostate cancer [odds ratios (OR), 1.19; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.03-1.37] compared with SOD2-Val16 homozygotes.

In a low-selenium population, SOD2-Ala16+ men homozygous for SEPP1-Ala234 are at an increased risk of prostate cancer/aggressive prostate cancer especially if ever-smokers, because they are likely to produce more mitochondrial H(2)O(2) that they cannot remove, thereby promoting prostate tumor cell proliferation and migration."

Increased dietary intake of Selenium (Se) has been suggested to lower prostate cancer mortality, but supplementation trials have produced conflicting results. Se is incorporated into 25 selenoproteins. The aim of this work was to assess whether risk of prostate cancer is affected by genetic variants in genes coding for selenoproteins, either alone or in combination with Se status. 248 cases and 492 controls from an EPIC-Heidelberg nested case-control study were subjected to two-stage genotyping with an initial screening phase in which 384 tagging-SNPs covering 72 Se-related genes were determined in 94 cases and 94 controls using the Illumina Goldengate methodology. This analysis was followed by a second phase in which genotyping for candidate SNPs identified in the first phase was carried out in the full study using Sequenom. Risk of high-grade or advanced stage prostate cancer was modified by interactions between serum markers of Se status and genotypes for rs9880056 in SELK, rs9605030 and rs9605031 in TXNRD2, and rs7310505 in TXNRD1. No significant effects of SNPs on prostate cancer risk were observed when grade or Se status was not taken into account. In conclusion, the risk of high-grade or advanced-stage prostate cancer is significantly altered by a combination of genotype for SNPs in selenoprotein genes and Se status. The findings contribute to explaining the biological effects of selenium intake and genetic factors in prostate cancer development and highlight potential roles of thioredoxin reductases and selenoprotein K in tumour progression."

We evaluated the association between serum selenium status and prostate cancer risk in a population with relative low selenium concentrations considering effect modification by genetic variants in selenoprotein genes. MATERIALS AND METHODS A case-control study of 248 incident prostate cancer cases and 492 matched controls was nested within the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort.

A recently discovered selenoprotein, SEP15, which is highly expressed in the prostate, may play a role either independently or by modifying the effects of selenium. We genotyped four common single-nucleotide polymorphisms capturing common variation (frequency >5%; R(2) > 0.8) within SEP15, as well as rs5859 in the 3' untranslated region, previously reported to reduce the efficiency of selenium incorporation into SEP15. We examined the association of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms with PCa risk and PCa-specific mortality, as well as their interactions with plasma selenium levels, in the Physicians' Health Study. In this nested case-control study (1,286 cases and 1,267 controls), SEP15 polymorphisms were not significantly associated with PCa risk. However, among the cases, three variants were significantly associated with PCa-specific mortality [rs479341 hazard ratio (HR), 1.94; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.15-3.25; rs1407131 HR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.45-5.59; rs561104 HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.12-2.11] with a recessive model. Additionally, rs561104 significantly modified the association of plasma selenium with PCa survival (P(interaction) = 0.02); an inverse relationship of high levels of selenium with PCa mortality was apparent only among those without the increased risk genotype. This study provides evidence that SEP15 genetic variation may influence PCa mortality. Additionally, the association of selenium with PCa mortality was modified by a variant, suggesting the possibility that some men with PCa may benefit more from selenium than others, depending on their genotype."

BACKGROUND Data from human epidemiological studies, cultured mammalian cells, and animal models have supported a potentially beneficial role of selenium (Se) in prostate cancer prevention. In addition, Se-containing proteins including members of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) family and Selenium-Binding Protein 1 (SBP1) have been linked to either cancer risk or development. For example, SBP1 levels are typically reduced in tumors compared to non-cancerous tissue, with the degree of reduction associated with increasingly poor clinical outcome. METHODS In order to investigate inter-relationships between blood and tissue Se levels and GPx activity, tissue SBP1 levels, and disease aggressiveness using the Gleason score, we measured levels of selenium and selected selenoproteins in fasting serum and histologically normal prostate tissues obtained from 24 men undergoing radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. RESULTS GPx enzyme activity was inversely correlated with SBP1 levels in prostate tissue as determined by densitometry of Western blots obtained using anti-SBP1 antibodies [partial Spearman's correlation coefficients and corresponding P-values overall and in African-Americans = -0.42 (0.08) and -0.53 (0.10), respectively], which is consistent with previous observations in cultured cells and mice. Of particular interest was the positive correlation between tissue GPx activity and Gleason score, with this relationship achieving statistical significance among African-Americans (r = 0.67, P = 0.02).

Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer in men and a leading cause of cancer death. Prostatic gland accumulates reasonably high amount of selenium (Se), the element that prevents the development of PC. It is hypothesized that some selenoproteins inhibit the transformation of normal prostate epithelium into neoplasm. We studied Se levels in whole blood, plasma and prostate of 32 PC and 40 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients and in the control group composed of 39 healthy subjects. The selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was also measured in the patients' red cells, plasma and prostate tissue. Se concentration in whole blood and plasma in both groups of patients was lower as compared with controls, while in prostate gland it was significantly higher in PC than in BPH patients and controls. Red cell GSH-Px activity was the same in PC patients and controls but significantly lower in BPH patients. Plasma GSH-Px activity was significantly lower in PC patients than in the control group, and prostate GSH-Px activity was significantly lower in PC patients as compared with BPH patients. Since Se has anticancer properties, it is very likely that its low level in blood may facilitate the development of cancer. A higher level of Se in prostate of PC patients has no influence on GSH-Px activity in the gland."

Considerable animal and human data have indicated that selenium is effective in reducing the incidence of several different types of cancer, including that of the prostate. However, the mechanism by which selenium inhibits carcinogenesis remains unknown. One possibility is that dietary selenium influences the levels of selenium-containing proteins, or selenoproteins. Selenoproteins contain selenium in the form of selenocysteine and perform a variety of cellular functions, including antioxidant defense. To determine whether the levels of selenoproteins can influence carcinogenesis independent of selenium intake, a unique mouse model was developed by breeding two transgenic animals: mice with reduced selenoprotein levels because of the expression of an altered selenocysteine-tRNA (i6A-) and mice that develop prostate cancer because of the targeted expression of the SV40 large T and small t oncogenes to that organ [C3(1)/Tag]. The resulting bigenic animals (i6A-/Tag) and control WT/Tag mice were assessed for the presence, degree, and progression of prostatic epithelial hyperplasia and nuclear atypia. The selenoprotein-deficient mice exhibited accelerated development of lesions associated with prostate cancer progression, implicating selenoproteins in cancer risk and development and raising the possibility that selenium prevents cancer by modulating the levels of these selenoproteins."

To address the effects of selenium supplementation on selenoprotein expression in prostate cells, we have undertaken an analysis of antioxidant selenoprotein expression as well as selenium toxicity in non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1) and prostate cancer cells (LNCaP and PC-3). Our results show that two of the glutathione peroxidase family members (GPX1 and GPX4) are highly induced by supplemental selenium in prostate cancer cells but only slightly induced in RWPE-1 cells. In addition, GPX1 levels are dramatically lower in PC-3 cells as compared to RWPE-1 or LNCaP cells. GPX2 protein and mRNA, however, are only detectable in RWPE-1 cells. Of the three selenium compounds tested (sodium selenite, sodium selenate and selenomethionine), only sodium selenite shows toxicity in a physiological range of selenium concentrations. Notably and in contrast to previous studies, RWPE-1 cells were significantly more sensitive to selenite than either of the prostate cancer cell lines. These results demonstrate that selenoproteins and selenium metabolism are regulated at multiple levels in prostate cells."

Because mutations in RYR2 or in CASQ2 are not retrieved in all CPVT cases, we searched for mutations in the physiological protein partners of RyR2 and CSQ2 in a large cohort of CPVT patients with no detected mutation in these two genes. Based on a candidate gene approach, we focused our investigations on triadin and junctin, two proteins that link RyR2 and CSQ2. Mutations in the triadin (TRDN) and in the junctin (ASPH) genes were searched in a cohort of 97 CPVT patients. We identified three mutations in triadin which cosegregated with the disease on a recessive mode of transmission in two families, but no mutation was found in junctin. Two TRDN mutations, a 4 bp deletion and a nonsense mutation, resulted in premature stop codons; the third mutation, a p.T59R missense mutation, was further studied. Expression of the p.T59R mutant in COS-7 cells resulted in intracellular retention and degradation of the mutant protein. This was confirmed after in vivo expression of the mutant triadin in triadin knock-out mice by viral transduction. In this work, we identified TRDN as a new gene responsible for an autosomal recessive form of CPVT. The mutations identified in the two families lead to the absence of the protein, thereby demonstrating the importance of triadin for the normal function of the cardiac calcium release complex in humans."

BACKGROUND The genetic background of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) has been extensively investigated for the last decade in Western countries, but it remains unstudied in the Asian population. METHODS AND RESULTS In 50 Japanese probands from unrelated families who satisfied clinical criteria for CPVT, genetic testing was conducted in all exons on 3 CPVT-related genes: cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) and inward rectifier potassium channel 2 (KCNJ2), and the clinical features between RYR2-genotyped and -non-genotyped patient groups were compared. Genetic and clinical evaluation was also done in 46 family members. In the genetic screening, 28 (18 novel) RYR2 (56.0%), 1 compound heterozygous CASQ2 (2.0%) and 1 KCNJ2 (2.0%) mutation carriers were identified. In the RYR2 mutation-positive group, the frequency of bidirectional ventricular tachycardia and the use of \u03b2-blockers were significantly higher than in the mutation-negative group. In contrast, there was no significant difference in supraventricular arrhythmias between the 2 groups. With regard to disease penetrance, the number of family members of RYR2-genotyped probands with a clinical diagnosis of CPVT was high. CONCLUSIONS Thirty gene mutation carriers were found for 3 genes in 50 probands clinically diagnosed as having CPVT. The penetrance of CPVT phenotype was significantly higher in RYR2 mutation carriers, thus RYR2 gene screening in CPVT patients would be indispensable to prevent unexpected cardiac sudden death of young family members."

BACKGROUND Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial arrhythmic syndrome caused by mutations in genes encoding the calcium-regulation proteins cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) or calsequestrin-2 (CASQ2). Mechanistic studies indicate that CPVT is mediated by diastolic Ca(2+) overload and increased Ca(2+) leak through the RyR2 channel, implying that treatment targeting these defects might be efficacious in CPVT. METHOD AND RESULTS CPVT mouse models that lack CASQ2 were treated with Ca(2+) -channel inhibitors, \u03b2-adrenergic inhibitors, or Mg(2+) . Treatment effects on ventricular arrhythmia, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein expression and Ca(2+) transients of isolated myocytes were assessed. Each study agent reduced the frequency of stress-induced ventricular arrhythmia in mutant mice. The Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil was most efficacious and completely prevented arrhythmia in 85% of mice. Verapamil significantly increased the SR Ca(2+) content in mutant myocytes, diminished diastolic Ca(2+) overload, increased systolic Ca(2+) amplitude, and prevented Ca(2+) oscillations in stressed mutant myocytes. CONCLUSIONS Ca(2+) channel inhibition by verapamil rectified abnormal calcium handling in CPVT myocytes and prevented ventricular arrhythmias. Verapamil-induced partial normalization of SR Ca(2+) content in mutant myocytes implicates CASQ2 as modulator of RyR2 activity, rather than or in addition to, Ca(2+) buffer protein.

BACKGROUND Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome associated with mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (Ryr2) in the majority of patients. Previous studies of CPVT patients mainly involved probands, so current insight into disease penetrance, expression, genotype-phenotype correlations, and arrhythmic event rates in relatives carrying the Ryr2 mutation is limited. METHODS AND RESULTS One-hundred sixteen relatives carrying the Ryr2 mutation from 15 families who were identified by cascade screening of the Ryr2 mutation causing CPVT in the proband were clinically characterized, including 61 relatives from 1 family. Fifty-four of 108 antiarrhythmic drug-free relatives (50%) had a CPVT phenotype at the first cardiological examination, including 27 (25%) with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Relatives carrying a Ryr2 mutation in the C-terminal channel-forming domain showed an increased odds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.5-11.5; P=0.007, compared with N-terminal domain) compared with N-terminal domain.

We investigated clinical and biophysical characteristics of KCNJ2 mutation carriers with \"atypical ATS.\" METHODS AND RESULTS Mutational analyses of KCNJ2 were performed in 57 unrelated probands showing typical (\u22652 ATS features) and atypical (only 1 of the ATS features or CPVT) ATS.

We divided all carriers (n=45, including family members) into 2 groups: typical ATS (A) (n=21, 47%) and atypical phenotype (B) (n=24, 53%). Patients in (A) had a longer QUc interval [(A): 695 \u00b1 52 versus (B): 643 \u00b1 35 ms] and higher U-wave amplitude (0.24 \u00b1 0.07 versus 0.18 \u00b1 0.08 mV). C-terminal mutations were more frequent in (A) (85% versus 38%, P<0.05). There were no significant differences in incidences of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Functional analyses of 4 mutations found in (B) revealed that R82Q, R82W, and G144D exerted strong dominant negative suppression (current reduction by 95%, 97%, and 96%, respectively, versus WT at -50 mV) and T305S moderate suppression (reduction by 89%).

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial arrhythmogenic disorder associated with mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) genes. Previous in vitro studies suggested that RyR2 and CASQ2 interact as parts of a multimolecular Ca(2+)-signaling complex; however, direct evidence for such interactions and their potential significance to myocardial function remain to be determined. We identified a novel CASQ2 mutation in a young female with a structurally normal heart and unexplained syncopal episodes. This mutation results in the nonconservative substitution of glutamine for arginine at amino acid 33 of CASQ2 (R33Q). Adenoviral-mediated expression of CASQ2(R33Q) in adult rat myocytes led to an increase in excitation-contraction coupling gain and to more frequent occurrences of spontaneous propagating (Ca2+ waves) and local Ca2+ signals (sparks) with respect to control cells expressing wild-type CASQ2 (CASQ2WT). As revealed by a Ca2+ indicator entrapped inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of permeabilized myocytes, the increased occurrence of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks and waves was associated with a dramatic decrease in intra-SR [Ca2+]. Recombinant CASQ2WT and CASQ2R33Q exhibited similar Ca(2+)-binding capacities in vitro; however, the mutant protein lacked the ability of its WT counterpart to inhibit RyR2 activity at low luminal [Ca2+] in planar lipid bilayers. We conclude that the R33Q mutation disrupts interactions of CASQ2 with the RyR2 channel complex and impairs regulation of RyR2 by luminal Ca2+. These results show that intracellular Ca2+ cycling in normal heart relies on an intricate interplay of CASQ2 with the proteins of the RyR2 channel complex and that disruption of these interactions can lead to cardiac arrhythmia."

Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are the calcium release channels of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that provide the majority of calcium ions (Ca(2+)) necessary to induce contraction of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. In their intracellular environment, RyR channels are regulated by a variety of cytosolic and luminal factors so that their output signal (Ca(2+)) induces finely-graded cell contraction without igniting cellular processes that may lead to aberrant electrical activity (ventricular arrhythmias) or cellular remodeling. The importance of RyR dysfunction has been recently highlighted with the demonstration that point mutations in RYR2, the gene encoding for the cardiac isoform of the RyR (RyR2), are associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), an arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by the development of adrenergically-mediated ventricular tachycardia in individuals with an apparently normal heart. Here we summarize the state of the field in regards to the main arrhythmogenic mechanisms triggered by RyR2 channels harboring mutations linked to CPVT. Most CPVT mutations characterized to date endow RyR2 channels with a gain of function, resulting in hyperactive channels that release Ca(2+) spontaneously, especially during diastole. The spontaneous Ca(2+) release is extruded by the electrogenic Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, which depolarizes the external membrane (delayed afterdepolarization or DAD) and may trigger untimely action potentials. However, a rare set of CPVT mutations yield RyR2 channels that are intrinsically hypo-active and hypo-responsive to stimuli, and it is unclear whether these channels release Ca(2+) spontaneously during diastole. We discuss novel cellular mechanisms that appear more suitable to explain ventricular arrhythmias due to RyR2 loss-of-function mutations."

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic cardiac disorder characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias induced by physical or emotional stress, in the absence structural heart abnormalities. The arrhythmias may cause syncope or degenerate into cardiac arrest and sudden death which usually occurs during childhood. Recent studies have shown that CPVT is caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) or calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) genes. Both proteins are key contributors to the intracellular Ca(2+) handling process and play a pivotal role in Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol during systole. Although the molecular pathogenesis of CPVT is not entirely clear, it was suggested that the CPVT mutations promote excessive sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak, which initiates delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered arrhythmias in cardiac myocytes. The recent breakthrough discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) generated from somatic cells (e.g. fibroblasts, keratinocytes) now enables researches to investigate mutated cardiomyocytes generated from the patient's iPSC. To this end, in the present article we review recent studies on CPVT iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, thus demonstrating in the mutated cells catecholamine-induced DADs and triggered arrhythmias."

The trace element selenium is an essential micronutrient that is required for the biosynthesis of selenocysteine-containing selenoproteins. Most of the known selenoproteins are expressed in the thyroid gland, including some with still unknown functions. Among the well-characterized selenoproteins are the iodothyronine deiodinases, glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases, enzymes involved in thyroid hormone metabolism, regulation of redox state and protection from oxidative damage. Selenium content in selenium-sensitive tissues such as the liver, kidney or muscle and expression of nonessential selenoproteins, such as the glutathione peroxidases GPx1 and GPx3, is controlled by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed. As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens.

Interventional, prospective, randomized, controlled studies, including large observational studies, supplementing selenium in autoimmune thyroid disease, together with review articles published in Medline and Pubmed have undergone scrutiny. The methodological differences and variety of results emerging from these trials have been analyzed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Evidence in support of selenium supplementation in thyroid autoimmune disease is evaluated, the results herein presented demonstrating the potential effectiveness of selenium in reducing the antithyroid peroxidase titer and improving the echostructure in the ultrasound examination. However, considerable discord remains as to who should comprise target groups for selenium treatment, who will most benefit from such treatment, the precise impact of the basal antithyroid peroxidase level, and the effect of disease duration on the treatment outcome. Clearly, further in-depth studies and evaluation are required concerning the mechanism of action of selenium as well as the choice of supplements or dietary intake. CONCLUSIONS Maintenance of \"selenostasis\" via optimal intake not only aids preservation of general health but also contributes substantially to the prevention of thyroid disease."

Selenoproteins contain the essential trace element selenium whose deficiency leads to major disorders including cancer, male reproductive system failure, or autoimmune thyroid disease. Up to now, 25 selenoprotein-encoding genes were identified in mammals, but the spatiotemporal distribution, regulation, and function of some of these selenium-containing proteins remain poorly documented. Here, we found that selenoprotein T (SelT), a new thioredoxin-like protein, is regulated by the trophic neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) in differentiating but not mature adrenomedullary cells. In fact, our analysis revealed that, in rat, SelT is highly expressed in most embryonic structures, and then its levels decreased progressively as these organs develop, to vanish in most adult tissues. In the brain, SelT was abundantly expressed in neural progenitors in various regions such as the cortex and cerebellum but was undetectable in adult nervous cells except rostral migratory-stream astrocytes and Bergmann cells. In contrast, SelT expression was maintained in several adult endocrine tissues such as pituitary, thyroid, or testis. In the pituitary gland, SelT was found in secretory cells of the anterior lobe, whereas in the testis, the selenoprotein was present only in spermatogenic and Leydig cells. Finally, we found that SelT expression is strongly stimulated in liver cells during the regenerative process that occurs after partial hepatectomy. Taken together, these data show that SelT induction is associated with ontogenesis, tissue maturation, and regenerative mechanisms, indicating that this PACAP-regulated selenoprotein may play a crucial role in cell growth and activity in nervous, endocrine, and metabolic tissues."

CONTEXT Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. OBJECTIVE To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml, n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Differences in s-Se values. RESULTS S-Se was lower in patients with GD than in controls (mean (SD), GD: 89\u00b79 \u03bcg/l (18\u00b74); controls: 98\u00b78 \u03bcg/l (19\u00b77), P < 0\u00b701). This was confirmed in a multivariate logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, mineral supplements, smoking, geographical region and time of sampling (P < 0\u00b701). In a linear model, s-Se was similar in patients with AIH (mean (SD): 98\u00b74 \u03bcg/l (24\u00b79)) and in controls (P = 0\u00b786). In the multivariate model however, s-Se was marginally lower in patients with AIH compared to controls (P = 0\u00b704). There was no significant difference in s-Se between euthyroid participants with high TPO-Ab and random controls (linear: P = 0\u00b797; multivariate: P = 0\u00b727). CONCLUSION Patients with newly diagnosed GD and AIH had significantly lower s-Se compared with random controls. Our observation supports the postulated link between inadequate selenium supply and overt autoimmune thyroid disease, especially GD."

It is incorporated in the proteome in the forms of the genetically encoded amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine, which are the characteristic components of selenoproteins (SeP) such as glutathione peroxidases (GPx), thioredoxin reductases and iodothyronine deiodinase families. Thyroid is especially sensitive to selenium deficiency, because SeP can modify thyreocytes function by acting as antioxidants and modifying redox status and thyroid hormone metabolism. SeP are also involved in apoptosis, cell growth and modification of the action of cell signalling systems and transcription factors. Some intestinal GPx modulate apoptosis by removing the cells affected by oxidative damage preserving tissue integrity. The malfunctioning of the GPx antioxidant system in intestinal mucosa can trigger a continuous cycle of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Selenium deficiency is a risk factor, due to the malabsorption, in celiac disease (CD) because the inflammatory damage affects the small intestine; this deficiency can modulate SeP genes expression, with consequent reiteration of inflammation and increase of mucosal damage. In active CD, overexpression of interleukin-15 (IL-15) may increase activation of effector mechanisms of epithelial damage by stimulating T helper 1 cytokine proliferation and production and intraepithelial lymphocytes cytotoxicity by protecting these lymphocytes from apoptosis. Blocking IL-15 has the potential to provide new therapeutic tools to prevent both tissue damage and complication of CD such as autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) where IL-15 expression is also increases. In view of the role played by SeP in apoptosis inhibition, the presence of environmental factors such as selenium deficiency can be considered an important direct factor of thyroidal damage in development of AITD."

In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml. The primary end point of the study was the change in TPOAb concentrations. Secondary end points were changes in TgAb, TSH, and free thyroid hormone levels as well as ultrasound pattern of the thyroid and quality of life estimation. Patients were randomized into 2 age- and antibody (TPOAb)-matched groups; 36 patients received 200 microg (2.53 micromol) sodium selenite/d, orally, for 3 months, and 34 patients received placebo. All patients were substituted with L-T(4) to maintain TSH within the normal range. TPOAb, TgAb, TSH, and free thyroid hormones were determined by commercial assays. The echogenicity of the thyroid was monitored with high resolution ultrasound. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly to 63.6% (P = 0.013) in the selenium group vs. 88% (P = 0.95) in the placebo group. A subgroup analysis of those patients with TPOAb greater than 1200 IU/ml revealed a mean 40% reduction in the selenium-treated patients compared with a 10% increase in TPOAb in the placebo group. TgAb concentrations were lower in the placebo group at the beginning of the study and significantly further decreased (P = 0.018), but were unchanged in the selenium group. Nine patients in the selenium-treated group had completely normalized antibody concentrations, in contrast to two patients in the placebo group (by chi(2) test, P = 0.01). Ultrasound of the thyroid showed normalized echogenicity in these patients. The mean TSH, free T(4), and free T(3) levels were unchanged in both groups. We conclude that selenium substitution may improve the inflammatory activity in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, especially in those with high activity. Whether this effect is specific for autoimmune thyroiditis or may also be effective in other endocrine autoimmune diseases has yet to be investigated."

It is well known that selenium plays a fundamental role in regulating thyroid and other functions of the human body like reproduction, autoimmunity, glucose metabolism or bone metabolism. While for thyroid function investigation, radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children. Some investigators suggest that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease. Low serum selenium levels have been associated with higher incidence of thyroid cancer, as well as with chronic illness or lomicronw triiodothyronine syndrome. These biological actions are mediated through the expression of selenoproteins, the most important being the glutathione peroxidases, the iodothyronine deiodinases, the thioredoxine reductase and the selenoprotein P. Selenium is also associated with animal proteins. Subsequently meats and seafood are dietary sources of selenium. The ingestion of large quantities of selenium may have adverse effects. It has been shown that dietary intake of about 300 micro g of selenium daily may have a toxic effect on growth hormone and insulin like growth factor-1 metabolism, as well as in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Main adverse effects may be anorexia, diarrhea, depression, hemorrhage, liver and kidney necrosis, blindness, ataxia and respiratory disturbances. Dermatitis and CNS deficiency have also been described. It is concluded that selenium plays an important role in regulating thyroid function, as well as in the homeostasis of thyroid hormones through the action of selenoproteins, in which it incorporates as selenocystein."

INTRODUCTION In areas with severe selenium deficiency higher incidence of thyroiditis has been reported due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE To study the effect of selenium supplementation in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a blinded placebo-controlled prospective study done in 60 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (as defined by an anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) level more than 150 IU/ml) irrespective of the baseline thyroid status. Patients with overt hyperthyroidism who are on antithyroid drugs, patients on any other medication, which may alter the immunity status of the patients, and pregnant patients were excluded from the study. Patients were randomized into two age and TPOAb-matched groups; 30 patients received 200 \u03bcg of sodium selenite/day, orally, for 3 months, and 30 patients received placebo. All hypothyroid patients were given l-thyroxine replacement. RESULTS Of 30 patients in the selenium treated group, 6 patients were overtly hypothyroid, 15 were subclinical hypothyroid, 6 were euthyroid, and 3 were subclinical hyperthyroid. The mean TPOAb concentration decreased significantly by 49.5% (P < 0.013) in the selenium treated group versus 10.1% (P < 0.95) in the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSION Selenium substitution has a significant impact on inflammatory activity in thyroid-specific autoimmune disease. It would be of interest to determine whether early treatment with selenium in patients with newly developed autoimmune thyroiditis may delay or even prevent the natural course of these diseases."

Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1c1 (Oatp1c1) (also known as Slco1c1 and Oatp14) belongs to the family of Oatp and has been shown to facilitate the transport of T(4). In the rodent brain, Oatp1c1 is highly enriched in capillary endothelial cells and choroid plexus structures where it may mediate the entry of T(4) into the central nervous system. Here, we describe the generation and first analysis of Oatp1c1-deficient mice. Oatp1c1 knockout (KO) mice were born with the expected frequency, were not growth retarded, and developed without any overt neurological abnormalities. Serum T(3) and T(4) concentrations as well as renal and hepatic deiodinase type 1 expression levels were indistinguishable between Oatp1c1 KO mice and control animals. Hypothalamic TRH and pituitary TSH mRNA levels were not affected, but brain T(4) and T(3) content was decreased in Oatp1c1-deficient animals. Moreover, increased type 2 and decreased type 3 deiodinase activities indicate a mild hypothyroid situation in the brain of Oatp1c1 KO mice. Consequently, mRNA expression levels of gene products positively regulated by T(3) in the brain were down-regulated. This central nervous system-specific hypothyroidism is presumably caused by an impaired passage of T(4) across the blood-brain barrier and indicates a unique function of Oatp1c1 in facilitating T(4) transport despite the presence of other thyroid hormone transporters such as Mct8."

After exclusion of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and/or TPO antibodies (n = 16), higher serum TSH significantly predicted response (response rate per tertile from low to high TSH: 36%, 42%, and 67%). Heterozygous patients for the DII polymorphism (44%) had slightly lower serum TSH (P = 0.03) as compared to patients with the wild-type DII (47%).

Thyroxine dynamically regulates levels of type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (5'D-II) by modulating enzyme inactivation and targeting the enzyme to different pathways of internalization. 5'D-II is an approximately 200-kDa multimeric protein containing a 29-kDa substrate-binding subunit (p29) and an unknown number of other subunits. In the absence of thyroxine (T4), p29 is slowly endocytosed and transported to the lysosomes. T4 treatment rapidly activates an actin-mediated endocytotic pathway and targets the enzyme to the endosomes. In this study, we have characterized the influence of T4 on the intracellular trafficking of 5'D-II. We show that T4 accelerates the rate of 5'D-II inactivation by translocating the enzyme to the interior of the cell and by sequestering p29 in the endosomal pool without accelerating the rate of degradation of p29. This dichotomy between the rapid inactivation of catalytic activity and the much slower degradation of p29 is consistent with the reuse of p29 in the production of 5'D-II activity. Immunocytochemical analysis with a specific anti-p29 IgG shows that pulse affinity-labeled p29 reappears on the plasma membrane approximately 2 h after enzyme internalization in the presence of T4, indicating that p29 is recycled. Despite the ability of p29 to be recycled in the T4-treated cell, 5'D-II catalytic activity requires ongoing protein synthesis, presumably of another enzyme component(s) or an accessory enzyme-related protein. In the absence of T4, enzyme inactivation and p29 degradation are temporally linked, and pulse affinity-labeled p29 is internalized and sequestered in discrete intracellular pools. These data suggest that T4 regulates fundamental processes involved with the turnover of integral membrane proteins and participates in regulating the inter-relationships between the degradation, recycling, and synthetic pathways."

Intracellular generation of triiodothyronine (T3) from thyroxine (T4) by type 2 deiodinase (D2) in the mammalian brain, plays a key role in thyroid hormone action. The presence of D2 in rat astrocytes suggests the importance of glial cells in the regulation of intracellular T3 levels in the rat central nervous system (CNS). To analyze further the factors that regulate D2 activity in the CNS, we investigated the effects of nicotine and of mecamylamine, which inhibits the binding of nicotine with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, on D2 activity in cultured mixed glial cells of the rat brain. We incubated cultured mixed glial cells obtained from neonatal Wistar rats in the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol, 2 nM [125I] reverse T3 and 1 mM 6-N-propyl-2-thiouracil for 2 h at 37 degrees C, and the released 125I- was counted in a gamma counter. D2 activity of cultured cells was dependent on the temperature and the amount of protein. The basal D2 activity of rat mixed glial cells was 1.9 +/- 0.2 fmol of I- released/mg protein/h (mean +/- SEM). The addition of 10(-11), 2 x 10(-11), 10(-10), and 10(-9) M nicotine significantly increased D2 activity to approximately 2.2-, 2.4, 3.5- and 2.9-fold the basal level, respectively. D2 activity stimulated by 10(-8) M nicotine (2.5-fold) reached a peak after 9 h incubation. The stimulatory effect of nicotine was completely blocked by 10(-6) M mecamylamine. In conclusion, nicotine increases D2 activity probably via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and may influence brain function, at least in part, by affecting thyroid hormone metabolism."

In the present study we addressed the localization and subcellular distribution of D3 and MCT8 in neurosecretory neurons and addressed D3 function in their axons. Intense D3-immunoreactivity was observed in axon varicosities in the external zone of the rat median eminence and the neurohaemal zone of the human infundibulum containing axon terminals of hypophysiotropic parvocellular neurons. Immuno-electronmicroscopy localized D3 to dense-core vesicles in hypophysiotropic axon varicosities. N-STORM-superresolution-microscopy detected the active center containing C-terminus of D3 at the outer surface of these organelles. Double-labeling immunofluorescent confocal microscopy revealed that D3 is present in the majority of GnRH, CRH and GHRH axons but only in a minority of TRH axons, while absent from somatostatin-containing neurons. Bimolecular-Fluorescence-Complementation identified D3 homodimers, a prerequisite for D3 activity, in processes of GT1-7 cells. Furthermore, T3-inducible D3 catalytic activity was detected in the rat median eminence. Triple-labeling immunofluorescence and immuno-electronmicroscopy revealed the presence of MCT8 on the surface of the vast majority of all types of hypophysiotropic terminals. The presence of MCT8 was also demonstrated on the axon terminals in the neurohaemal zone of the human infundibulum. The unexpected role of hypophysiotropic axons in fine-tuned regulation of T3 availability in these cells via MCT8-mediated transport and D3-catalyzed inactivation may represent a novel regulatory core mechanism for metabolism, growth, stress and reproduction in rodents and humans."

Both preimmune serum as well as the primary antiserum exhausted with the peptide itself were used as negative controls. Extracts of chick cerebellum and liver were made in the presence of Triton X-100 to solubilize the membrane-bound deiodinases. Using these extracts in Western blot analysis, a band of the expected molecular weight ( approximately 30 kDa) could be detected in both tissues. Using a full-length (32)P-labeled type III deiodinase cRNA probe, we identified a single mRNA species in the cerebellum that was of the exact same size as the hepatic control mRNA (+/-2.4 kb).

In the brain, thyroid hormone dynamically regulates levels of the short-lived plasma membrane protein, type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase. In cultured astrocytes, thyroxine modulates deiodinase levels by activating cytoskeletal-plasma membrane interactions that increase the rate of inactivation of the enzyme. Here we characterized the effects of these thyroxine-dependent cytoskeletal interactions upon the route of internalization of the deiodinase by following the intracellular transit of the affinity-labeled substrate-binding subunit of the deiodinase (p29). Thyroxine rapidly induced the inactivation of the deiodinase and initiated the binding of p29 to F-actin. By 40 min, > 75% of the p29 had been transported to an endosomal pool, which was followed by dissociation of the F-actin-p29 complex. There was no significant accumulation of p29 in the dense lysosomes seen in the presence of thyroxine. In the absence of thyroxine, p29 was internalized and transported to the dense lysosomes at a rate parallel to the inactivation rate of the deiodinase (t1/2 0.75 and 0.64 h, respectively) without involvement with the microfilaments. These data demonstrate that thyroxine targets type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase to an endosomal pool by activating specific protein-F-actin interactions involved in microfilament-mediated intracellular protein trafficking."

Western blot analysis of hepatic and cerebellar extracts revealed a band of 27 kDa.

In accordance with the protein data, hypothyroidism resulted in the downregulation of cerebellar D1 mRNA. Finally, histological stainings confirmed that the lack of staining in the external germinal layer of 1-day-old euthyroid chicks was due to the fact that migration of immature granule cells from the external towards the internal layer was completed at this stage while cell migration was retarded in hypothyroid animals."

Herein, we evaluated the in vivo role of NER in the repair of DNA adducts generated by psoralens (mono- or bi-functional) and UV-A light (PUVA) in E. coli. Cultures of wild-type E. coli K12 and mutants for uvrA, uvrB, uvrC or uvrAC genes were treated with PUVA and cell survival was determined. In parallel, kinetics of DNA repair was also evaluated by the comparison of DNA sedimentation profiles in all the strains after PUVA treatment. The uvrB mutant was more sensitive to PUVA treatment than all the other uvr mutant strains. Wild-type strain, and uvrA and uvrC mutants were able to repair PUVA-induced lesions, as seen by DNA sedimentation profiles, while the uvrB mutant was unable to repair the lesions. In addition, a quadruple fpg nth xth nfo mutant was unable to nick PUVA-treated DNA when the crude cell-free extract was used to perform plasmid nicking. These data suggest that DNA repair of PUVA-induced lesions may require base excision repair functions, despite proficient UvrABC activity. These results point to a specific role for UvrB protein in the repair of psoralen adducts, which appear to be independent of UvrA or UvrC proteins, as described for the classical UvrABC endonuclease mechanism."

DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are unique among DNA lesions in their unusually bulky nature. We have recently shown that nucleotide excision repair (NER) and RecBCD-dependent homologous recombination (HR) collaboratively alleviate the lethal effect of DPCs in Escherichia coli. In this study, to gain further insight into the damage-processing mechanism for DPCs, we assessed the sensitivities of a panel of repair-deficient E. coli mutants to DPC-inducing agents, including formaldehyde (FA) and 5-azacytidine (azaC). We show here that the damage tolerance mechanism involving HR and subsequent replication restart (RR) provides the most effective means of cell survival against DPCs. Translesion synthesis does not serve as an alternative damage tolerance mechanism for DPCs in cell survival. Elimination of DPCs from the genome relies primarily on NER, which provides a second and moderately effective means of cell survival against DPCs. Interestingly, Cho rather than UvrC seems to be an effective nuclease for the NER of DPCs. Together with the genes responsible for HR, RR, and NER, the mutation of genes involved in several aspects of DNA repair and transactions, such as recQ, xth nfo, dksA, and topA, rendered cells slightly but significantly sensitive to FA but not azaC, possibly reflecting the complexity of DPCs or cryptic lesions induced by FA. UvrD may have an additional role outside NER, since the uvrD mutation conferred a slight azaC sensitivity on cells. Finally, DNA glycosylases mitigate azaC toxicity, independently of the repair of DPCs, presumably by removing 5-azacytosine or its degradation product from the chromosome."

Previous work using selected mutants and assays have indicated that pathogenic Neisseria spp. carry a functional NER system. In order to comprehensively examine the role of NER in Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA recombination and repair processes, the predicted NER genes (uvrA, uvrB, uvrC, uvrD, and mfd) were each disrupted by a transposon insertion, and the uvrB and uvrD mutants were complemented with a copy of each gene in an ectopic locus. Each uvr mutant strain was highly sensitive to UV irradiation and also showed sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide killing, confirming that all of the NER genes in N. gonorrhoeae are functional. The effect of RecA expression on UV survival was minor in uvr mutants but much larger in the mfd mutant. All of the NER mutants demonstrated wild-type levels of pilin antigenic variation and DNA transformation. However, the uvrD mutant exhibited higher frequencies of PilC-mediated pilus phase variation and spontaneous mutation, a finding consistent with a role for UvrD in mismatch repair.

The incorporation of ribonucleotides in DNA has attracted considerable notice in recent years, since the pool of ribonucleotides can exceed that of the deoxyribonucleotides by at least 10-20-fold, and single ribonucleotide incorporation by DNA polymerases appears to be a common event. Moreover ribonucleotides are potentially mutagenic and lead to genome instability. As a consequence, errantly incorporated ribonucleotides are rapidly repaired in a process dependent upon RNase H enzymes. On the other hand, global genomic nucleotide excision repair (NER) in prokaryotes and eukaryotes removes damage caused by covalent modifications that typically distort and destabilize DNA through the production of lesions derived from bulky chemical carcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites, or via crosslinking. However, a recent study challenges this lesion-recognition paradigm. The work of Vaisman et al. (2013) [34] reveals that even a single ribonucleotide embedded in a deoxyribonucleotide duplex is recognized by the bacterial NER machinery in vitro. In their report, the authors show that spontaneous mutagenesis promoted by a steric-gate pol V mutant increases in uvrA, uvrB, or uvrC strains lacking rnhB (encoding RNase HII) and to a greater extent in an NER-deficient strain lacking both RNase HI and RNase HII. Using purified UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins in in vitro assays they show that despite causing little distortion, a single ribonucleotide embedded in a DNA duplex is recognized and doubly-incised by the NER complex. We present the hypothesis to explain the recognition and/or verification of this small lesion, that the critical 2'-OH of the ribonucleotide - with its unique electrostatic and hydrogen bonding properties - may act as a signal through interactions with amino acid residues of the prokaryotic NER complex that are not possible with DNA. Such a mechanism might also be relevant if it were demonstrated that the eukaryotic NER machinery likewise incises an embedded ribonucleotide in DNA."

Nucleotide excision repair consists of excinuclease protein UvrABC endonuclease, multi-enzymatic complex which carries out repair of damaged DNA in sequential manner. UvrC protein is a part of this complex and thus helps to repair the damaged DNA of M. tuberculosis. Hence, structural bioinformatics study of UvrC protein from M. tuberculosis was carried out using homology modeling and molecular docking techniques. Assessment of the reliability of the homology model was carried out by predicting its secondary structure along with its model validation.

Helicases are frequently regulated by interactions with partner proteins, and immunoprecipitation experiments have previously indicated that UvrD interacts with UvrB, a component of the post-incision complex. We examined this interaction using 2-hybrid analysis and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and found that the N-terminal domain and the unstructured region at the C-terminus of UvrD interact with UvrB. We analysed the properties of a truncated UvrD protein that lacked the unstructured C-terminal region and found that it showed a diminished affinity for single-stranded DNA, but retained the ability to displace both UvrC and the lesion-containing oligonucleotide from a post-incision nucleotide excision repair complex. The interaction of the C-terminal region of UvrD with UvrB is therefore not an essential feature of the mechanism by which UvrD disassembles the post-incision complex during NER.

BACKGROUND Extensive genetic diversity and rapid allelic diversification are characteristics of the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, and are believed to contribute to its ability to cause chronic infections. Both a high mutation rate and frequent imports of short fragments of exogenous DNA during mixed infections play important roles in generating this allelic diversity. In this study, we used a genetic approach to investigate the roles of nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway components in H. pylori mutation and recombination. RESULTS Inactivation of any of the four uvr genes strongly increased the susceptibility of H. pylori to DNA damage by ultraviolet light. Inactivation of uvrA and uvrB significantly decreased mutation frequencies whereas only the uvrA deficient mutant exhibited a significant decrease of the recombination frequency after natural transformation. A uvrC mutant did not show significant changes in mutation or recombination rates; however, inactivation of uvrC promoted the incorporation of significantly longer fragments of donor DNA (2.2-fold increase) into the recipient chromosome. A deletion of uvrD induced a hyper-recombinational phenotype. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that the NER system has multiple functions in the genetic diversification of H. pylori, by contributing to its high mutation rate, and by controlling the incorporation of imported DNA fragments after natural transformation."

In addition to its prominence in producing genetic diversity in bacterial species, homologous recombination (HR) plays a key role in DNA repair and damage tolerance. The frequency of HR depends on several factors, including the efficiency of DNA repair systems as HR is involved in recovery of replication forks perturbed by DNA damage. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the major DNA repair pathways involved in repair of a broad range of DNA lesions generally induced by exogenous chemicals or UV-irradiation and its functions in the cells not exposed to DNA-damaging agents have attracted less attention. In this study we have developed an assay that enables to investigate HR between chromosomal loci of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida both in growing and stationary-phase cells. The present assay detects HR events between two non-functional alleles of phenol degrading genes that produce a functional allele and allow the growth of bacteria on phenol as a sole carbon source. Our results indicate that HR between chromosomal loci takes place mainly in the growing cells and the frequency of HR is reduced during the following starvation in NER-proficient P. putida but not in the case when bacteria lack UvrA or UvrB enzymes. The absence of UvrA or UvrB resulted in a hyper-recombination phenotype in P. putida, the cells were filamented and their growth was impaired even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. However, NER-deficient derivatives that overcame growth defects emerged rapidly. Such adaptation resulted in the decline of the frequency of HR. Although HR in actively replicating P. putida was still elevated in the adapted variants of the UvrA- and UvrB-deficient strains, the dynamics of emergence of the recombinants in these strains turned similar to NER-proficient bacteria. Additionally, we observed that HR was enhanced in the absence of the transcription repair coupling factor Mfd in growing cells but not during starvation. The frequency of HR was not affected by the UvrA homologue UvrA2 neither in NER-proficient bacteria nor in the absence of UvrA, suggesting a minor role of UvrA2 in NER. Thus, we conclude that NER functions are important also without exogenously induced DNA damage in P. putida and both transcription-coupled and global genome NER act to suppress HR in growing cells, whereas UvrA and UvrB are involved in the maintenance of the genome integrity also in stationary-phase cells."

Combined transcriptome and methylation analysis showed that the genes with moderate methylation levels had higher expression levels than genes with high and low methylation.

Significant progress has been made in the basic understanding of how various epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, miRNA expression, and higher order chromatin structure affect gene expression. The present review will focus on methylation and demethylation of histones. While the acetylation of histones has been at the forefront of well-characterized post-translational modifications of histones, including the development of inhibitors targeting de-acetylating enzymes, the past few years have witnessed a dramatic increase in knowledge regarding the role of histone methylation/demethylation. This is an exciting and rapidly evolving area of research, with much promise for potential clinical intervention in several cancers including breast cancer. We also summarize efforts to identity DNA methylation signatures that could be prognostic and/or predictive markers in breast cancer, focusing on recent studies using genome-wide approaches. Finally, we briefly review the efforts made by both the National Institutes of Health Epigenome Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas, especially highlighting the study of breast cancer epigenetics, exciting technological advances, potential roadblocks, and future directions."

DNA methylation patterns are characterized by highly conserved developmental programs, but allow for divergent gene expression resulting from stochastic epigenetic drift or divergent environments. Genome-wide methylation studies in monozygotic (MZ) twins are providing insight into the extent of epigenetic variation that occurs, irrespective of genotype. However, little is known about the variability of DNA methylation patterns in adolescence, a period involving significant and rapid physical, emotional, social, and neurodevelopmental change. Here, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation using the 450 K Illumina BeadChip in a sample of 37 MZ twin pairs followed longitudinally since birth to investigate: 1) the extent of variation in DNA methylation in identical genetic backgrounds in adolescence and; 2) whether these variations are randomly distributed or enriched in particular functional pathways. We also assessed stability of DNA methylation over 3-6 months to distinguish stable trait-like and variable state-like genes. A pathway analysis found high within-pair variability in genes associated with development, cellular mechanisms, tissue and cell morphology, and various disorders. Test-retest analyses performed in a sub-sample of 8 twin pairs demonstrated enrichment in gene pathways involved in organismal development, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling, and particular disorders. The variability found in functional gene pathways may plausibly underlie phenotypic differences in this adolescent MZ twin sample. Furthermore, we assessed stability of methylation over 3-6 months and found that some genes were stable while others were unstable, suggesting that the methylome remains dynamic in adolescence and that dynamic sites tend to be organized in certain gene pathways."

DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA involved in the regulation of gene expression by controlling the access to the DNA sequence. It is the most stable epigenetic mark and is widely studied for its role in major biological processes. Aberrant DNA methylation is observed in various pathologies, such as cancer. Therefore, there is a great interest in analyzing subtle changes in DNA methylation induced by biological processes or upon drug treatments. Here, we developed an improved methodology based on flow cytometry to measure variations of DNA methylation level in melanoma and leukemia cells. The accuracy of DNA methylation quantification was validated with LC-ESI mass spectrometry analysis. The new protocol was used to detect small variations of cytosine methylation occurring in individual cells during their cell cycle and those induced by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AzadC). Kinetic experiments confirmed that inheritance of DNA methylation occurs efficiently in S phase and revealed a short delay between DNA replication and completion of cytosine methylation. In addition, this study suggests that the uncoupling of 5AzadC effects on DNA demethylation and cell proliferation might be related to the duration of the DNA replication phase."

DNA methylation is a pervasive epigenetic DNA modification that strongly affects chromatin regulation and gene expression. To date, it remains largely unknown how patterns of DNA methylation differ between closely related species and whether such differences contribute to species-specific phenotypes. To investigate these questions, we generated nucleotide-resolution whole-genome methylation maps of the prefrontal cortex of multiple humans and chimpanzees. Levels and patterns of DNA methylation vary across individuals within species according to the age and the sex of the individuals. We also found extensive species-level divergence in patterns of DNA methylation and that hundreds of genes exhibit significantly lower levels of promoter methylation in the human brain than in the chimpanzee brain. Furthermore, we investigated the functional consequences of methylation differences in humans and chimpanzees by integrating data on gene expression generated with next-generation sequencing methods, and we found a strong relationship between differential methylation and gene expression. Finally, we found that differentially methylated genes are strikingly enriched with loci associated with neurological disorders, psychological disorders, and cancers. Our results demonstrate that differential DNA methylation might be an important molecular mechanism driving gene-expression divergence between human and chimpanzee brains and might potentially contribute to the evolution of disease vulnerabilities. Thus, comparative studies of humans and chimpanzees stand to identify key epigenomic modifications underlying the evolution of human-specific traits."

CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated activation of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) is coupled to circadian changes in histone modification at their promoters. Several chromatin modifiers, such as the deacetylases SIRT1 and HDAC3 or methyltransferase MLL1, have been shown to be recruited to the promoters of the CCGs in a circadian manner. Interestingly, the central element of the core clock machinery, the transcription factor CLOCK, also possesses histone acetyltransferase activity. Rhythmic expression of the CCGs is abolished in the absence of these chromatin modifiers.

We analyzed ChIP-Seq peaks of the Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 silencing proteins and discovered 238 unexpected euchromatic loci that exhibited enrichment of all three. Surprisingly, published ChIP-Seq datasets for the Ste12 transcription factor and the centromeric Cse4 protein indicated that these proteins were also enriched in the same euchromatic regions with the high Sir protein levels. The 238 loci, termed \"hyper-ChIPable\", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase II and polymerase III enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and ChIP enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide. The apparent enrichment of various proteins at hyper-ChIPable loci was not a consequence of artifacts associated with deep sequencing methods, as confirmed by ChIP-quantitative PCR. The localization of unrelated proteins, including the entire silencing complex, to the most highly transcribed genes was highly suggestive of a technical issue with the immunoprecipitations. ChIP-Seq on chromatin immunoprecipitated with a nuclear-localized GFP reproduced the above enrichment in an expression-dependent manner: induction of the GAL genes resulted in an increased ChIP signal of the GFP protein at these loci, with presumably no biological relevance.

BACKGROUND High-throughput sequencing is becoming the standard tool for investigating protein-DNA interactions or epigenetic modifications. However, the data generated will always contain noise due to e.g. repetitive regions or non-specific antibody interactions. The noise will appear in the form of a background distribution of reads that must be taken into account in the downstream analysis, for example when detecting enriched regions (peak-calling). Several reported peak-callers can take experimental measurements of background tag distribution into account when analysing a data set. Unfortunately, the background is only used to adjust peak calling and not as a pre-processing step that aims at discerning the signal from the background noise. A normalization procedure that extracts the signal of interest would be of universal use when investigating genomic patterns. RESULTS We formulated such a normalization method based on linear regression and made a proof-of-concept implementation in R and C++. It was tested on simulated as well as on publicly available ChIP-seq data on binding sites for two transcription factors, MAX and FOXA1 and two control samples, Input and IgG. We applied three different peak-callers to (i) raw (un-normalized) data using statistical background models and (ii) raw data with control samples as background and (iii) normalized data without additional control samples as background. The fraction of called regions containing the expected transcription factor binding motif was largest for the normalized data and evaluation with qPCR data for FOXA1 suggested higher sensitivity and specificity using normalized data over raw data with experimental background. CONCLUSIONS The proposed method can handle several control samples allowing for correction of multiple sources of bias simultaneously. Our evaluation on both synthetic and experimental data suggests that the method is successful in removing background noise."

The advent of high-throughput technologies such as ChIP-seq has made possible the study of histone modifications. A problem of particular interest is the identification of regions of the genome where different cell types from the same organism exhibit different patterns of histone enrichment. This problem turns out to be surprisingly difficult, even in simple pairwise comparisons, because of the significant level of noise in ChIP-seq data. In this paper we propose a two-stage statistical method, called ChIPnorm, to normalize ChIP-seq data, and to find differential regions in the genome, given two libraries of histone modifications of different cell types. We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods. We correlate the histone marks with gene expression data and confirm that histone modifications H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 act as respectively a repressor and an activator of genes. Compared to what was previously reported in the literature, we find that a substantially higher fraction of bivalent marks in ES cells for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 move into a K27-only state. We find that most of the promoter regions in protein-coding genes have differential histone-modification sites. The software for this work can be downloaded from http://lcbb.epfl.ch/software.html."

RESULTS We investigated the impact of library amplification bias on the identification of allele-specific (AS) molecular events from high-throughput sequencing data derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-seq). Putative AS DNA binding activity for RNA polymerase II was determined using ChIP-seq data derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines of two parent-daughter trios.

To alleviate this bias, we devised an amplification bias detection strategy, which filters out sites with low read complexity and sites featuring a significant excess of clonal reads.

These approaches contain numerous biases which may significantly influence the interpretation of the resulting data. Rigorous computational methods for detecting and removing such biases are still lacking. Also, multi-sample normalization still remains an important open problem. This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of ChIP-seq data by comparing 62 separate publicly available datasets, using rigorous statistical models and signal processing techniques. Statistical methods for separating ChIP-seq signal from background noise, as well as correcting enrichment test statistics for sequence-dependent and sonication biases, are presented.

These large bound and control regions on the same array allow clear evaluation of analytical methods.We introduce a novel normalization scheme specifically designed for ChIP-chip data from dual-channel arrays and demonstrate that this step is critical for correcting systematic dye-bias that may exist in the data. Subtraction of the mock (non-specific antibody or no antibody) control data is generally needed to eliminate the bias, but appropriate normalization obviates the need for mock experiments and increases the correlation among replicates.

CONCLUSIONS RG7112 induced tumor regressions in solid tumors from different histotype panels, and exhibited consistent high-level activity against ALL xenografts. This high level of activity supports prioritization of RG7112 for further evaluation."

BACKGROUND We report a proof-of-mechanism study of RG7112, a small-molecule MDM2 antagonist, in patients with chemotherapy-naive primary or relapsed well-differentiated or dedifferentiated MDM2-amplified liposarcoma who were eligible for resection. METHODS Patients with well-differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma were enrolled at four centres in France. Patients received up to three 28-day neoadjuvant treatment cycles of RG7112 1440 mg/m(2) per day for 10 days. If a patient progressed at any point after the first cycle, the lesion was resected or, if unresectable, an end-of-study biopsy was done. The primary endpoint was to assess markers of RG7112-dependent MDM2 inhibition and P53 pathway activation (P53, P21, MDM2, Ki-67, macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 [MIC-1], and apoptosis). All analyses were per protocol. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2009-015522-10. RESULTS Between June 3, and Dec 14, 2010, 20 patients were enrolled and completed pretreatment and day 8 biopsies. 18 of 20 patients had TP53 wild-type tumours and two carried missense TP53 mutations. 14 of 17 assessed patients had MDM2 gene amplification. Compared with baseline, P53 and P21 concentrations, assessed by immunohistochemistry, had increased by a median of 4\u00b786 times (IQR 4\u00b738-7\u00b797; p=0\u00b70001) and 3\u00b748 times (2\u00b705-4\u00b709; p=0\u00b70001), respectively, at day 8 (give or take 2 days). At the same timepoint, relative MDM2 mRNA expression had increased by a median of 3\u00b703 times (1\u00b723-4\u00b793; p=0\u00b7003) that at baseline. The median change from baseline for Ki-67-positive tumour cells was -5\u00b705% (IQR -12\u00b755 to 0\u00b705; p=0\u00b701). Drug exposure correlated with blood concentrations of MIC-1 (p<0\u00b70001) and haematological toxicity. One patient had a confirmed partial response and 14 had stable disease. All patients experienced at least one adverse event, mostly nausea (14 patients), vomiting (11 patients), asthenia (nine patients), diarrhoea (nine patients), and thrombocytopenia (eight patients). There were 12 serious adverse events in eight patients, the most common of which were neutropenia (six patients) and thrombocytopenia (three patients). DISCUSSION MDM2 inhibition activates the P53 pathway and decreases cell proliferation in MDM2-amplified liposarcoma. This study suggests that it is feasible to undertake neoadjuvant biopsy-driven biomarker studies in liposarcoma. FUNDING F Hoffmann-La Roche."

PURPOSE Antitumor clinical activity has been demonstrated for the MDM2 antagonist RG7112, but patient tolerability for the necessary daily dosing was poor. Here, utilizing RG7388, a second-generation nutlin with superior selectivity and potency, we determine the feasibility of intermittent dosing to guide the selection of initial phase I scheduling regimens. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model was developed on the basis of preclinical data to determine alternative dosing schedule requirements for optimal RG7388-induced antitumor activity. This PKPD model was used to investigate the pharmacokinetics of RG7388 linked to the time-course of the antitumor effect in an osteosarcoma xenograft model in mice. These data were used to prospectively predict intermittent and continuous dosing regimens, resulting in tumor stasis in the same model system. RESULTS RG7388-induced apoptosis was delayed relative to drug exposure with continuous treatment not required. In initial efficacy testing, daily dosing at 30 mg/kg and twice a week dosing at 50 mg/kg of RG7388 were statistically equivalent in our tumor model. In addition, weekly dosing of 50 mg/kg was equivalent to 10 mg/kg given daily. The implementation of modeling and simulation on these data suggested several possible intermittent clinical dosing schedules. Further preclinical analyses confirmed these schedules as viable options. CONCLUSION Besides chronic administration, antitumor activity can be achieved with intermittent schedules of RG7388, as predicted through modeling and simulation. These alternative regimens may potentially ameliorate tolerability issues seen with chronic administration of RG7112, while providing clinical benefit. Thus, both weekly (qw) and daily for five days (5 d on/23 off, qd) schedules were selected for RG7388 clinical testing."

Pressure overload-induced hypertrophy is a key step leading to heart failure. The Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) process that governs cardiac contractility is defective in hypertrophy/heart failure, but the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. To examine the intermolecular aspects of CICR during hypertrophy, we utilized loose-patch confocal imaging to visualize the signaling between a single L-type Ca(2+) channel (LCC) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in aortic stenosis rat models of compensated (CHT) and decompensated (DHT) hypertrophy. We found that the LCC-RyR intermolecular coupling showed a 49% prolongation in coupling latency, a 47% decrease in chance of hit, and a 72% increase in chance of miss in DHT, demonstrating a state of \"intermolecular failure.\" Unexpectedly, these modifications also occurred robustly in CHT due at least partially to decreased expression of junctophilin, indicating that intermolecular failure occurs prior to cellular manifestations. As a result, cell-wide Ca(2+) release, visualized as \"Ca(2+) spikes,\" became desynchronized, which contrasted sharply with unaltered spike integrals and whole-cell Ca(2+) transients in CHT. These data suggested that, within a certain limit, termed the \"stability margin,\" mild intermolecular failure does not damage the cellular integrity of excitation-contraction coupling. Only when the modification steps beyond the stability margin does global failure occur. The discovery of \"hidden\" intermolecular failure in CHT has important clinical implications."

Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) is an inherently regenerative process due to the Ca(2+)-dependent gating of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR) and is critical for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. This process is seen as Ca(2+) sparks, which reflect the concerted gating of groups of RyRs in the dyad, a specialised junctional signalling domain between the SR and surface membrane. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for the termination of regenerative CICR during the evolution of Ca(2+) sparks remain uncertain. Rat cardiac RyR gating was recorded at physiological Ca(2+), Mg(2+) and ATP levels and incorporated into a 3D model of the cardiac dyad which reproduced the time-course of Ca(2+) sparks, Ca(2+) blinks and Ca(2+) spark restitution. Model CICR termination was robust, relatively insensitive to the number of dyadic RyRs and automatic. This emergent behaviour arose from the rapid development and dissolution of nanoscopic Ca(2+) gradients within the dyad. These simulations show that CICR does not require intrinsic inactivation or SR calcium sensing mechanisms for stability and cessation of regeneration that arises from local control at the molecular scale via a process we call 'induction decay'."

It is well known that calcium-induced calcium-release in cardiac myocytes takes place in spatially restricted regions known as dyads, where discrete patches of junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum tightly associate with the t-tubule membrane. The dimensions of a dyad are so small that it contains only a few Ca\u00b2\u207a ions at any given time. Ca\u00b2\u207a signaling in the dyad is therefore noisy, and dominated by the Brownian motion of Ca\u00b2\u207a ions in a potential field. Remarkably, from this complexity emerges the integrated behavior of the myocyte in which, under normal conditions, precise control of Ca\u00b2\u207a release and muscle contraction is maintained over the life of the cell. This is but one example of how signal processing within the cardiac myocyte and other cells often occurs in small \"nano-domains\" where proteins and protein complexes interact at spatial dimensions on the order of \u223c1-10 nm and at time-scales on the order of nanoseconds to perform the functions of the cell.

We have investigated the effects of inhibiting the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) with the reversible inhibitor 2',5'-di(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (TBQ) on the properties of these waves. Cardiac myocytes were voltage clamped at a constant potential between -65 and -40 mV and spontaneous waves evoked by increasing external Ca(2+) concentration to 4 mm. Application of 100 microm TBQ decreased the frequency of waves. This was associated with increases of resting [Ca(2+)](i), the time constant of decay of [Ca(2+)](i) and the integral of the accompanying Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange current. There was also a decrease in propagation velocity of the waves. There was an increase of the calculated Ca(2+) efflux per wave. The SR Ca(2+) content when a wave was about to propagate decreased to 91.7 +/- 3.2%. The period between waves increased in direct proportion to the Ca(2+) efflux per wave meaning that TBQ had no effect on the Ca(2+) efflux per unit time. We conclude that (i) decreased wave frequency is not a direct consequence of decreased Ca(2+) pumping by SERCA between waves but, rather, to more Ca(2+) loss on each wave; (ii) inhibiting SERCA increases the chance of spontaneous Ca(2+) release propagating at a given SR content."

Quantification revealed that without isoproterenol, only 39% of ICa inactivation was due to Ca(2+), while with isoproterenol, inactivation was Ca(2+)-dependent (\u223c65%) and highly reliant on SR Ca(2+) (\u223c46%). Thus, SR Ca(2+) is not released in basal conditions, and ICa is the main trigger of contraction, whereas during a stress response, SR Ca(2+) is an important source of cytosolic Ca(2+). This was not attributed to differences in SR Ca(2+) load because caffeine-induced transients were not different in both conditions. Therefore, Ca(2+) stored in SR of trout cardiomyocytes may act as a safety mechanism, allowing greater contraction when higher contractility is required, such as stress or exercise."

PURPOSE Release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) induced by Ca(2+) influx through voltage-dependent sarcolemmal L-type Ca(2+) channels (CICR) in cardiac muscle cells has been implicated as a potential target contributing to anesthetic-induced myocardial depression. In an earlier study, we found that (1) a half-logistic (h-L) function, which represents a half-curve of a sigmoid logistic function with a boundary at the inflection point, curve-fits the first half of the ascending phases of the isometric myocardial tension and isovolumic left ventricular (LV) pressure waveforms better than a mono-exponential (m-E) function and (2) the h-L time constants are useful as inotropic indices. We report here our investigation of the potential application of an h-L function to the analysis of the first half of the ascending phase of the Ca(2+) transient curve (faCaT) that precedes and initiates myocardial contraction and the increase in LV pressure. METHODS Ca(2+) transients (CaT) were measured using the Ca(2+)-sensitive photoprotein aequorin, which was microinjected into seven isolated rabbit right ventricular and 15 isolated mouse LV papillary muscles. The faCaT data from the beginning of twitch stimulation to the maximum of the first-order time derivative of Ca(2+) concentration (dCa/dt(max)) was curve-fitted by the least-squares method using h-L and m-E function equations. RESULTS The mean correlation coefficient (r) values of the h-L and m-E curve-fits for the faCaTs were 0.9740 and 0.9654 (P < 0.05) in the rabbit and 0.9895 and 0.9812 (P < 0.0001) in the mouse. CONCLUSION The h-L curves tracked the amplitudes and time courses of the faCaTs in cardiac muscles more accurately than m-E functions. Based on this result, we suggest that the h-L time constant may be a more reliable index than the m-E time constant for evaluating the rate of CICR from the SR in myocardial Ca(2+) handling. The h-L approach may provide a more useful model for the study of CICR during the contraction process induced by anesthetic agents."

Calcium (Ca(2+))-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) is widely accepted as the principal mechanism linking electrical excitation and mechanical contraction in cardiac cells. The CICR mechanism has been understood mainly based on binding of cytosolic Ca(2+) with ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inducing Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). However, recent experiments suggest that SR lumenal Ca(2+) may also participate in regulating RyR gating through calsequestrin (CSQ), the SR lumenal Ca(2+) buffer. We investigate how SR Ca(2+) release via RyR is regulated by Ca(2+) and calsequestrin (CSQ). First, a mathematical model of RyR kinetics is derived based on experimental evidence. We assume that the RyR has three binding sites, two cytosolic sites for Ca(2+) activation and inactivation, and one SR lumenal site for CSQ binding. The open probability (P(o)) of the RyR is found by simulation under controlled cytosolic and SR lumenal Ca(2+). Both peak and steady-state P(o) effectively increase as SR lumenal Ca(2+) increases. Second, we incorporate the RyR model into a CICR model that has both a diadic space and the junctional SR (jSR). At low jSR Ca(2+) loads, CSQs are more likely to bind with the RyR and act to inhibit jSR Ca(2+) release, while at high SR loads CSQs are more likely to detach from the RyR, thereby increasing jSR Ca(2+) release. Furthermore, this CICR model produces a nonlinear relationship between fractional jSR Ca(2+) release and jSR load. These findings agree with experimental observations in lipid bilayers and cardiac myocytes."

The majority of contractile calcium in cardiac muscle is released from stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), by a process of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) through ryanodine receptors. Because CICR is intrinsically self-reinforcing, the stability of and graded regulation of cardiac EC coupling appear paradoxical. It is now well established that this gradation results from the stochastic recruitment of varying numbers of elementary local release events, which may themselves be regenerative, and which can be directly observed as calcium sparks. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are clustered in dense lattices, and most calcium sparks are now believed to involve activation of multiple RyRs. This implies that local CICR is regenerative, requiring a mechanism to terminate it. It was initially assumed that this mechanism was inactivation of the RyR, but during the decade since the discovery of sparks, no sufficiently strong inactivation mechanism has been demonstrated in vitro and all empirically determined gating schemes for the RyR give unstable EC coupling in Monte Carlo simulations. We consider here possible release termination mechanisms. Stochastic attrition is the spontaneous decay of active clusters due to random channel closure; calculations show that it is much too slow unless assisted by another process. Calcium-dependent RyR inactivation involving third-party proteins remains a viable but speculative mechanism; current candidates include calmodulin and sorcin. Local depletion of SR release terminal calcium could terminate release, however calculations and measurements leave it uncertain whether a sufficient diffusion resistance exists within the SR to sustain such depletion. Depletion could be assisted by dependence of RyR activity on SR lumenal [Ca(2+)]. There is substantial evidence for such lumenal activation, but it is not clear if it is a strong enough effect to account for the robust termination of sparks. The existence of direct interactions among clustered RyRs might account for the discrepancy between the inactivation properties of isolated RyRs and intact clusters. Such coupled gating remains controversial. Determining the mechanism of release termination is the outstanding unsolved problem of cardiac EC coupling, and will probably require extensive genetic manipulation of the EC coupling apparatus in its native environment to unravel the solution."

Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) has been observed in cardiac myocytes as elementary calcium release events (calcium sparks) associated with the opening of L-type Ca(2+) channels. In heart cells, a tight coupling between the gating of single L-type Ca(2+) channels and ryanodine receptors (RYRs) underlies calcium release. Here we demonstrate that L-type Ca(2+) channels activate RYRs to produce CICR in smooth muscle cells in the form of Ca(2+) sparks and propagated Ca(2+) waves. However, unlike CICR in cardiac muscle, RYR channel opening is not tightly linked to the gating of L-type Ca(2+) channels. L-type Ca(2+) channels can open without triggering Ca(2+) sparks and triggered Ca(2+) sparks are often observed after channel closure. CICR is a function of the net flux of Ca(2+) ions into the cytosol, rather than the single channel amplitude of L-type Ca(2+) channels. Moreover, unlike CICR in striated muscle, calcium release is completely eliminated by cytosolic calcium buffering. Thus, L-type Ca(2+) channels are loosely coupled to RYR through an increase in global [Ca(2+)] due to an increase in the effective distance between L-type Ca(2+) channels and RYR, resulting in an uncoupling of the obligate relationship that exists in striated muscle between the action potential and calcium release."

Insulin resistance plays a major role in the development of type 2 diabetes and obesity and affects a number of biological processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis. Though mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the development of insulin resistance and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, the precise mechanism linking the two is not well understood. We used high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity dependent diabetes mouse models to gain insight into the potential pathways altered with metabolic disease, and carried out quantitative proteomic analysis of liver mitochondria. As previously reported, proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation, branched chain amino acid degradation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation were uniformly up-regulated in the liver of HFD fed mice compared with that of normal diet. Further, our studies revealed that retinol metabolism is distinctly down-regulated and the mitochondrial structural proteins-components of mitochondrial inter-membrane space bridging (MIB) complex (Mitofilin, Sam50, and ChChd3), and Tim proteins-essential for protein import, are significantly up-regulated in HFD fed mice. Structural and functional studies on HFD and normal diet liver mitochondria revealed remodeling of HFD mitochondria to a more condensed form with increased respiratory capacity and higher ATP levels compared with normal diet mitochondria. Thus, it is likely that the structural remodeling is essential to accommodate the increased protein content in presence of HFD: the mechanism could be through the MIB complex promoting contact site and crista junction formation and in turn facilitating the lipid and protein uptake."

The mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS) is a conserved large hetero-oligomeric protein complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane, crucial for the maintenance of cristae morphology. MINOS has been suggested to represent the core of an extended protein network that controls mitochondrial function and structure, and has been linked to several human diseases. The spatial arrangement of MINOS within mitochondria is ill-defined, however. Using super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy, we determined the distribution of three known human MINOS subunits (mitofilin, MINOS1, and CHCHD3) in mammalian cells. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that all three subunits form similar clusters within mitochondria, and that MINOS is more abundant in mitochondria around the nucleus than in peripheral mitochondria. At the submitochondrial level, mitofilin, a core MINOS subunit, is preferentially localized at cristae junctions. In primary human fibroblasts, mitofilin labeling uncovered a regularly spaced pattern of clusters arranged in parallel to the cell growth surfaces. We suggest that this array of MINOS complexes might explain the observed phenomenon of largely horizontally arranged cristae junctions that connect the inner boundary membrane to lamellar cristae. The super-resolution images demonstrate an unexpectedly high level of regularity in the nanoscale distribution of the MINOS complex in human mitochondria, supporting an integrating role of MINOS in the structural organization of the organelle."

The MITO-MAP provides a comprehensive view of mitochondrial function including insights into the activity of uncharacterized mitochondrial proteins and the functional connection between mitochondria and the ER. The MITO-MAP also reveals a large inner membrane-associated complex, which we term MitOS for mitochondrial organizing structure, comprised of Fcj1/Mitofilin, a conserved inner membrane protein, and five additional components. MitOS physically and functionally interacts with both outer and inner membrane components and localizes to extended structures that wrap around the inner membrane.

The mitochondrial inner membrane contains a large protein complex crucial for membrane architecture, the mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS). MINOS is required for keeping cristae membranes attached to the inner boundary membrane via crista junctions and interacts with protein complexes of the mitochondrial outer membrane. To study if outer membrane interactions and maintenance of cristae morphology are directly coupled, we generated mutant forms of mitofilin/Fcj1 (formation of crista junction protein 1), a core component of MINOS. Mitofilin consists of a transmembrane anchor in the inner membrane and intermembrane space domains, including a coiled-coil domain and a conserved C-terminal domain. Deletion of the C-terminal domain disrupted the MINOS complex and led to release of cristae membranes from the inner boundary membrane, whereas the interaction of mitofilin with the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) were enhanced. Deletion of the coiled-coil domain also disturbed the MINOS complex and cristae morphology; however, the interactions of mitofilin with TOM and SAM were differentially affected. Finally, deletion of both intermembrane space domains disturbed MINOS integrity as well as interactions with TOM and SAM. Thus, the intermembrane space domains of mitofilin play distinct roles in interactions with outer membrane complexes and maintenance of MINOS and cristae morphology, demonstrating that MINOS contacts to TOM and SAM are not sufficient for the maintenance of inner membrane architecture."

Crista junctions (CJs) are tubular invaginations of the inner membrane of mitochondria that connect the inner boundary with the cristae membrane. These architectural elements are critical for mitochondrial function. The yeast inner membrane protein Fcj1, called mitofilin in mammals, was reported to be preferentially located at CJs and crucial for their formation. Here we investigate the functional roles of individual domains of Fcj1. The most conserved part of Fcj1, the C-terminal domain, is essential for Fcj1 function. In its absence, formation of CJ is strongly impaired and irregular, and stacked cristae are present. This domain interacts with full-length Fcj1, suggesting a role in oligomer formation. It also interacts with Tob55 of the translocase of outer membrane \u03b2-barrel proteins (TOB)/sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) complex, which is required for the insertion of \u03b2-barrel proteins into the outer membrane. The association of the TOB/SAM complex with contact sites depends on the presence of Fcj1. The biogenesis of \u03b2-barrel proteins is not significantly affected in the absence of Fcj1. However, down-regulation of the TOB/SAM complex leads to altered cristae morphology and a moderate reduction in the number of CJs. We propose that the C-terminal domain of Fcj1 is critical for the interaction of Fcj1 with the TOB/SAM complex and thereby for stabilizing CJs in close proximity to the outer membrane.

Mitochondria lacking mitofilin, the large core subunit of MINOS, are impaired in the biogenesis of \u03b2-barrel proteins of the outer membrane, whereas mutant mitochondria lacking any of the other five MINOS subunits import \u03b2-barrel proteins in a manner similar to wild-type mitochondria.

We show that APOOL is a mitochondrial membrane protein facing the intermembrane space. It specifically binds to cardiolipin in vitro but not to the precursor lipid phosphatidylglycerol. Overexpression of APOOL led to fragmentation of mitochondria, a reduced basal oxygen consumption rate, and altered cristae morphology. Downregulation of APOOL impaired mitochondrial respiration and caused major alterations in cristae morphology.

BACKGROUND To investigate the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, tumor location, socioeconomic status) and potential predisposing factors (alcohol, tobacco, mobile phone use, severe head trauma) of cerebral gliomas in a defined area of Northwest Greece. METHODS The prospective study was conducted in patients with gliomas referred to all 7 hospitals of a study area with a population of 488,435 inhabitants, from June 1, 2005, to May 31, 2007. Incidence rates (IR) were calculated as new cases diagnosed among residents of the study area during the study period per 100,000 inhabitants. A case-control study was carried out in order to study the possible association of the risk of glioma with smoking, alcohol, use of mobile phone, and severe cranial trauma. RESULTS A total of 56 glioma incident cases were identified with IRs of glioma and glioblastoma (GBM) at 5.73/10(5)/year and 3.69/10(5)/year, respectively. A male to female ratio of 1.25 was obtained in the GBM group. IRs of glioma and GBM for both males and females were higher in the age group 60-79. The most frequent anatomic location was the frontal lobe. 46.5% of the patients originated from the low, 25% from the middle and 28.5% from the high socioeconomic class. There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use. A trend for a positive association between the risk of glioma and a history of severe cranial trauma was observed, but this association was not statistically significant.

Some reports indicate that Caucasians have a higher incidence than African or Asian populations. With the exception of pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I), the prognosis of glioma patients is still poor. Fewer than 3% of glioblastoma patients are still alive at 5 years after diagnosis, older age being the most significant and consistent prognostic factor of poorer outcome. Gliomas are components of several inherited tumor syndromes, but the prevalence of these syndromes is very low. Many environmental and lifestyle factors including several occupations, environmental carcinogens, and diet have been reported to be associated with an elevated glioma risk, but the only factor unequivocally associated with an increased risk is therapeutic X-irradiation. In particular, children treated with X-irradiation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia show a significantly elevated risk of developing gliomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, often within 10 years after therapy.

The etiology of glioma, the most commonly diagnosed malignant brain tumor among adults in the United States, is poorly understood. N-nitroso compounds are known carcinogens, which are found in cigarette smoke and can induce gliomas in rats. On this basis, it has been hypothesized that cigarette smoking may be associated with an increased risk of glioma. We investigated the association between cigarette smoking and glioma risk in the National Breast Screening Study, which included 89,835 Canadian women aged 40-59 years at recruitment between 1980 and 1985. Linkages to national cancer and mortality databases yielded data on cancer incidence and deaths from all causes, respectively, with follow-up ending between 1998 and 2000. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between cigarette smoking and risk of glioma. During a mean of 16.4 years of follow-up, we observed 120 incident glioma cases. Among ever smokers, women who reported having quit smoking had a 51% increase in risk of glioma compared with never smokers (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.97-2.34), while current smokers did not appear to have an increase in risk. When the association with former smokers was further examined by years since quitting, women who had quit smoking >10 years before baseline were at a decreased risk of glioma compared with women who had quit within the 10 years prior to baseline (HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.29-1.07), indicating that the association between former smokers and glioma may be driven by women, who recently quit smoking. Compared with nonsmokers, duration of cigarette smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day and pack-years of smoking were associated with increased glioma risk, although the increases in risk were relatively modest. The present study provides some support for a positive association between cigarette smoking and risk of glioma."

EGF and EGF receptor (EGFR) interaction plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis of epithelial tissues. Variations of the EGF +61G/A (rs4444903) may lead to an alteration in EGF production and/or activity, which can result in individual susceptibility to brain glioma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential association between EGF +61G/A and brain glioma in a Chinese population. METHODS In this study, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism of EGF +61G/A in 677 patients with glioma and 698 gender- and age-matched controls. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method. RESULTS The A allele (minor Allele) was 33.0% in cases and 27.3% in controls. The additive model was more powerful to reveal the association in our study than that of recessive and dominant model. Our data showed the genotype G/A and A/A was associated with increased risk for glioma (adjusted OR = 1.48, 95%CI: 1.17-1.87, p = 0.001 for G/A, adjusted OR = 1.81, 95%CI: 1.20-2.72, p = 0.005 for A/A, respectively), and for glioblastoma (adjusted OR = 1.51, 95%CI: 1.06-2.17, p = 0.024 and adjusted OR = 2.35, 95%CI: 1.34-4.15, p = 0.003, respectively). The A allele significantly increased glioma risk (OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.11-1.55, p = 0.001). The additive model (G/G vs G/A vs A/A) showed that both G/A and A/A genotype increased glioma risk (adjusted OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.17-1.66, p = 0.0002).G/A and A/A genotypes or EGF +61 A allele increased risk in both low and high WHO grade glioma. Non-smokers with G/A and A/A genotype showed increased glioma risk compared with G/G genotype (adjusted OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.29-2.30, p = 0.0002 and adjusted OR = 1.81, 95%CI: 1.10-2.99, p = 0.020, respectively). This association was not found in ever- or current-smokers. CONCLUSIONS Our study indicated that G/A and A/A genotypes or EGF +61 A allele were associated with higher glioma risk in Chinese. This is in contrast with previous studies which reported G allele as a risk factor of glioma in Caucasian. The role of EGF +61 A/G polymorphism in glioma susceptibility needs further investigation."

The most frequent (65%) and most malignant histological type is the glioblastoma. Since the introduction of computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the incidence rates of brain tumors have been rather stable, with a tendency of higher rates in highly developed, industrialized countries. Some reports indicate that Caucasians have higher incidence than black or Asian populations, but to some extent, this may reflect socio-economic differences and under-ascertainment in some regions, rather than a significant difference in genetic susceptibility. With the exception of pilocytic astrocytomas, the prognosis of glioma patients is still poor. Less than 3% of glioblastoma patients are still alive at 5 years after diagnosis, higher age being the most significant predictor of poor outcome. Brain tumors are a component of several inherited tumor syndromes, but the prevalence of these syndromes is very low. Several occupations, environmental carcinogens, and diet (N-nitroso compounds) have been reported to be associated with an elevated glioma risk, but the only environmental factor unequivocally associated with an increased risk of brain tumors, including gliomas, is therapeutic X-irradiation. In particular, children treated with X-irradiation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia show a significantly elevated risk of developing gliomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), often within 10 years after therapy. TP53 mutations are frequent in low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas derived therefrom. Approximately 60% of mutations are located in the hot spot codons 248 and 273, and the majority of these are G:C-->A:T transitions at CpG sites. TP53 mutations are significantly more frequent in low-grade astrocytomas with promoter methylation of the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase repair gene, suggesting that, in addition to deamination of 5-methylcytosine, exogenous or endogenous alkylation in the O(6) position of guanine may contribute to the formation of these mutations."

Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including NEB (nebulin), TPM2 (beta-tropomyosin), TPM3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and ACTA1 (skeletal alpha-actin). 20-25% of NM cases carry ACTA1 defects and these particular mutations usually induce substitutions of single residues in the actin protein. Despite increasing clinical and scientific interest, the contractile consequences of these subtle amino acid substitutions remain obscure. To decipher them, in the present study, we originally recorded and analysed the mechanics as well as the X-ray diffraction patterns of human membrane-permeabilized single muscle fibres with a particular peptide substitution in actin, i.e. p.Phe352Ser. Results unravelled an unexpected cascade of molecular and cellular events. During contraction, p.Phe352Ser greatly enhances the strain of individual cross-bridges. Paradoxically, p.Phe352Ser also slightly lowers the number of cross-bridges by altering the rate of myosin head attachment to actin monomers. Overall, at the cell level, these divergent mechanisms conduct to an improved steady-state force production. Such results provide new surprising scientific insights and crucial information for future therapeutic strategies."

Congenital myopathies are clinical and genetic heterogeneous disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness ranging in severity. Three major forms have been identified: actin myopathy, intranuclear rod myopathy, and nemaline myopathy. Nemaline myopathy is the most common of these myopathies and is further subdivided into seven groups according to severity, progressiveness, and age of onset. At present, five genes have been linked to congenital myopathies. These include alpha-actin (ACTA1), alpha- and beta-tropomyosin (TPM3 and TPM2), troponin T (TNNT1), and nebulin (NEB). Their protein products are all components of the thin filament of the sarcomere. The mutations identified within these genes have varying impacts on protein structure and give rise to different forms of congenital myopathies. Greater understanding of muscle formation and cause of disease can be established through the study of the effect of mutations on the functional proteins. However, a major limitation in the understanding of congenital myopathies is the lack of correlation between the degree of sarcomeric disruption and disease severity. Consequently, great difficulty may be encountered when diagnosing patients and predicting the progression of the disorders. There are no existing cures for congenital myopathies, although improvements can be made to both the standard of living and the life expectancy of the patient through various therapies."

Nemaline myopathy is a structural congenital myopathy which may show both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. Mutations in three different genes have been identified as the cause of nemaline myopathy: the gene for slow alpha-tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) at 1q22-23, the nebulin gene (NEB) at 2q21.1-q22, and the actin gene (ACTA1) at 1q42. The typical autosomal recessive form appears to be the most common one and is caused by mutations in the nebulin gene. We have studied the pattern of nebulin labeling, in patients with the typical congenital form (ten patients), the severe congenital form (two patients) or the mild, childhood-onset form (one patient), using antibodies against three different domains of nebulin. A qualitative and quantitative nebulin analysis in muscle tissue showed the presence of nebulin in myofibers from all patients. Some differences relating to the rod structure were observed. The majority of the largest subsarcolemmal rods were not labeled with the N2 nebulin antibody (I-band epitope) and showed an indistinct pattern with the two antibodies directed to the Z-band portion of nebulin (epitopes M176-181 and serine-rich domain). Diffuse rods were not revealed using the three antibodies. A discordant pattern of nebulin N2 epitope labeling was found in two affected sisters with a mutation in the nebulin gene, suggesting that modifications in nebulin distribution inside the rods might occur with the progression of the disease. Western blot analysis showed no direct correlation with immunofluorescence data. In nine patients, the band had a molecular weight comparable to the normal control, while in one patient, it was detected with a higher molecular weight. Our results suggest that presence/absence of specific nebulin Z-band epitopes in rod structures is variable and could depend on the degree of rod organization."

The clinical variability, with differing age of onset and severity of symptoms makes the diagnosis of nemaline myopathy difficult in some cases.

We describe the severe form of nemaline myopathy diagnosed in two brothers who died at the age of 12 days and 9 months, due to respiratory insufficiency caused by severe muscle weakness. Polyhydramnios and weakness of foetal movements in the IIIrd trimester of pregnancy, as well as variable clinical severity were noted in both cases. Microscopically visible significant immaturity of muscle fibers was found in the skeletal muscle biopsy performed in one of the brothers. The diagnosis of nemaline myopathy was confirmed by the presence of nemaline bodies (rods) in sections stained using the Gomori trichrome method. Molecular studies of DNA isolated from blood leucocytes showed no mutation in the ACTA1 or the TPM3 genes.

Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a novel class of central nervous system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntington disease. The objective of the study was to investigate the metabolic changes in patients with Huntington disease before and after pridopidine treatment. METHODS [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging was used to measure the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose at baseline and after 14 days of open-label pridopidine treatment in 8 patients with Huntington disease. Clinical assessments were performed using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS Statistical parametric mapping analysis showed increased metabolic activity in several brain regions such as the precuneus and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus after treatment. In addition, after pridopidine treatment, the correlation between the clinical status and the cerebral metabolic activity was strengthened. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that pridopidine induces metabolic changes in brain regions implicated as important for mediating compensatory mechanisms in Huntington disease. In addition, the finding of a strong relationship between clinical severity and metabolic activity after treatment also suggests that pridopidine treatment targets a Huntington disease-related metabolic activity pattern."

Pridopidine is being developed for the treatment of impaired motor function associated with Huntington's disease and belongs to a new class of compounds known as dopidines, which act as dopaminergic stabilizers. In vitro studies have shown that pridopidine is a substrate for the P450 cytochrome 2D6 enzyme (CYP2D6), and clinical data show that the half-life of pridopidine is different following single dosing versus at steady state. To further investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of pridopidine and to establish whether dose adjustment is needed in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, a single-centre, open-label, multiple-dose study in healthy volunteers was performed. In total, 24 extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (EMs) and 12 poor CYP2D6 metabolizers (PMs) were enrolled. Both groups received 45 mg pridopidine twice daily (b.i.d.). Plasma samples were taken during the first day of b.i.d. dosing (Day 1) and at steady state, following 14 days of b.i.d. dosing. At Day 1, total exposure in PMs was almost three times higher than those in EMs (AUC0-\u221e = 11,192 and 3,782 h\u00b7ng/mL, respectively; PM/EM ratio = 2.96; p < 0.001). However, at steady state, PMs and EMs had comparable exposure due to a reduction in pridopidine elimination in EMs over time. Thus, at steady-state peak (C max) and total (AUC0-24) exposures were only 1.24 and 1.29 times higher, respectively, in PMs than EMs. These results support that pridopidine is a CYP2D6 auto-inhibitor. Pridopidine was well tolerated in both EMs and PMs. The slightly higher exposure level in PMs at steady state does not indicate a need for dose adjustment or genotyping for CYP2D6 metabolizer status."

BACKGROUND Huntington's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by motor, cognitive, and behavioural deficits. Pridopidine belongs to a new class of compounds known as dopaminergic stabilisers, and results from a small phase 2 study in patients with Huntington's disease suggested that this drug might improve voluntary motor function. We aimed to assess further the effects of pridopidine in patients with Huntington's disease. METHODS We undertook a 6 month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of pridopidine in the treatment of motor deficits in patients with Huntington's disease. Our primary endpoint was change in the modified motor score (mMS; derived from the unified Huntington's disease rating scale) at 26 weeks. We recruited patients with Huntington's disease from 32 European centres; patients were aged 30 years or older and had an mMS of 10 points or greater at baseline. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive placebo, 45 mg per day pridopidine, or 90 mg per day pridopidine by use of centralised computer-generated codes. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. We also assessed the safety and tolerability profile of pridopidine. For our primary analysis, all patients were eligible for inclusion in our full analysis set, in which we used the last observation carried forward method for missing values. We used an analysis of covariance model and the Bonferroni method to adjust for multiple comparisons. We used a prespecified per-protocol population as our sensitivity analysis. The \u03b1 level was 0\u00b7025 for our primary analysis and 0\u00b705 overall. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00665223. FINDINGS At 26 weeks, in our full analysis set the difference in mean mMS was -0\u00b799 points (97\u00b75% CI -2\u00b708 to 0\u00b710, p=0\u00b7042) in patients who received 90 mg per day pridopidine (n=145) versus those who received placebo (n=144), and -0\u00b736 points (-1\u00b744 to 0\u00b772, p=0\u00b7456) in those who received 45 mg per day pridopidine (n=148) versus those who received placebo. At the 90 mg per day dose, in our per-protocol population (n=114), the reduction in the mMS was of -1\u00b729 points (-2\u00b747 to -0\u00b712; p=0\u00b7014) compared with placebo (n=120). We did not identify any changes in non-motor endpoints at either dose. Pridopidine was well tolerated and had an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo. INTERPRETATION This study did not provide evidence of efficacy as measured by the mMS, but a potential effect of pridopidine on the motor phenotype of Huntington's disease merits further investigation. Pridopidine up to 90 mg per day was well tolerated in patients with Huntington's disease. FUNDING NeuroSearch A/S."

Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a new pharmacological class of agents affecting the central nervous system called dopaminergic stabilizers. Dopaminergic stabilizers act primarily at dopamine type 2 (D(2)) receptors and display state-dependent behavioural effects. This article aims to give an overview of the preclinical neurochemical and behavioural in vivo pharmacological properties of pridopidine. Pridopidine was given s.c. to male Sprague-Dawley rats (locomotor, microdialysis and tissue neurochemistry) and i.p. to Swiss male mice (tail suspension test). Pridopidine dose-dependently increased striatal tissue levels of the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanin (ED(50)=81 micromol/kg), and prefrontal cortex dialysate levels of dopamine and noradrenaline as measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The agent reduced hyperlocomotion (d-amphetamine: ED(50)=54 micromol/kg; MK-801: ED(50)=40 micromol/kg), but preserved spontaneous locomotor activity, confirming state-dependent behavioural effects. In addition, pridopidine significantly reduced immobility time in the tail suspension test. We conclude that pridopidine state-dependently stabilizes psychomotor activity by the dual actions of functional dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism and strengthening of cortical glutamate functions in various settings of perturbed neurotransmission. The putative restoration of function in cortico-subcortical circuitry by pridopidine is likely to make it useful for ameliorating several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Huntington's disease."

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive motor, cognitive and psychiatric deficits, associated with predominant loss of striatal neurons and caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein. There is so far neither cure nor approved disease-slowing therapy for HD, though recent clinical studies have shown a beneficial long-term effect of pridopidine in patients with HD. The nature of this effect, purely symptomatic or, in addition, neuroprotective, is difficult to elucidate in clinical trials. Pridopidine and (-)-OSU6162 are members of a new family of compounds referred to as dopaminergic stabilizers, which normalize abnormal dopamine neurotransmission. We investigated the effects of (-)-OSU6162 on huntingtin knocked-in striatal neurons in culture. Control neurons had normal full-length huntingtin with 7 glutamines while \"mutant\" neurons had large expansions (Q=111). We studied the dose-effect curves of (-)-OSU6162 on mitochondrial activity, LDH levels, necrosis and apoptosis in untreated Q7 and Q111 cells. In addition, we investigated the effects of (-)-OSU6162 on Q7 and Q111 neurons challenged with different neurotoxins such as sodium glutamate, H(2)O(2), rotenone and 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP). As we found prevention of toxicity of some of these neurotoxins, we investigated the putative neuroprotective mechanisms of action of (-)-OSU6162 measuring the effects of this dopaminergic stabilizer on expression and release of BDNF, the ratios of Bcl2/Bax proteins and of p-ERK/ERK, the levels of chaperones and GSH, and the effects of (-)-OSU6162 on dopamine uptake and release. We found that (-)-OSU6162, 3-150 \u03bcM, produces a dose dependent increase of mitochondrial activity and a reduction of cell death. (-)-OSU6162 does not change glutamate toxicity, but it partially prevents that of H(2)O(2), rotenone and 3-nitropropionic acid. (-)-OSU6162 increases the intracellular levels of BDNF and Bcl2/Bax and decreases those of p-ERK/ERK and CHIP in Q111 cells. (-)-OSU6162 increased (3)H-dopamine uptake and amphetamine-induced (3)H-dopamine release in E13 mouse mid brain neurons. Our studies demonstrate that (-)-OSU6162 improves survival and mitochondrial function in striatal Q111 neurons and the resistance of these cells to several striatal neurotoxins, suggesting that (-)-OSU6162 and related compounds should be tested for neuroprotection in animal models and, eventually, in patients with HD."

We examined the effects of 3 dosages of pridopidine, a dopamine-stabilizing compound, on motor function and other features of Huntington's disease, with additional evaluation of its safety and tolerability. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in outpatient neurology clinics at 27 sites in the United States and Canada. Two hundred twenty-seven subjects enrolled from October 24, 2009, to May 10, 2010. The intervention was pridopidine, either 20 (n=56), 45 (n=55), or 90 (n=58) mg daily for 12 weeks or matching placebo (n=58). The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to week 12 in the Modified Motor Score, a subset of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score. Measures of safety and tolerability included adverse events and trial completion on the assigned dosage. After 12 weeks, the treatment effect (relative to placebo, where negative values indicate improvement) of pridopidine 90 mg/day on the Modified Motor Score was -1.2 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.5 to 0.1 points; P = .08). The effect on the Total Motor Score was -2.8 points (95% CI, -5.4 to -0.1 points; nominal P = .04). No significant effects were seen in secondary outcome measures with any of the active dosages. Pridopidine was generally well tolerated. Although the primary analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect, the overall results suggest that pridopidine may improve motor function in Huntington's disease. The 90 mg/day dosage appears worthy of further study. Pridopidine was well tolerated."

The dopaminergic stabilizer pridopidine demonstrates state-dependent effects on locomotor activity, counteracting both hypo- and hyperactivity in rats. Pridopidine has been shown to display both functional dopamine D2 receptor antagonist properties and increase in biomarkers associated with NMDA-mediated glutamate transmission in the frontal cortex. To further characterise the effects of pridopidine on prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons, a series of in vivo electrophysiological studies were performed in urethane-anaesthetised rats. Pridopidine, administered at doses from 10 to 60 mg/kg (i.v.), dose dependently increased pyramidal cell firing in the majority of the neurons tested. Pridopidine induced a significant increase of 162 % in mean firing activity of PFC neurons, versus initial basal firing activity as the cumulative dose of 30 mg/kg, i.v., was administered. This enhancement of activity was due to increased firing frequency of already spontaneously active neurons, rather than an increase in population activity. The increase was partially reversed or prevented by a sub-threshold dose of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.). Microiontophoretic application of pridopidine had only moderate activating effects. The selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist A-68930 also had limited effects when administered by microiontophoretic application, but exerted a dose dependent (0.2-3 mg/kg, i.v.) activation of firing in the majority of neurons tested (10/16). However, inhibition of firing by systemic administration of A-68930 was also observed in a subgroup of neurons (6/16). Both activation and inhibition of firing induced by systemic administration of A-68930 were reversed by the systemic administration of SCH23390. The present data suggests that pridopidine enhances pyramidal cell firing via an indirect dopamine D1 receptor-mediated mechanism. These effects of pridopidine may serve to strengthen the cortico-striatal communication and to improve motor control in Huntington's disease for which pridopidine is currently in development."

OBJECTIVE Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital hypoplastic anemia caused by mutations in ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Our aim is to develop gene therapy for DBA patients with mutations in RPS19. We previously demonstrated that RPS19 gene transfer partially corrects erythroid development in vitro. In this study, we asked if RPS19 gene transfer corrects erythroid development in unsorted cells transplanted to immunodeficient mice and if the RPS19-corrected fraction has a proliferative advantage after transplantation. We further determined if high level of RPS19 expression is required for correction. MATERIAL AND METHODS Mobilized peripheral blood CD34(+) cells were transduced by oncoretroviral vector particles pseudotyped with the feline endogenous retrovirus envelope. Vectors containing two different promoters with different RPS19 transgene expression levels were compared. Transduced cells were transplanted to immunocompromised nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient-beta2 microglobulin null mice in order to assess therapeutic effects of RPS19 gene transfer in vivo. RESULTS We show that correction of erythroid development requires high RPS19 expression. The corrected fraction of unselected DBA cells have a survival advantage in vivo, suggesting that successful gene therapy may only require correction of a fraction of the patient cells. CONCLUSION Our findings are fundamental for development of clinical gene therapy for DBA because they demonstrate increased engraftment of RPS19-transduced cells without selection of gene-corrected cells prior to transplantation, an essential prelude to studying long-term therapeutic effects in emerging animal models for DBA."

BACKGROUND Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare, clinically heterogeneous, congenital red cell aplasia: 40% of patients have congenital abnormalities. Recent studies have shown that in western countries, the disease is associated with heterozygous mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) genes in about 50% of patients. There have been no studies to determine the incidence of these mutations in Asian patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. DESIGN AND METHODS We screened 49 Japanese patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (45 probands) for mutations in the six known genes associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia: RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A. RPS14 was also examined due to its implied involvement in 5q- syndrome. RESULTS Mutations in RPS19, RPL5, RPL11 and RPS17 were identified in five, four, two and one of the probands, respectively. In total, 12 (27%) of the Japanese Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients had mutations in ribosomal protein genes. No mutations were detected in RPS14, RPS24 or RPL35A. All patients with RPS19 and RPL5 mutations had physical abnormalities. Remarkably, cleft palate was seen in two patients with RPL5 mutations, and thumb anomalies were seen in six patients with an RPS19 or RPL5 mutation. In contrast, a small-for-date phenotype was seen in five patients without an RPL5 mutation. CONCLUSIONS We observed a slightly lower frequency of mutations in the ribosomal protein genes in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia compared to the frequency reported in western countries. Genotype-phenotype data suggest an association between anomalies and RPS19 mutations, and a negative association between small-for-date phenotype and RPL5 mutations."

BACKGROUND Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare, pure red blood cell aplasia of childhood due to an intrinsic defect in erythropoietic progenitors. About 40% of patients display various malformations. Anemia is corrected by steroid treatment in more than 50% of cases; non-responders need chronic transfusions or stem cell transplantation. Defects in the RPS19 gene, encoding the ribosomal protein S19, are the main known cause of Diamond-Blackfan anemia and account for more than 25% of cases. Mutations in RPS24, RPS17, and RPL35A described in a minority of patients show that Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a disorder of ribosome biogenesis. Two new genes (RPL5, RPL11), encoding for ribosomal proteins of the large subunit, have been reported to be involved in a considerable percentage of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS In this genotype-phenotype analysis we screened the coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries of RPS14, RPS16, RPS24, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A in 92 Italian patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia who were negative for RPS19 mutations. RESULTS About 20% of the patients screened had mutations in RPL5 or RPL11, and only 1.6% in RPS24. All but three mutations that we report here are new mutations.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare, pure red-cell aplasia that presents during infancy. Approximately 40% of cases are associated with other congenital defects, particularly malformations of the upper limb or craniofacial region. Mutations in the gene coding for the ribosomal protein RPS19 have been identified in 25% of patients with DBA, with resulting impairment of 18S rRNA processing and 40S ribosomal subunit formation. Moreover, mutations in other ribosomal protein coding genes account for about 25% of other DBA cases. Recently, the analysis of mice from which the gene coding for the heme exporter Feline Leukemia Virus subgroup C Receptor (FLVCR1) is deleted suggested that this gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of DBA. FLVCR1-null mice show a phenotype resembling that of DBA patients, including erythroid failure and malformations. Interestingly, some DBA patients have disease linkage to chromosome 1q31, where FLVCR1 is mapped. Moreover, it has been reported that cells from DBA patients express alternatively spliced isoforms of FLVCR1 which encode non-functional proteins. Herein, we review the known roles of RPS19 and FLVCR1 in ribosome function and heme metabolism respectively, and discuss how the deficiency of a ribosomal protein or of a heme exporter may result in the same phenotype."

Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (five to seven cases per million live births) characterized by an aregenerative, usually macrocytic anemia with an absence or less than 5% of erythroid precursors (erythroblastopenia) in an otherwise normal bone marrow. The platelet and the white cell counts are usually normal but neutropenia, thrombopenia or thrombocytosis have been noted at diagnosis. In 40 to 50% of DBA patients, congenital abnormalities mostly in the cephalic area and in thumbs and upper limbs have been described. Recent analysis did show a phenotype/genotype correlation. Congenital erythroblastopenia of DBA is the first human disease identified to result from defects in ribosomal biogenesis. The first ribosomal gene involved in DBA, ribosomal protein (RP) gene S19 (RPS19 gene), was identified in 1999. Subsequently, mutations in 12 other RP genes out of a total of 78 RP genes have been identified in DBA. All RP gene mutations described to date are heterozygous and dominant inheritance has been documented in 40 to 45% of affected individuals. As RP mutations are yet to be identified in approximately 50% of DBA cases, it is likely that other yet to be identified genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis or other pathways may be responsible for DBA phenotype."

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited red blood cell aplasia that usually presents during the first year of life. The main features of the disease are normochromic and macrocytic anemia, reticulocytopenia, and nearly absent erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. The patients also present with growth retardation and craniofacial, upper limb, heart and urinary system congenital malformations in ~30-50 % of cases. The disease has been associated with point mutations and large deletions in ten ribosomal protein (RP) genes RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL35A, RPL5, RPL11, RPS7, RPS10, RPS26, and RPL26 and GATA1 in about 60-65 % of patients. Here, we report a novel large deletion in RPL15, a gene not previously implicated to be causative in DBA. Like RPL26, RPL15 presents the distinctive feature of being required both for 60S subunit formation and for efficient cleavage of the internal transcribed spacer 1. In addition, we detected five deletions in RP genes in which mutations have been previously shown to cause DBA: one each in RPS19, RPS24, and RPS26, and two in RPS17. Pre-ribosomal RNA processing was affected in cells established from the patients bearing these deletions, suggesting a possible molecular basis for their pathological effect. These data identify RPL15 as a new gene involved in DBA and further support the presence of large deletions in RP genes in DBA patients."

IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD genetic and pharmacologically-driven variations in common mechanisms involved in the disposition of antidepressant medications may contribute to variable interpatient response. This review describes the pharmacological properties underlying the safety and efficacy of desvenlafaxine, a second-generation serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW literature published between January 2006 and September 2010 evaluating desvenlafaxine was reviewed. WHAT WILL THE READER GAIN Desvenlafaxine therapy is initiated at the therapeutic dose (50 mg/day) without a need for dose titration. Desvenlafaxine metabolism and distribution are not appreciably affected by altered function of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or permeability glycoprotein (P-gp). Desvenlafaxine has clinically insignificant effects on the activity of CYP and P-gp. The efficacy of desvenlafaxine in treating major depressive disorder has been established. Adverse events are characteristic of the SNRI class. Notably, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events with the 50 mg/day recommended therapeutic dose is comparable to that seen with placebo. TAKE HOME MESSAGE incremental benefits with desvenlafaxine, derived from straight-forward dosing, a simple metabolic profile and lack of interaction with active transporter P-gp and CYP enzymes may contribute to more consistent response, good tolerability and lower incidence of drug-drug interactions with concomitant medications."

This study assessed the efficacy of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day compared with placebo for treating moderate or severe major depressive disorder (MDD). Data were pooled from six double-blind, placebo-controlled, desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day fixed-dose studies in adults with MDD. The primary endpoint was improvement in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) scores from baseline at week 8. HAM-D17 changes were evaluated in patients with moderate (18<HAM-D17<25) or severe (HAM-D17\u226525) MDD at baseline using analysis of covariance with treatment, study, and baseline in the model. The pooled analysis included 2189 patients (desvenlafaxine 50 mg, n=1150; placebo, n=1039). Of those, 694 (32%) patients had severe depression at baseline. Desvenlafaxine improved HAM-D17 scores versus placebo in patients with either moderate [desvenlafaxine, adjusted mean (\u00b1SE), -10.26\u00b10.24; placebo, -8.87\u00b10.26; P<0.001] or severe MDD (desvenlafaxine, -11.91\u00b10.40; placebo, -9.85\u00b10.42; P<0.001).

Desvenlafaxine succinate (DVS) is one of several serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Others are venlafaxine hydrochloride, milnacipran, and duloxetine. Desvenlafaxine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on a number of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of DVS in doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg/day for the treatment of MDD in adult outpatients. The effects of DVS 50 mg/day have been clearly distinguished from placebo in the reduction of MDD symptoms in such clinical trials. No additional therapeutic benefits were found at doses > 50 mg/day. The recommended dose of DVS ranges from 50 to 100 mg. Desvenlafaxine is currently the third SNRI approved by the FDA for this indication. Preliminary evidence also suggests the clinical usefulness of DVS in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms of menopause, anxiety symptoms, and painful physical symptoms. The modified pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of DVS differentiate this drug from the original product, venlafaxine. Significant points of difference, compared with venlafaxine, are once-daily dosing and the achievement of steady-state plasma concentrations within 4 to 5 days. To summarize, current evidence indicates that DVS has proven efficacy, acceptable safety and tolerability profiles, convenient dosing, and minimal impact on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. A reduced risk for pharmacokinetic drug interactions is a potential advantage over other selective serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Desvenlafaxine succinate has demonstrated its efficacy for treating MDD but its variable efficacy, as shown in individual studies, limited long-term data, and its different risk-to-benefit ratio compared with earlier antidepressants, means that further investigation of this drug is necessary."

OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50- and 100-mg/day doses of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) MDD and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) scores > or =20 were randomly assigned to double-blind placebo or desvenlafaxine treatment (fixed dose of 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was the HAM-D(17). Changes from baseline in HAM-D(17) scores were analyzed using analysis of covariance. The final on-therapy evaluation was the primary endpoint for efficacy analyses, using last-observation-carried-forward data. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES AND RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 447 patients. Desvenlafaxine 50 mg was associated with a significantly greater adjusted mean change from baseline on the HAM-D(17) (-11.5) compared with placebo (-9.5, p=0.018); the 100-mg dose group (-11.0) did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.065). The 100-mg dose group experienced significant improvements compared with placebo on several secondary efficacy measures, including the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (p=0.038) and the Visual Analog Scale-Pain Intensity total score (p=0.041). Both desvenlafaxine doses were generally well-tolerated. The most common adverse events (incidence > or =10% in either desvenlafaxine group and twice the rate of placebo) were dry mouth, constipation, insomnia, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day for treating MDD. The significant findings on secondary measures support the efficacy of desvenlafaxine 100 mg, as seen in other trials. Conclusions may be limited by the exclusion of MDD patients with comorbid conditions and the short-term desvenlafaxine treatment duration."

The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in the HAM-D(17) score analyzed using analysis of covariance. Efficacy analyses were conducted with the intent-to-treat population, using the last observation carried forward. RESULTS The intent-to-treat population included 673 patients.

There were no differences among treatment groups in the rates of treatment response or remission. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 1.8%, 0.9%, and 1.8% of patients in the placebo and desvenlafaxine 10- and 50-mg/day groups, respectively. Overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events with both doses were similar to placebo. CONCLUSIONS Both doses of desvenlafaxine failed to separate from placebo. However, in a companion study reported separately, desvenlafaxine 50 mg, but not 25 mg, separated from placebo. Taken together, these studies suggest that 50 mg is the minimum effective dose of desvenlafaxine for the treatment of major depressive disorder.

INTRODUCTION The safety and tolerability profiles of antidepressants can often influence the treatment choices of clinicians treating major depressive disorder. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the safety and tolerability of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate) in treating depression. METHODS An integrated analysis of all short-term, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled registration studies for major depressive disorder (four flexible-dose and five fixed-dose studies) was performed. Adult outpatients with major depressive disorder received desvenlafaxine doses ranging from 50-400 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks. Treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs, and discontinuation symptoms were evaluated. In the subset of fixed-dose studies, dose-related effects were analyzed. RESULTS In the overall population (placebo: n=1,116; desvenlafaxine: n=1,834), adverse events resulted in discontinuations in 3% of placebo-treated patients and 12% of desvenlafaxine-treated patients; in the subset of fixed-dose studies, the rates were 4% with placebo and increased with desvenlafaxine dose (50 mg/day: 4%; 400 mg/day: 18%). The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was transient nausea that was generally mild to moderate. The most common sexual dysfunction associated with desvenlafaxine treatment was erectile dysfunction in men (7% vs 1% with placebo) and anorgasmia in women (1% and 0%). One desvenlafaxine-treated patient died of a completed suicide; there were four suicide attempts (three desvenlafaxine, one placebo) and eight cases of suicidal ideation (five desvenlafaxine, three placebo) during the on-therapy period. Small but statistically significant changes in mean blood pressure occurred at all desvenlafaxine doses; clinically meaningful changes were observed in 1% of placebo-treated patients and 2% of desvenlafaxine-treated patients. Desvenlafaxine was associated with small but statistically significant mean changes in laboratory assessments, particularly lipid and liver enzyme elevations, and electrocardiograms; few cases of these changes were clinically relevant. CONCLUSION Desvenlafaxine in the treatment of major depressive disorder exhibited a safety and tolerability profile generally consistent with the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor class. The most common adverse event was transient nausea. At the recommended therapeutic dose of 50 mg/day, discontinuation due to adverse events was similar to placebo."

A subpopulation of primitive cells from rat heart, expressing c-kit and myogenic transcriptional factors, GATA-4 and MEF 2C, exhibit a high in vitro proliferative potential. Progeny of these implanted cells have been shown to migrate along the infarcted scar, reconstitute regenerated cardiomyocytes with incorporation into host myocardium, and inhibit cardiac remodeling with decreased scar formation. In another study, TGF-beta has been shown to conduct the myogenic differentiation of stem cells by upregulating GATA-4 and NKx-2.5 expression and the intramyocardial implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed stem cells effectively assisted the myocardial regeneration.

METHODS Two weeks after permanent left coronary ligation in Lewis rats, the infarcted anterior wall was covered with polyester urethane urea (MI + PEUU; n = 15) or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (MI + ePTFE; n = 15) patches, or had no implantation (MI + sham; n = 12). Eight weeks after surgery, cardiac function and histology were assessed. RESULTS The ventricular wall in the MI + ePTFE and MI + sham groups was composed of fibrous tissue, whereas PEUU implantation induced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin-positive muscle bundles coexpressing sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin and cardiac-specific troponin-T. This pattern of colocalization was also found in developing embryonic myocardium. Cardiac transcription factors Nkx-2.5 and GATA-4 were strongly expressed in the muscle bundles. In the MI + sham group, end-diastolic LV cavity area (EDA) increased and the percentage of fractional area change (%FAC) decreased. For ePTFE patched animals, both EDA and %FAC decreased. In contrast, with MI + PEUU patching, %FAC increased and EDA was maintained. With dobutamine-stress echocardiography, MI + PEUU patched LVs possessed contractile reserve significantly larger than the MI + sham group. CONCLUSIONS MI + PEUU patch implantation onto subacute infarcted myocardium induced muscle cellularization with characteristics of early developmental cardiomyocytes as well as providing a functional reserve."

The expression pattern of angiotensin AT2 receptors with predominance during fetal life and upregulation under pathological conditions during tissue injury/repair process suggests that AT2 receptors may exert an important action in injury/repair adaptive mechanisms. Less is known about AT2 receptors in acute ischemia-induced cardiac injury. We aimed here to elucidate the role of AT2 receptors after acute myocardial infarction. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that cardiac AT2 receptors were mainly detected in clusters of small c-kit+ cells accumulating in peri-infarct zone and c-kit+AT2+ cells increased in response to acute cardiac injury. Further, we isolated cardiac c-kit+AT2+ cell population by modified magnetic activated cell sorting and fluorescence activated cell sorting. These cardiac c-kit+AT2+ cells, represented approximately 0.19% of total cardiac cells in infarcted heart, were characterized by upregulated transcription factors implicated in cardiogenic differentiation (Gata-4, Notch-2, Nkx-2.5) and genes required for self-renewal (Tbx-3, c-Myc, Akt). When adult cardiomyocytes and cardiac c-kit+AT2+ cells isolated from infarcted rat hearts were cocultured, AT2 receptor stimulation in vitro inhibited apoptosis of these cocultured cardiomyocytes. Moreover, in vivo AT2 receptor stimulation led to an increased c-kit+AT2+ cell population in the infarcted myocardium and reduced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in rats with acute myocardial infarction. These data suggest that cardiac c-kit+AT2+ cell population exists and increases after acute ischemic injury. AT2 receptor activation supports performance of cardiomyocytes, thus contributing to cardioprotection via cardiac c-kit+AT2+ cell population."

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The in vivo cardiac differentiation and functional effects of unmodified adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) after myocardial infarction (MI) is controversial. Our previous results suggested that hypergravity promoted the cardiomyogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and thus we postulated that ex vivo pretreatment of BMSCs using hypergravity and 5-azacytidine (5-Aza) would lead to cardiomyogenic differentiation and result in superior biological and functional effects on cardiac regeneration of infarcted myocardium. METHODS We used a rat MI model generated by ligation of the coronary artery. Homogeneous rat BMSCs were isolated, culture expanded, and differentiated into a cardiac lineage by adding hypergravity (2G) for 3 days and 5-Aza (50 lmol/L, 24 h). Rats underwent BMSCs (labeled with DAPI) injection after the infarction and were randomized into five groups. Group A rats received the control medium, Group B rats received unmodified BMSCs, Group C rats received BMSCs treated with hypergravity, Group D rats received BMSCs treated with 5-Aza, and Group E rats received BMSCs treated with 5-Aza and hypergravity (n = 6). RESULTS After hypergravity and 5-Aza treatment, BMSCs showed positive for the early muscle and cardiac markers GATA-4, MEF-2, and Nkx2-5 with RT-PCR. We also found that hypergravity could enhance the activities of MEF-2 via promoting the nuclear export of HDAC5. The frozen section showed that the implanted BMSCs labeled with DAPI survived and angiogenesis was identified at the implantation site. In Groups B, C, D, and E rats, pre-treated BMSCs colocalized with \u03b1-actinin, and Group E rats showed a significantly larger increase in left ventricular function. CONCLUSIONS The biological ex vivo cardiomyogenic differentiation of adult BMSCs with hypergravity and 5-Aza prior to their transplantation is feasible and appears to improve their in vivo cardiac differentiation as well as the functional recovery in a rat model of the infarcted myocardium."

Transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) release soluble factors that contribute to cardiac repair and vascular regeneration. We hypothesized that overexpression of GATA-4 enhances the MSC secretome, thereby increasing cell survival and promoting postinfarction cardiac angiogenesis. MSCs harvested from male rat bone marrow were transduced with GATA-4 (MSC(GATA-4)) using the murine stem cell virus retroviral expression system; control cells were either nontransduced (MSC(bas)) or transduced with empty vector (MSC(Null)). Compared with these control cells, MSC(GATA-4) were shown by immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, and Western blotting to have higher expression of GATA-4. An increased expression of angiogenic factors in MSC(GATA-4) and higher MSC resistance against hypoxia were observed. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with MSC(GATA-4) conditioned medium exhibited increased formation of capillary-like structures and promoted migration, compared with HUVECs treated with MSC(Null) conditioned medium. MSC(GATA-4) were injected into the peri-infarct region in an acute myocardial infarction model in Sprague-Dawley rats developed by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Survival of MSC(GATA-4), determined by Sry expression, was increased at 4 days postengraftment. MSC(GATA-4)-treated animals showed significantly improved cardiac function as assessed by echocardiography. Furthermore, fluorescent microsphere and histological studies revealed increased blood flow and blood vessel density and reduced infarction size in MSC(GATA-4)-treated animals. We conclude that GATA-4 overexpression in MSCs increased both MSC survival and angiogenic potential in ischemic myocardium and may therefore represent a novel and efficient therapeutic approach for postinfarct remodeling."

Transplantation of human cardiomyoblast-like cells (hCLCs) from human adipose tissue-derived multi-lineage progenitor cells improved left ventricular function and survival of rats with myocardial infarction. Here we examined the effect of intracoronary artery transplantation of human CLCs in a swine model of chronic heart failure. Twenty-four pigs underwent balloon-occlusion of the first diagonal branch followed by reperfusion, with a second balloon-occlusion of the left ascending coronary artery 1 week later followed by reperfusion. Four weeks after the second occlusion/reperfusion, 17 of the 18 surviving animals with severe chronic MI (ejection fraction <35% by echocardiography) were immunosuppressed then randomly assigned to receive either intracoronary artery transplantation of hCLCs hADMPCs or placebo lactic Ringer's solution with heparin. Intracoronary artery transplantation was followed by the distribution of DiI-stained hCLCs into the scarred myocardial milieu. Echocardiography at post-transplant days 4 and 8 weeks showed rescue and maintenance of cardiac function in the hCLCs transplanted group, but not in the control animals, indicating myocardial functional recovery by hCLCs intracoronary transplantation. At 8 week post-transplantation, 7 of 8 hCLCs transplanted animals were still alive compared with only 1 of the 5 control (p=0.0147). Histological studies at week 12 post-transplantation demonstrated engraftment of the pre DiI-stained hCLCs into the scarred myocardium and their expression of human specific alpha-cardiac actin. Human alpha cardiac actin-positive cells also expressed cardiac nuclear factors; nkx2.5 and GATA-4. Our results suggest that intracoronary artery transplantation of hCLCs is a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for future cardiac tissue regeneration."

BACKGROUND Recent data suggest that GATA-4 is an antiapoptotic factor required for adaptive responses and a key regulator of hypertrophy and hypertrophy-associated genes in the heart. As a leading cause of chronic heart failure, reversal of postinfarction left ventricular remodeling represents an important target for therapeutic interventions. Here, we studied the role of GATA-4 as a mediator of postinfarction remodeling in rats. METHODS AND RESULTS Myocardial infarction, caused by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery, significantly decreased the DNA binding activity of GATA-4 at day 1, whereas at 2 weeks the GATA-4 DNA binding was significantly upregulated. To determine the functional role of GATA-4, peri-infarct intramyocardial delivery of adenoviral vector expressing GATA-4 was done before left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Hearts treated with GATA-4 gene transfer exhibited significantly increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening. Accordingly, infarct size was significantly reduced. To determine the cardioprotective mechanisms of GATA-4, myocardial angiogenesis, rate of apoptosis, c-kit+ cardiac stemlike cells, and genes regulated by GATA-4 were studied. The number of capillaries and stemlike cells was significantly increased, and decreased apoptosis was observed. CONCLUSION These results indicate that the reversal of reduced GATA-4 activity prevents adverse postinfarction remodeling through myocardial angiogenesis, antiapoptosis, and stem cell recruitment. GATA-4-based gene transfer may represent a novel, efficient therapeutic approach for heart failure."

Although granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is reported to have a beneficial affect on postinfarction cardiac remodeling and dysfunction when administered before the onset of or at the acute stage of myocardial infarction (MI), its effect on established heart failure is unknown. We show here that subcutaneous administration of G-CSF greatly improves the function of murine hearts failing due to a large, healed MI. G-CSF changed the geometry of the infarct scar from elongated and thin to short and thick, induced hypertrophy among surviving cardiomyocytes, and reduced myocardial fibrosis. Expression of G-CSF receptor was confirmed in failing hearts and was upregulated by G-CSF treatment. G-CSF treatment also led to activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 and induction of GATA-4 and various sarcomeric proteins such as myosin heavy chain, troponin I and desmin. Expression of metalloproteinase-2 and -9 was also increased in G-CSF-treated hearts, while that of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) and transforming growth factor-beta1 was reduced. Although activation of Akt was noted in G-CSF-treated hearts, vessel density was unchanged, and apoptosis was too rare to exert a meaningful effect. No bone marrow-derived cardiomyocytes or vascular cells were detected in the failing hearts of green fluorescent protein chimeric mice. Finally, beneficial effects of G-CSF on cardiac function were found persisting long after discontinuing the treatment (2 weeks). Collectively, these findings suggest G-CSF administration could be an effective approach to treating chronic heart failure following a large MI."

BACKGROUND The heart is a highly vascular organ and prolonged interruption of myocardial blood flow initiates events that culminate in cardiac myocyte death. Proposed experimental reparative strategies include harvesting potent cells followed by direct injection into ischemic myocardium to achieve myogenesis and angiogenesis. METHODS Accordingly, we set out to isolate and expand a purified population of adult rat putative cardiomyocyte precursors, and to identify their characteristics in vitro. By using an acute myocardial infarction model and direct cell implantation, we further tested the hypothesis that these cells are an ideal cell source for myocardial regeneration and can enhance cardiac repair after implantation into the ischemic rat heart. RESULTS We describe here the identification of a subpopulation of primitive cells from rat heart, processing stem cell marker, c-kit and myogenic transcriptional factors, GATA-4 and MEF 2C, and cardiac specific proteins, troponin-I, alpha-sarcomeric actinin and connexin-43. They exhibited a high in vitro proliferative potential. These findings strongly suggest that these cells are putative cardiomyocyte precursors. After transplantation, they were able to be retained and proliferate (13.63 +/- 5.97% after 2 weeks) within the ischemic heart. Progeny of implanted cells migrated along the infarcted scar, reconstituted regenerated cardiomyocytes with incorporation into host myocardium, and inhibited cardiac remodeling with decreased scar formation. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that putative cardiomyocyte precursors isolated from adult heart could potentially be an autologous cell source for myocardial regeneration cell therapy."

BACKGROUND Recent studies have shown that bone marrow-derived stem cells differentiate into the phenotype of cardiomyocytes in vivo and in vitro. We tried to regenerate infarcted myocardium by implanting ex vivo transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-preprogrammed CD117 (c-kit)-positive (CD117+) stem cells intramyocardially. METHODS AND RESULTS CD117+ cells were isolated from the bone marrow mononuclear cells of GFP-transgenic or normal C57/BL6 mice. The myogenic differentiation of CD117+ cells was achieved by cultivation with TGF-beta. Using an acute myocardial infarction model, we also tried to regenerate infarcted myocardium by implanting untreated (newly isolated) or preprogrammed (24 hours of cultivation with 5 ng/mL TGF-beta1) CD117+ cells intramyocardially. TGF-beta increased the cellular expression of myosin, troponins, connexin-43, GATA-4, and NKx-2.5, which suggested that it induced the myogenic differentiation of CD117+ cells. Compared with the effects of PBS injection only, the microvessel density in the infarcted myocardium was increased significantly 3 months after the implantation of either TGF-beta-preprogrammed or untreated CD117+ cells. Moreover, many of the TGF-beta-preprogrammed CD117+ cells were stained positively for myosin, whereas few of the untreated CD117+ cells were. Histological analysis revealed newly regenerated myocardium in the left ventricular anterior wall after the implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed cells but not untreated cells. Furthermore, the left ventricular percent fraction shortening was significantly higher after the implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed cells than after the implantation of untreated CD117+ cells. CONCLUSIONS TGF-beta conducted the myogenic differentiation of CD117+ stem cells by upregulating GATA-4 and NKx-2.5 expression. Therefore, the intramyocardial implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed CD117+ cells effectively assisted the myocardial regeneration and induced therapeutic angiogenesis, contributing to functional cardiac regeneration."

Adult bone marrow (BM) harbors several small populations of cells which may contribute to cardiac and endothelial repair, such as endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and very small embryonic-like cells (VSELs) expressing several markers of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), such as Oct-4, Nanog and SSEA-1. Such cells were identified in mice bone marrow, peripheral blood and solid organs as well as in umbilical cord blood (UCB) and peripheral blood (PB) in humans. The adult BM-derived VSELs may undergo differentiation into cells derived for all three germ layers, including cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells. VSELs can be isolated using a multiparameter live cell sorting technique with special gating strategy based on their small size, expression of stem cell markers (Sca-1 in mice, CXCR4 and CD133 in humans) and absence of hematopoietic lineage markers (CD45(-) Lin(-)). Experiments in murine models of myocardial infarction (MI) demonstrated population of VSELs expressed also early markers of cardiac and endothelial lineages (GATA-4, Nkx2.5/Csx, VE-cadherin, von Willebrand factor) which migrated to stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and other chemoattractant gradient and underwent rapid mobilization into peripheral blood in experimental MI mice models. Recently, we demonstrated the mobilization of VSELs expressing PSC, early cardiac and endothelial markers in patients with acute MI. In addition to BM, VSELs were also identified in several murine solid organs including the heart and brain, as well as in umbilical cord blood and peripheral blood in adult humans. We hypothesized that VSELs are quiescent progeny of epiblast-derived PSCs that are deposited during organogenesis in developing organs. In experimental MI intramyocardial injection of VSELs was more efficient than that of HSCs at improving left ventricular ejection fraction and attenuation of myocardial hypertrophy. VSELs can be useful in translational studies of cardiovascular repair."

All of the patients were scored with the Tokuhashi revised scoring system based on the available clinical, pathological and radiographic data. The relation between the survival time and the Tokuhashi revised score was analyzed. RESULTS The patients had a median survival time of 7. 9 months and a mean Tokuhashi revised score of 8. 23 points. The median survival time of 155 patients with high grade primary tumor of lung, liver, gastrointestinal tract, esophagus, bladder and pancreas was 4. 7 months. The median survival time of 146 patients with low grade primary tumor of thyroid, breast and prostate was 12 months.

PURPOSE The revised Tokuhashi score has been widely used to evaluate indications for surgery and predict survival in patients with metastatic spinal disease. Our aim was to analyse the actual survival time of patients treated for metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) in comparison with the predicted survival based on the revised Tokuhashi score. This would thereby allow us to determine the overall predictive value of this scoring system. METHODS This study was a semi-prospective clinical study of all patients with MSCC presenting to our unit over 8 years-data from October 2003 to December 2009 were collected retrospectively and from December 2009, all data collected prospectively to October 2011. Patients were divided into three groups--Group 1 (Tokuhashi score 0-8, n = 84), Group 2 (Tokuhashi score 9-11, n = 83) and Group 3 (Tokuhashi score 12-15, n = 34). Data collected included demographic data, primary tumour histology, surgery type and complications, neurological outcome (Frankel grade) and survival. RESULTS A total of 233 patients with MSCC were managed surgically in our unit during this time. Out of these complete data were available on 201 patients for analysis. Mean age of patients was 61 years (range 18-86; 127 M, 74 F). The primary tumour type was Breast (n = 29, 15 %), Haematological (n = 28, 14 %), Renal (n = 26, 13 %), Prostate (n = 26, 13 %), Lung (n = 23, 11 %), Gastro-intestinal (n = 11, 5 %), Sarcoma (n = 9, 4 %) and others (n = 49, 24 %). All patients included in the study had surgical intervention in the form of decompression and stabilisation. Posterior decompression and stabilisation was performed in 171 patients (with vertebrectomy in 31), combined anterior and posterior approaches were used in 18 patients and 12 had an anterior approach only. The overall complication rate was 19 % (39/201)--the most common being wound infection (n = 15, 8 %). There was no difference in the neurological outcome (Frankel grade) between Groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.34) or Groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.70). However, there was a significant difference between Groups 1 and 3 (p = 0.001), with Group 3 having a significantly better neurological outcome. Median survival was 93 days in Group 1, 229 days in Group 2 and 875 days in Group 3 (p = 0.001). The predictive value between the actual and predicted survival was 64 % (Group 1), 64 % (Group 2) and 69 % (Group 3). The overall predictive value of the revised Tokuhashi score using Cox regression for all groups was 66 %. CONCLUSION We would conclude that although the predictive value of the Tokuhashi score in terms of survival time is at best modest (66 %), the fact that there were statistically significant differences in survival between the groups looked at in this paper indicates that the scoring system, and the components which it consists of, are important in the evaluation of these patients when considering surgery."

To compare the actual survival time with the expected survival time of the three scores by Kaplan-Meier method. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between the survival time and three scoring systems. RESULTS All cases were followed-up with an average duration of 10.9 months, and 77 patients died. AUC analysis of ROC curves showed that the difference of the accuracy of the three scores was not significant. AUC in all groups of Tokuhashi Score was low, with a poor diagnostic accuracy.

We compared the Tokuhashi and Tomita scoring systems, two commonly used scoring systems for prognosis in spinal metastases. We also assessed the different variables separately with respect to their value in predicting postsurgical life expectancy. Finally, we suggest criteria for selecting patients for surgery based on the postoperative survival pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients who had been operated for metastatic disease of the spine. Predictive scoring was done according to the scoring systems proposed by Tokuhashi and Tomita. Overall survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Using the log rank test and Cox regression model we assessed the value of the individual components of each scoring system for predicting survival in these patients. RESULT The factors that were most significantly associated with survival were the general condition score (Karnofsky Performance Scale) (P=.000, log rank test), metastasis to internal organs (P=.0002 log rank test), and number of extraspinal bone metastases (P=.0058). Type of primary tumor was not found to be significantly associated with survival according to the revised Tokuhashi scoring system (P=.9131, log rank test). Stepwise logistic regression revealed that the Tomita score correlated more closely with survival than the Tokuhashi score. CONCLUSION The patient's performance status, extent of visceral metastasis, and extent of bone metastases are significant predictors of survival in patients with metastatic disease. Both revised Tokuhashi and Tomita scores were significantly correlated with survival. A revised Tokuhashi score of 7 or more and a Tomita score of 6 or less indicated >50% chance of surviving 6 months postoperatively. We recommend that the Tomita score be used for prognostication in patients who are contemplating surgery, as it is simpler to score and has a higher strength of correlation with survival than the Tokuhashi score."

STUDY DESIGN We conducted a prospective cohort study of 448 patients with spinal metastases from a variety of cancer groups. OBJECTIVE To determine the specific predictive value of the Tokuhashi scoring system (T12) and its revised version (T15) in spinal metastases of various primary tumors. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA The life expectancy of patients with spinal metastases is one of the most important factors in selecting the treatment modality. Tokuhashi et al formulated a prognostic scoring system with a total sum of 12 points for preoperative prediction of life expectancy in 1990 and revised it in 2005 to a total sum of 15 points. There is a lack of knowledge about the specific predictive value of those scoring systems in patients with spinal metastases from a variety of cancer groups. METHODS We included 448 patients with vertebral metastases who underwent surgical treatment during November 1992 to November 2009 in Aarhus University Hospital NBG. Data were retrieved from Aarhus Metastases Database. Scores based on T12 and T15 were calculated prospectively for each patient. We divided all the patients into different groups dictated by the site of their primary tumor. Predictive value and accuracy rate of the 2 scoring systems were compared in each cancer group. RESULTS Both the T12 and T15 scoring systems showed statistically significant predictive value when the 448 patients were analyzed in total (T12, P < 0.0001; T15, P < 0.0001). The accuracy rate was significantly higher in T15 (P < 0.0001) than in T12. The further analyses by primary cancer groups showed that the predictive value of T12 and T15 was primarily determined by the prostate (P = 0.0003) and breast group (P = 0.0385). Only T12 displayed predictive value in the colon group (P = 0.0011). Neither of the scoring systems showed significant predictive value in the lung (P > 0.05), renal (P > 0.05), or miscellaneous primary tumor groups (P > 0.05). The accuracy rate of prognosis in T15 was significantly improved in the prostate (P = 0.0032) and breast group (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Both T12 and T15 showed significant predictive value in patients with spinal metastases. T15 has a statistically higher accuracy rate than T12. Among the various cancer groups, the 2 scoring systems are especially reliable in prostate and breast metastases groups. T15 is recommended as superior to T12 because of its higher accuracy rate."

BACKGROUND One of the most important selection criteria for spinal metastases surgery is life expectancy and the most important system for this prediction has been proposed by Tokuhashi. The aim of this study was to evaluate predictive value of the Tokuhashi score for life expectancy in Iranian patients with spinal metastases one year after diagnosis. METHODS From February 2007 to March 2009, of 180 patients suffering spinal metastatic tumors, 71 patients were excluded. This left a study population of 109 patients with known malignant metastases to spine (56 females and 53 males; mean age, 57 \u00b1 12 years). Tokuhashi revised evaluation system for the prognosis of metastatic spinal tumors was used for all patients. The survival period predicted by this system for the prognosis and the actual survival period after 1 year follow up were evaluated. RESULTS The predicted survival according to Tokuhashi prognostic scoring system was less than 6 months in 38(34.9%) patients, 6-12 months in 39(35.8%) patients and 1 year or more in 32(29.4%) patients. 39 (35.8%) patients died at first six-month of the follow up, 28(25.7%) patients at the second six-month period and 42(38.5%) patients were alive at the end of the year. There was no significant difference between predicted and actual survival time (p = 0.116). CONCLUSIONS Present study showed that the Tokuhashi revised scoring system may be practicable and highly predictive preoperative scoring system for patients with spinal metastases in Iran."

BACKGROUND We sought to identify preoperative factors significantly correlated with survival. We also aimed to evaluate the validity of the prognostic scores in the Tomita and Tokuhashi systems and discuss several aspects to improve the predictive accuracy of these systems. Moreover, we suggest modified criteria for selecting treatment strategies. METHODS In total, the outcomes of 112 patients with spinal metastasis who underwent surgery between January 2006 and June 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The validity of the prognostic scores was assessed on the basis of their correlation with survival. For various primary malignancies, new scoring criteria were applied in each system according to the survival results obtained in this study. Each revised scoring system was adjusted with a similar principle of scoring as described previously. Patient survival according to each preoperative factor was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The predictive value of each scoring system was evaluated by the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS The interval from the diagnosis of the primary malignancy to that of spinal metastasis (p = 0.023) and the interval from the diagnosis of spinal metastasis to surgery (p = 0.039) were significantly correlated with survival. Regarding Tokuhashi scores, the correlation coefficient was 0.790 before adjustment (p = 0.001) and 0.853 after adjustment (p < 0.001). For Tomita scores, the correlation coefficient was -0.994 (p < 0.001) both before and after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS Tomita scores more accurately predicted survival than Tokuhashi scores. It is helpful to evaluate both scoring systems with adjustment for primary malignancy depending on the clinical setting. Patients with Tomita scores less than or equal to 8 and Tokuhashi scores greater than or equal to 6 are recommended to undergo surgical management."

As a result, 236 articles were extracted. Those referring to representative scoring systems about predicting the survival of patients with metastatic spine tumors were used. The significance and limits of these scoring systems, and the future perspectives were described. Tokuhashi score, Tomita score, Baur score, Linden score, Rades score, and Katagiri score were introduced. They are all scoring systems prepared by combining factors that affect prognosis. The primary site of cancer and visceral metastasis were common factors in all of these scoring systems. Other factors selected to influence the prognosis varied. They were useful to roughly predict the survival period, such as, \"more than one year or not\" or \"more than six months or not\". In particular, they were utilized for decision-making about operative indications and avoidance of excessive medical treatment. Because the function depended on the survival period in the patients with metastatic spine tumor, it was also utilized in assessing functional prognosis. However, no scoring system had more than 90% consistency between the predicted and actual survival periods. Future perspectives should adopt more oncological viewpoints with adjustment of the process of treatment for metastatic spine tumor."

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE Clinically, whether and how to make a surgical interventional decision for the patients with spinal metastases is still controversial. Life expectancy is a significant determinant in the selection of surgical procedure for spinal metastases. This study was to evaluate Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems in selecting surgical procedure and predicting prognosis of extradural spinal metastases. METHODS A total of 169 patients with spinal metastases, treated in the Spine Unit of Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, from Jan. 2001 to Apr. 2004, were enrolled. The life expectancy was scored according to both Tomita system and Tokuhashi system before operation, the spinal metastases were classified according to Tomita system, and the patients underwent surgery accordingly. Follow-up was done 6, 12, and 24 months after operation. The precise of Tomita system and Tokuhashi system in estimating \"death within 3 months\", \"death within 6 months\", and \"death within 12 months\" was compared using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC curves). The mean survival time of the patients was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS ROC curves of \"death within 3 months\", \"death within 6 months\", and \"death within 12 months\" showed no significant difference between Tomita score and Tokuhashi score in each group (P = 0.16, P = 0.47, and P = 0.38, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that Tomita system overestimated the prognosis in scores from 4 to 7, and Tokuhashi system underestimated the prognosis in scores from 0 to 8. CONCLUSIONS Both Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems could be used to predict prognosis of spinal metastases after operation. Tokuhashi scoring system can predict early death more accurately, which can be used to avoid major operation for these patients."

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become an intriguing approach for neurological disease modeling, because neural lineage-specific cell types that retain the donors' complex genetics can be established in vitro. The statistical power of these iPSC-based models, however, is dependent on accurate diagnoses of the somatic cell donors; unfortunately, many neurodegenerative diseases are commonly misdiagnosed in live human subjects. Postmortem histopathological examination of a donor's brain, combined with premortem clinical criteria, is often the most robust approach to correctly classify an individual as a disease-specific case or unaffected control. In this study, we describe iPSCs generated from a skin biopsy collected postmortem during the rapid autopsy of a 75-year-old male, whole body donor, defined as an unaffected neurological control by both clinical and histopathological criteria. These iPSCs were established in a feeder-free system by lentiviral transduction of the Yamanaka factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Selected iPSC clones expressed both nuclear and surface antigens recognized as pluripotency markers of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and were able to differentiate in vitro into neurons and glia. Statistical analysis also demonstrated that fibroblast proliferation was significantly affected by biopsy site, but not donor age (within an elderly cohort). These results provide evidence that autopsy donor-derived fibroblasts can be successfully reprogrammed into iPSCs, and may provide an advantageous approach for generating iPSC-based neurological disease models."

Through the ectopic expression of four transcription factors, Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and cMyc, human somatic cells can be converted to a pluripotent state, generating so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)(1-4). Patient-specific iPSCs lack the ethical concerns that surround embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and would bypass possible immune rejection. Thus, iPSCs have attracted considerable attention for disease modeling studies, the screening of pharmacological compounds, and regenerative therapies(5). We have shown the generation of transgene-free human iPSCs from patients with different lung diseases using a single excisable polycistronic lentiviral Stem Cell Cassette (STEMCCA) encoding the Yamanaka factors(6). These iPSC lines were generated from skin fibroblasts, the most common cell type used for reprogramming. Normally, obtaining fibroblasts requires a skin punch biopsy followed by expansion of the cells in culture for a few passages. Importantly, a number of groups have reported the reprogramming of human peripheral blood cells into iPSCs(7-9). In one study, a Tet inducible version of the STEMCCA vector was employed(9), which required the blood cells to be simultaneously infected with a constitutively active lentivirus encoding the reverse tetracycline transactivator. In contrast to fibroblasts, peripheral blood cells can be collected via minimally invasive procedures, greatly reducing the discomfort and distress of the patient. A simple and effective protocol for reprogramming blood cells using a constitutive single excisable vector may accelerate the application of iPSC technology by making it accessible to a broader research community. Furthermore, reprogramming of peripheral blood cells allows for the generation of iPSCs from individuals in which skin biopsies should be avoided (i.e. aberrant scarring) or due to pre-existing disease conditions preventing access to punch biopsies. Here we demonstrate a protocol for the generation of human iPSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using a single floxed-excisable lentiviral vector constitutively expressing the 4 factors. Freshly collected or thawed PBMCs are expanded for 9 days as described(10,11) in medium containing ascorbic acid, SCF, IGF-1, IL-3 and EPO before being transduced with the STEMCCA lentivirus. Cells are then plated onto MEFs and ESC-like colonies can be visualized two weeks after infection. Finally, selected clones are expanded and tested for the expression of the pluripotency markers SSEA-4, Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81. This protocol is simple, robust and highly consistent, providing a reliable methodology for the generation of human iPSCs from readily accessible 4 ml of blood."

The ability to efficiently generate integration-free induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the most readily available source-peripheral blood-has the potential to expedite the advances of iPSC-based therapies. We have successfully generated integration-free iPSCs from cord blood (CB) CD34(+) cells with improved oriP/EBNA1-based episomal vectors (EV) using a strong spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. Here we show that Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, MYC, and KLF4)-expressing EV can also reprogram adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) into pluripotency, yet at a very low efficiency. We found that inclusion of BCL-XL increases the reprogramming efficiency by approximately 10-fold. Furthermore, culture of CD3(-)/CD19(-) cells or T/B cell-depleted MNCs for 4-6 days led to the generation of 20-30 iPSC colonies from 1 ml PB, an efficiency that is substantially higher than previously reported. PB iPSCs express pluripotency markers, form teratomas, and can be induced to differentiate in vitro into mesenchymal stem cells, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes. Used together, our optimized factor combination and reprogramming strategy lead to efficient generation of integration-free iPSCs from adult PB. This discovery has potential applications in iPSC banking, disease modeling and regenerative medicine."

Residual reprogramming transgene expression from integrated viruses nevertheless alters the biological properties of iPSCs and has been associated with a reduced developmental competence both in vivo and in vitro. We performed transcriptional profiling of mouse iPSC lines before and after excision of a polycistronic lentiviral reprogramming vector to systematically define the overall impact of persistent transgene expression on the molecular features of iPSCs. We demonstrate that residual expression of the Yamanaka factors prevents iPSCs from acquiring the transcriptional program exhibited by embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and that the expression profiles of iPSCs generated with and without c-Myc are indistinguishable. After vector excision, we find 36% of iPSC clones show normal methylation of the Gtl2 region, an imprinted locus that marks ESC-equivalent iPSC lines. Furthermore, we show that the reprogramming factor Klf4 binds to the promoter region of Gtl2. Regardless of Gtl2 methylation status, we find similar endodermal and hepatocyte differentiation potential comparing syngeneic Gtl2(ON) vs Gtl2(OFF) iPSC clones.

Here, we report that Sox2 directly regulates endogenous microRNA-29b (miR-29b) expression during iPSC generation and that miR-29b expression is required for OSKM- and OSK-mediated reprogramming.

Moreover, the effect of miR-29b on reprogramming can be blocked by Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b overexpression. Further experiments indicate that miR-29b-DNMT signaling is significantly involved in the regulation of DNA methylation-related reprogramming events, such as mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and Dlk1-Dio3 region transcription. Thus, our studies not only reveal that miR-29b is a novel mediator of reprogramming factor Sox2 but also provide evidence for a multistep mechanism in which Sox2 drives a miR-29b-DNMT signaling axis that regulates DNA methylation-related events during reprogramming."

The recently established reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Takahashi and Yamanaka represents a valuable tool for future therapeutic applications. To date, the mechanisms underlying this process are still largely unknown. In particular, the mechanisms how the Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) directly drive reprogramming and which additional components are involved are still not yet understood. In this study, we aimed at analyzing the role of ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like one (Artd1; formerly called poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 [Parp1]) during reprogramming. We found that poly(ADP-ribosylation) (PARylation) of the reprogramming factor Sox2 by Artd1 plays an important role during the first days upon transduction with the reprogramming factors. A process that happens before Artd1 in conjunction with 10-11 translocation-2 (Tet2) mediates the histone modifications necessary for the establishment of an activated chromatin state at pluripotency loci (e.g., Nanog and Essrb) [Nature 2012;488:652-655]. Wild-type (WT) fibroblasts treated with an Artd1 inhibitor as well as fibroblasts deficient for Artd1 (Artd1-/-) show strongly decreased reprogramming capacity. Our data indicate that Artd1-mediated PARylation of Sox2 favors its binding to the fibroblast growth factor 4 (Fgf4) enhancer, thereby activating Fgf4 expression. The importance of Fgf4 during the first 4 days upon initiation of reprogramming was also highlighted by the observation that exogenous addition of Fgf4 was sufficient to restore the reprogramming capacity of Artd1-/- fibroblast to WT levels. In conclusion, our data clearly show that the interaction between Artd1 and Sox2 is crucial for the first steps of the reprogramming process and that early expression of Fgf4 (day 2 to day 4) is an essential component for the successful generation of iPSCs."

BACKGROUND Although recent studies have identified genes expressed in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that induce pluripotency, the molecular underpinnings of normal stem cell function remain poorly understood. The high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) gene is highly expressed in hESCs and poorly differentiated, stem-like cancers; however, its role in these settings has been unclear. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We show that HMGA1 is highly expressed in fully reprogrammed iPSCs and hESCs, with intermediate levels in ECCs and low levels in fibroblasts. When hESCs are induced to differentiate, HMGA1 decreases and parallels that of other pluripotency factors. Conversely, forced expression of HMGA1 blocks differentiation of hESCs. We also discovered that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs together with the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC - OSKM). HMGA1 increases the number and size of iPSC colonies compared to OSKM controls. Surprisingly, there was normal differentiation in vitro and benign teratoma formation in vivo of the HMGA1-derived iPSCs. During the reprogramming process, HMGA1 induces the expression of pluripotency genes, including SOX2, LIN28, and cMYC, while knockdown of HMGA1 in hESCs results in the repression of these genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that HMGA1 binds to the promoters of these pluripotency genes in vivo. In addition, interfering with HMGA1 function using a short hairpin RNA or a dominant-negative construct blocks cellular reprogramming to a pluripotent state. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate for the first time that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming from a somatic cell to a fully pluripotent stem cell. These findings identify a novel role for HMGA1 as a key regulator of the stem cell state by inducing transcriptional networks that drive pluripotency. Although further studies are needed, these HMGA1 pathways could be exploited in regenerative medicine or as novel therapeutic targets for poorly differentiated, stem-like cancers."

We demonstrate here the existence of multiple Pfh1p isoforms that localized to either nuclei or mitochondria. The catalytic activity of Pfh1p was essential in both cellular compartments. The absence of nuclear Pfh1p resulted in G(2) arrest and accumulation of DNA damage foci, a finding suggestive of an essential role in DNA replication. Exogenous DNA damage resulted in localization of Pfh1p to DNA damage foci, suggesting that nuclear Pfh1p also functions in DNA repair. The absence of mitochondrial Pfh1p caused rapid depletion of mitochondrial DNA. Despite localization to nuclei and mitochondria in S. pombe, neither of the S. cerevisiae homologs, nor human PIF1, suppressed the lethality of pfh1Delta cells. However, the essential nuclear function of Pfh1p could be supplied by Rrm3p. Expression of Rrm3p suppressed the accumulation of DNA damage foci but not the hydroxyurea sensitivity of cells depleted of nuclear Pfh1p.

The intra-S phase checkpoint protein complex Tof1/Csm3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae antagonizes Rrm3 helicase to modulate replication fork arrest not only at the replication termini of rDNA but also at strong nonhistone protein binding sites throughout the genome. We investigated whether these checkpoint proteins acted either antagonistically or synergistically with Rrm3 in mediating other important functions such as maintenance of genome stability. High retromobility of a normally quiescent retrovirus-like transposable element Ty1 of S. cerevisiae is a form of genome instability, because the transposition events induce mutations. We measured the transposition of Ty1 in various genetic backgrounds and discovered that Tof1 suppressed excessive retromobility in collaboration with either Rrm3 or the F-box protein Dia2. Although both Rrm3 and Dia2 are believed to facilitate fork movement, fork stalling at DNA-protein complexes did not appear to be a major contributor to enhancement of retromobility. Absence of the aforementioned proteins either individually or in pair-wise combinations caused karyotype changes as revealed by the altered migrations of the individual chromosomes in pulsed field gels. The mobility changes were RNase H-resistant and therefore, unlikely to have been caused by extensive R loop formation. These mutations also resulted in alterations of telomere lengths. However, the latter changes could not fully account for the magnitude of the observed karyotypic alterations. We conclude that unlike other checkpoint proteins that are known to be required for elevated retromobility, Tof1 suppressed high frequency retrotransposition and maintained karyotype stability in collaboration with the aforementioned proteins."

Termination of replication forks at the natural termini of the rDNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled in a sequence-specific and polar mode by the interaction of the Fob1p replication terminator protein with the tandem Ter sites located in the nontranscribed spacers. Here we show, by both 2D gel analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP), that there exists a second level of global control mediated by the intra-S-phase checkpoint protein complex of Tof1p and Csm3p that protect stalled forks at Ter sites against the activity of the Rrm3p helicase (\"sweepase\"). The sweepase tends to release arrested forks presumably by the transient displacement of the Ter-bound Fob1p. Consistent with this mechanism, very few replication forks were arrested at the natural replication termini in the absence of the two checkpoint proteins. In the absence of the Rrm3p helicase, there was a slight enhancement of fork arrest at the Ter sites. Simultaneous deletions of the TOF1 (or CSM3), and the RRM3 genes restored fork arrest by removing both the fork-releasing and fork-protection activities. Other genes such as MRC1, WSS1, and PSY2 that are also involved in the MRC1 checkpoint pathway were not involved in this global control. This observation suggests that Tof1p-Csm3p function differently from MRC1 and the other above-mentioned genes. This mechanism is not restricted to the natural Ter sites but was also observed at fork arrest caused by the meeting of a replication fork with transcription approaching from the opposite direction."

We explored the connection between DNA replication and Ty1 retromobility by investigating the basis of increased retromobility in an rrm3 mutant. Even though Ty1 cDNA levels are increased in the absence of RRM3, neither the level nor target-site specificity of cDNA integration was altered. Instead, cDNA was incorporated into the genome by a Rad52-dependent mechanism that did not involve gene conversion of genomic Ty1 sequences. In rrm3 isolates, incorporated cDNA was often present in tandem arrays. Multimeric cDNA arrays probably arise during chromosomal break repair, since their appearance was strongly correlated with the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements. Moreover, Ty1 multimers were invariantly located on rearranged chromosomes, when present. Overexpression of a cellular RNase H, which degrades RNA in an RNA:DNA hybrid, completely suppressed the increase in Ty1 multimer formation in an rrm3 mutant. We propose that RNA:DNA hybrid regions within nascent retrotransposition events block replication in an rrm3 mutant, leading to chromosome breaks within Ty1 sequences. Multiple extragenomic Ty1 cDNA molecules are then used as donors in recombinational repair of the break before it is healed."

How the cellular amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is regulated under normal conditions and in the presence of genotoxic stress is less understood. We demonstrate that the inefficient mtDNA replication process of mutant yeast cells lacking the PIF1 DNA helicase is partly rescued in the absence of the DNA helicase RRM3. The rescue effect is likely due to the increase in the deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) pool caused by the lack of RRM3. In contrast, the Pif1p-dependent mtDNA breakage in the presence and absence of genotoxic stress is not suppressed if RRM3 is lacking suggesting that this phenotype is likely independent of the dNTP pool. Pif1 protein (Pif1p) was found to stimulate the incorporation of dNTPs into newly synthesised mtDNA of gradient-purified mitochondria. We propose that Pif1p that acts likely as a DNA helicase in mitochondria affects mtDNA replication directly. Possible roles of Pif1p include the resolution of secondary DNA and/or DNA/RNA structures, the temporarily displacement of tightly bound mtDNA-binding proteins, or the stabilization of the mitochondrial replication complex during mtDNA replication."

Its absence leads to increased fork stalling and breakage at over 1,000 specific sites located throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. To understand the mechanisms that respond to and repair rrm3-dependent lesions, we carried out a candidate gene deletion analysis to identify genes whose mutation conferred slow growth or lethality on rrm3 cells. Based on synthetic phenotypes, the intra-S-phase checkpoint, the SRS2 inhibitor of recombination, the SGS1/TOP3 replication fork restart pathway, and the MRE11/RAD50/XRS2 (MRX) complex were critical for viability of rrm3 cells. DNA damage checkpoint and homologous recombination genes were important for normal growth of rrm3 cells. However, the MUS81/MMS4 replication fork restart pathway did not affect growth of rrm3 cells. These data suggest a model in which the stalled and broken forks generated in rrm3 cells activate a checkpoint response that provides time for fork repair and restart. Stalled forks are converted by a Rad51p-mediated process to intermediates that are resolved by Sgs1p/Top3p.

Disassembly of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery from biological membranes is a critical final step in cellular processes that require the ESCRT function. This reaction is catalyzed by VPS4, an AAA-ATPase whose activity is tightly regulated by a host of proteins, including LIP5 and the ESCRT-III proteins. Here, we present structural and functional analyses of molecular interactions between human VPS4, LIP5, and the ESCRT-III proteins. The N-terminal domain of LIP5 (LIP5NTD) is required for LIP5-mediated stimulation of VPS4, and the ESCRT-III protein CHMP5 strongly inhibits the stimulation. Both of these observations are distinct from what was previously described for homologous yeast proteins. The crystal structure of LIP5NTD in complex with the MIT (microtubule-interacting and transport)-interacting motifs of CHMP5 and a second ESCRT-III protein, CHMP1B, was determined at 1 \u00c5 resolution. It reveals an ESCRT-III binding induced moderate conformational change in LIP5NTD, which results from insertion of a conserved CHMP5 tyrosine residue (Tyr(182)) at the core of LIP5NTD structure. Mutation of Tyr(182) partially relieves the inhibition displayed by CHMP5. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism of VPS4 regulation in metazoans, where CHMP5 functions as a negative allosteric switch to control LIP5-mediated stimulation of VPS4."

Chmp4b, a protein that is required to mediate particle scission, is recruited to HIV-1 assembly sites \u223c10 s before the ATPase Vps4A.

Recently it was shown that both recycling endosome and endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) components are required for cytokinesis, in which they are believed to act in a sequential manner to bring about secondary ingression and abscission, respectively. However, it is not clear how either of these complexes is targeted to the midbody and whether their delivery is coordinated. The trafficking of membrane vesicles between different intracellular organelles involves the formation of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. Although membrane traffic is known to play an important role in cytokinesis, the contribution and identity of intracellular SNAREs to cytokinesis remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that syntaxin 16 is a key regulator of cytokinesis, as it is required for recruitment of both recycling endosome-associated Exocyst and ESCRT machinery during late telophase, and therefore that these two distinct facets of cytokinesis are inextricably linked."

The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning. Acetylation of the \u03b5-amino group of Lys-40 of \u03b1-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 as well as its depletion enhance microtubule acetylation, only pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity leads to an increase in microtubule stability against cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerizing conditions. Tubastatin A treatment suppressed the dynamics of individual microtubules in MCF-7 cells and delayed the reassembly of depolymerized microtubules. Interestingly, both the localization of HDAC6 on microtubules and the amount of HDAC6 associated with polymeric fraction of tubulin were found to increase in the tubastatin A-treated cells compared with the control cells, suggesting that the pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 enhances the binding of HDAC6 to microtubules. The evidence presented in this study indicated that the increased binding of HDAC6, rather than the acetylation per se, causes microtubule stability. The results are in support of a hypothesis that in addition to its deacetylase function, HDAC6 might function as a MAP that regulates microtubule dynamics under certain conditions."

In this study, angiotensin II induced disassembly and deacetylation of \u03b1-tubulin, which were blocked by pretreatment with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and a sirtuin class deacetylase inhibitor sirtinol, and by depletion of a deacetylase SIRT2 using RNA interference. We investigated the involvement of SIRT2 in angiotensin II-induced endothelial cell migration using the Boyden chamber method. Angiotensin II caused a significant increase in cell migration, which was blocked by pretreatment with sirtinol and SIRT2 depletion. It has been reported that angiotensin II is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization stimulated by mechanical stretch in endothelial cells. We also demonstrated that endothelial cells subjected to a 10% uniaxial stretch showed vertical alignment to the direction of tension and tubulin deacetylation in the peripheral side of cells, in comparison with control static cells. The mechanical stretch-induced changes of microtubules were blocked by pretreatment with sirtinol and SIRT2 depletion. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that acetylated tubulin was decreased in platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive cells in the intima of the aortic walls in mice loaded with angiotensin II, in comparison with mice loaded with control vehicle.

These mice also show resistance to axonal degeneration caused by microtubule depolymerizing drugs, suggesting that axonal microtubules are stabilized. Here, we have focused on tubulin acetylation, a post-translational modification associated with microtubule stability. We found that the basal level of microtubule acetylation was increased in cultured cerebellar granule cells from Wld(S) mice. Nicotinamide but not 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor for poly(ADP)ribose polymerase, enhanced tubulin acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in cultured cerebellar granule cells from wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting that mammalian Sir2-related protein (SIRT) 2, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)--dependent tubulin deacetylase, could modulate resistance to axonal degeneration.

Moreover, SIRT2 overexpression abrogated microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in these cells. Conversely, SIRT2 knockdown by using a lentiviral vector expressing small interfering RNA, enhanced microtubule acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in WT granule cells.

Neurotensin (NT), an intestinal peptide secreted from N cells in the small bowel, regulates a variety of physiological functions of the gastrointestinal tract, including secretion, gut motility, and intestinal growth. The class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) family, which comprised of p110 catalytic (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b4) and p85 regulatory subunits, has been implicated in the regulation of hormone secretion from endocrine cells. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In particular, the role of PI3K in intestinal peptide secretion is not known. Here, we show that PI3K catalytic subunit, p110\u03b1, negatively regulates NT secretion in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that inhibition of p110\u03b1, but not p110\u03b2, induces NT release in BON, a human endocrine cell line, which expresses NT mRNA and produces NT peptide in a manner analogous to N cells, and QGP-1, a pancreatic endocrine cell line that produces NT peptide. In contrast, overexpression of p110\u03b1 decreases NT secretion. Consistently, p110\u03b1-inhibition increases plasma NT levels in mice. To further delineate the mechanisms contributing to this effect, we demonstrate that inhibition of p110\u03b1 increases NT granule trafficking by up-regulating \u03b1-tubulin acetylation; NT secretion is prevented by overexpression of HDAC6, an \u03b1-tubulin deacetylase. Moreover, ras-related protein Rab27A (a small G protein) and kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa (Kidins220), which are associated with NT granules, play a negative and positive role, respectively, in p110\u03b1-inhibition-induced NT secretion.

Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is dependent on \u03b1-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant \u03b1-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with enhanced activity on acetylated \u03b1-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of \u03b1-tubulin acetylation initiates cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting \u03b1-tubulin severing by katanin which, in turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological transition toward mature adipocytes."

BACKGROUND Histone acetylation of chromatin plays a key role in promoting the dynamic transcriptional responses in neurons that influence the neuroplasticity linked to cognitive ability, yet the specific histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that create such epigenetic marks remain to be elucidated. METHODS AND FINDINGS Here we use the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a well-characterized synapse model to identify HATs that control synaptic remodeling and structure. We show that the HAT dTip60 is concentrated both pre and post-synaptically within the NMJ. Presynaptic targeted reduction of dTip60 HAT activity causes a significant increase in synaptic bouton number that specifically affects type Is boutons. The excess boutons show a suppression of the active zone synaptic function marker bruchpilot, suggesting defects in neurotransmission function. Analysis of microtubule organization within these excess boutons using immunohistochemical staining to the microtubule associated protein futsch reveals a significant increase in the rearrangement of microtubule loop architecture that is required for bouton division. Moreover, \u03b1-tubulin acetylation levels of microtubules specifically extending into the terminal synaptic boutons are reduced in response to dTip60 HAT reduction. CONCLUSIONS Our results are the first to demonstrate a causative role for the HAT dTip60 in the control of synaptic plasticity that is achieved, at least in part, via regulation of the synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton. These findings have implications for dTip60 HAT dependant epigenetic mechanisms underlying cognitive function."

UNLABELLED We have been using polarized, hepatic WIF-B cells to examine ethanol-induced liver injury. These cells polarize in culture and maintain numerous liver-specific activities including the ability to metabolize alcohol. Previously, we found that microtubules were more highly acetylated and more stable in ethanol-treated WIF-B cells and that increased microtubule acetylation required ethanol metabolism and was likely mediated by acetaldehyde. This study was aimed at identifying the mechanism responsible for increased microtubule acetylation. We examined the expression of two known microtubule deacetylases, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and Sirtuin T2 (SirT2), in WIF-B cells. Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and assays using the SirT2 inhibitor nicotinamide revealed that WIF-B cells do not express SirT2. In contrast, HDAC6 was highly expressed in WIF-B cells. Addition of trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC6 inhibitor, induced microtubule acetylation to the same extent as in ethanol-treated cells (approximately threefold). Although immunofluorescence labeling revealed that HDAC6 distribution did not change in ethanol-treated cells, immunoblotting showed HDAC6 protein levels slightly decreased. HDAC6 solubility was increased in nocodazole-treated cells, suggesting impaired microtubule binding. Direct microtubule binding assays confirmed this hypothesis. The decreased microtubule binding was partially prevented by 4-methyl pyrazole, indicating the effect was in part mediated by acetaldehyde. Interestingly, HDAC6 from ethanol-treated cells was able to bind and deacetylate exogenous tubulin to the same extent as control, suggesting that ethanol-induced tubulin modifications prevented HDAC6 binding to endogenous microtubules. CONCLUSION We propose that lower HDAC6 levels combined with decreased microtubule binding lead to increased tubulin acetylation in ethanol-treated cells."

The human HDAC (histone deacetylase) family, a well-validated anticancer target, plays a key role in the control of gene expression through regulation of transcription.

To address the above issues, we have tested a number of clinically relevant HDACis (HDAC inhibitors) against a panel of rhHDAC (recombinant human HDAC) isoforms. Eight rhHDACs were expressed using a baculoviral system, and a Fluor de Lystrade mark (Biomol International) HDAC assay was optimized for each purified isoform. The potency and selectivity of ten HDACs on class I isoforms (rhHDAC1, rhHDAC2, rhHDAC3 and rhHDAC8) and class II HDAC isoforms (rhHDAC4, rhHDAC6, rhHDAC7 and rhHDAC9) was determined.

The growth-inhibitory effect of the HDACis on HeLa cells showed that both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitors inhibited cell growth. The results also showed that both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitor treatment resulted in increased acetylation of histones, but only pan-HDAC inhibitor treatment resulted in increased tubulin acetylation, which is in agreement with their activity towards the HDAC6 isoform."

Inhibition of HDAC6 results in higher levels of acetylated tubulin and enhanced binding of the motor protein kinesin-1 to tubulin, which promotes transport of cargoes along microtubules. Microtubule-dependent intracellular trafficking may therefore be regulated by modulating the activity of HDAC6. We have shown previously that the neuromodulator serotonin increases mitochondrial movement in hippocampal neurons via the Akt-GSK3beta signaling pathway. Here, we demonstrate a role for HDAC6 in this signaling pathway. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We found that the presence of tubacin, a specific HDAC6 inhibitor, dramatically enhanced mitochondrial movement in hippocampal neurons, whereas niltubacin, an inactive tubacin analog, had no effect. Compared to control cultures, higher levels of acetylated tubulin were found in neurons treated with tubacin, and more kinesin-1 was associated with mitochondria isolated from these neurons. Inhibition of GSK3beta decreased cytoplasmic deacetylase activity and increased tubulin acetylation, whereas blockade of Akt, which phosphorylates and down-regulates GSK3beta, increased cytoplasmic deacetylase activity and decreased tubulin acetylation. Concordantly, the administration of 5-HT, 8-OH-DPAT (a specific 5-HT1A receptor agonist), or fluoxetine (a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor) increased tubulin acetylation. GSK3beta was found to co-localize with HDAC6 in hippocampal neurons, and inhibition of GSK3beta resulted in decreased binding of antibody to phosphoserine-22, a potential GSK3beta phosphorylation site in HDAC6. GSK3beta may therefore regulate HDAC6 activity by phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE This study demonstrates that HDAC6 plays an important role in the modulation of mitochondrial transport. The link between HDAC6 and GSK3beta, established here, has important implications for our understanding of neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, abnormal mitochondrial transport, which has been observed in such disorders as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, could result from the misregulation of HDAC6 by GSK3beta. HDAC6 may therefore constitute an attractive target in the treatment of these disorders."

Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components. Microtubule dynamics can be modulated by posttranslational modifications to tubulin subunits. Acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered \u03b1-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin in different species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the cerebral cortex during development. MEC-17 deficiency caused migratory defects in the cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and perturbed the transition of projection neurons from the multipolar stage to the unipolar/bipolar stage in the intermediate zone of the cortex. Furthermore, knockdown of \u03b1-tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 or overexpression of tubulin(K40Q) to mimic acetylated \u03b1-tubulin could reduce the migratory and morphological defects caused by MEC-17 deficiency in cortical projection neurons. Thus, MEC-17, which regulates the acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin, appears to control the migration and morphological transition of cortical neurons.

To examine the effect of p38 MAP kinase inhibition on growth properties and apoptosis in telomerase-inhibited cells, we cultured DN-hTERT-expressing U937 cells with or without SB203580. Dominant-negative-hTERT-expressing U937 cells stopped proliferation on PD25; however, a significant increase in growth rate was observed in the presence of SB203580. Treatment of SB203580 also reduced the induction of apoptosis in DN-hTERT-expressing U937 cells (PD25). These results suggest that p38 MAP kinase has a critical role for the induction of apoptosis in telomerase-inhibited leukemia cells. Further, we evaluated the effect of telomestatin on the growth of U937 cells in xenograft mouse model. Systemic intraperitoneal administration of telomestatin in U937 xenografts decreased tumor telomerase levels and reduced tumor volumes. Tumor tissue from telomestatin-treated animals exhibited marked apoptosis. None of the mice treated with telomestatin displayed any signs of toxicity. Taken together, these results lay the foundations for a program of drug development to achieve the dual aims of efficacy and selectivity in vivo."

Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme maintaining the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes, is up-regulated in the vast majority of human neoplasias but not in normal somatic tissues. Therefore, the telomerase complex represents a promising universal therapeutic target in cancer. Telomeric G-rich single-stranded DNA can adopt in vitro an intramolecular quadruplex structure, which has been shown to inhibit telomerase activity. We examined G-quadruplex interactive agent, telomestatin (SOT-095), for its ability to inhibit the proliferation of human leukemia cells, including freshly obtained leukemia cells. Telomere length was determined by either the terminal restriction fragment method or flow-FISH, and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Moreover, chemosensitivity was examined in telomestatin-treated U937 cells before ultimate telomere shortening. Treatment with telomestatin reproducibly inhibited telomerase activity in U937 and NB4 cells followed by telomere shortening. Enhanced chemosensitivity toward daunorubicin and cytosine-arabinoside was observed in telomestatin-treated U937 cells, before ultimate telomere shortening. Telomere shortening associated with apoptosis by telomestatin was evident in some freshly obtained leukemia cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients, regardless of sub-types of AML and post-myelodysplasia AML. These results suggest that disruption of telomere maintenance by telomestatin limits the cellular lifespan of AML cells, as well. However, in a minority of AML patients apoptosis was not evident, thus indicating that resistant mechanism might exist in some freshly obtained AML cells. Therefore, further investigation of telomestatin as a therapeutic agent is warranted."

We identified a G-rich sequence within exon 3 of BACE1 involved in controlling splice site selection. Mutation of the G-rich sequence decreased use of the normal 5' splice site of exon 3, which leads to full-length and proteolytically active BACE1, and increased use of an alternative splice site, which leads to a shorter, essentially inactive isoform. Nuclease protection assays, nuclear magnetic resonance, and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that this sequence folds into a G-quadruplex structure. Several proteins were identified as capable of binding to the G-rich sequence, and one of these, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H, was found to regulate BACE1 exon 3 alternative splicing and in a manner dependent on the G-rich sequence. Knockdown of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H led to a decrease in the full-length BACE1 mRNA isoform as well as a decrease in A\u03b2 production from APP, suggesting new possibilities for therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer's disease."

Myocardial fibrosis is a key pathological change in a variety of heart diseases contributing to the development of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Recent studies have shown that relaxin prevents and reverses cardiac fibrosis. Endogenous expression of relaxin was elevated in the setting of heart disease; the extent of such up-regulation, however, is insufficient to exert compensatory actions, and the mechanism regulating relaxin expression is poorly defined. In the rat relaxin-1 (RLN1, Chr1) gene promoter region we found presence of repeated guanine (G)-rich sequences, which allowed formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes with the addition of a G-quadruplex interactive ligand berberine. The G-rich sequences and the G-quadruplexes were localized adjacent to the binding motif of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, which negatively regulates relaxin expression. Thus, we hypothesized that the formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes by berberine could influence relaxin expression. We found that berberine-induced formation of G-quadruplexes did increase relaxin gene expression measured at mRNA and protein levels. Formation of G-quadruplexes significantly reduced STAT3 binding to the promoter of relaxin gene. This was associated with consequent increase in the binding of RNA polymerase II and STAT5a to relaxin gene promoter. In cardiac fibroblasts and rats treated with angiotensin II, berberine was found to suppress fibroblast activation, collagen synthesis, and extent of cardiac fibrosis through up-regulating relaxin. The antifibrotic action of berberine in vitro and in vivo was similar to that by exogenous relaxin. Our findings document a novel therapeutic strategy for fibrosis through up-regulating expression of endogenous relaxin."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia were recently shown to be caused by expansion of a (GGGGCC)n\u00b7(GGCCCC)n repeat in the C9orf72 gene. Mutant r(GGGGCC)n-containing transcripts aggregate in nuclear foci possibly sequestering repeat-binding proteins, suggesting a toxic RNA pathogenesis. We demonstrate that the r(GGGGCC)n RNA but not the C-rich r(GGCCCC)n RNA forms extremely stable uni- and multimolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures (up to 95 \u00b0C). Multimolecular G-quadruplex formation is influenced by repeat number and RNA concentration. MBNL1, a splicing factor that is sequestered in myotonic dystrophy patients by binding to expanded r(CUG)n repeat hairpins, does not bind the C9orf72 repeats, but the splicing factor ASF/SF2 can bind the r(GGGGCC)n repeat.

We recently demonstrated that ADAM10 translation is repressed by its 5'-UTR and that in particular the first half of ADAM10 5'-UTR is responsible for translational repression. Here, we asked whether specific sequence motifs exist in the ADAM10 5'-UTR that are able to form complex secondary structures and thus potentially inhibit ADAM10 translation. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we demonstrate that a G-rich region between nucleotides 66 and 94 of the ADAM10 5'-UTR forms a highly stable, intramolecular, parallel G-quadruplex secondary structure under physiological conditions. Mutation of guanines in this sequence abrogates the formation of the G-quadruplex structure. Although the G-quadruplex structure efficiently inhibits translation of a luciferase reporter in in vitro translation assays and in living cells, inhibition of G-quadruplex formation fails to do so. Moreover, expression of ADAM10 was similarly repressed by the G-quadruplex. Mutation of the G-quadruplex motif results in a significant increase of ADAM10 levels and consequently APPs\u03b1 secretion.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Neuroprotection by antagonists of both L-type and N-type calcium channels occurs in in vivo models of ischemia. The site of action of calcium channel antagonists is unclear, however, and it is likely that a combination of vascular and direct neuronal actions occurs. We have investigated the effects of blocking neuronal calcium channels using an organotypic hippocampal-slice model of ischemia. METHODS Organotypic hippocampal-slice cultures prepared from 10-day-old rats were maintained in vitro for 14 days. Cultures were exposed to either 3 hours of oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) or 1 hour of combined oxygen and glucose deprivation (ischemia). Neuronal damage was quantified after 24 hours by propidium iodide fluorescence. RESULTS Three hours of anoxia produced damage exclusively in CAT pyramidal cells. This damage was prevented by preincubation with omega conotoxin MVIIA, a selective N-type calcium channel blocker, and omega conotoxin MVIIC, which blocks N-type and other presynaptic neuronal calcium channels. The dihydropyridine nifedipine and the mixed calcium channel blocker SB201823-A were not protective. Furthermore, if addition of conotoxin MVIIA was delayed until after the hypoxic episode, a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect was observed, with an IC50 of 50 nmol/L. In contrast to hypoxia, none of the compounds was neuroprotective in the model of oxygen-glucose deprivation, although it was determined that extracellular calcium was essential for the generation of ischemic damage. CONCLUSIONS These studies present clear evidence that neuroprotection by selective N-type calcium channel antagonists is mediated directly through neuronal calcium channels. In contrast, the neuroprotective effects of dihydropyridines may be mediated through vascular calcium channels or indirectly through actions in other brain regions."

Electrically-induced twitch responses of the prostatic segment of vas deferens (0.1 Hz, 65 V, 1 ms) are mainly due to the transient presynaptic release of ATP, which acts postsynaptically on non-adrenergic receptors to contract smooth muscle cells. These responses were fully blocked by nanomolar concentrations of the omega-conotoxins GVIA, MVIIA, and MVIIC, most likely by inhibiting Ca2+ entry through presynaptic N-type Ca2+ channels controlling the release of ATP. Repeated washout of the toxins allowed the recovery of contractions, except for omega-conotoxin GVIA, whose inhibitory effects remained unchanged for at least 60 min. In addition, micromolar concentrations of omega-conotoxin MVIIC were unable to protect against the irreversible inhibition of twitch contractions induced by nanomolar concentrations of omega-conotoxin GVIA. At low extracellular Ca2+ concentrations (1.5 mM), 20 nM of omega-conotoxin GVIA or MVIIA inhibited completely the twitch contractions in about 10 min. In 5 mM Ca2+ the blockade of twitch contractions after 10 min was 70% for both toxins. In 1.5 mM Ca2+ omega-conotoxin MVIIC (1 microM) inhibited completely the twitch contraction after 10 min. In 5 mM Ca2+ blockade developed very slowly and was very poor after 30 min, omega-conotoxin MVIIC depressed the response by only 20%. These results are compatible with the idea that the three omega-conotoxins block the purinergic neurotransmission of the vas deferens by acting on presynaptic N-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. However, omega-conotoxin MVIIC seems to bind to sites different from those recognised by omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA, which are markedly differentiated by their Ca2+ requirements for binding to their receptors."

The more the concentration of Ni(2+) increased, the greater the number of incidences and the late contracture areas which occurred. Late contracture did not seem to be due to the effects of acetylcholine, tachykinins, or other polypeptides, but disappeared in the absence of indomethacin. The NANC relaxant responses elicited by the low- and high-frequency EFS were inhibited by \u03c9-conotoxin MVIIA or Ni(2+), but unaffected by \u03c9-Agatoxin IVA, \u03c9-conotoxin MVIIC, and nifedipine.

Additionally, the number of binding sites for radioligands labelling L- ([3H]nitrendipine), N- ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIA) and P/Q-type ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIC) Ca2+ channels was assessed in the rat retina and, for further comparison, in the rat cortex. Incubation of isolated rat retinas with 100 microM NMDA produced a three-fold increase in the influx of 45Ca2+ that was completely blunted by MK-801, a NMDA receptor antagonist, and partially attenuated (approximately 20%) by tetrodotoxin, a Na+ channel blocker. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine reduced NMDA-stimulated Ca2+ influx in a dose-related fashion, with a maximum reduction of approximately 50%. Similar effects were observed with verapamil and diltiazem. Blockers of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels had no significant effect on the influx of Ca2+ evoked by NMDA. Co2+, a non-specific Ca2+ channel blocker, caused an inhibition of NMDA-stimulated Ca2+ influx similar to that of nifedipine. Therefore, of all voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, L-type channels appear to make the greatest contribution (up to 50%) to the NMDA-stimulated influx of Ca2+ into the isolated rat retina. This finding contrasts with evidence obtained in brain neurones supporting a role for L-, N- and P/Q-type channels in NMDA-evoked Ca2+ signals. A comparison of the number of radioligand binding sites associated with L-, N- or P/Q-type Ca2+ channels in the rat cortex and retina revealed that such a difference cannot be ascribed to a distinct expression pattern of these channels in both tissues, although some variations were found. Interestingly, a different affinity of [3H]nitrendipine for L-type Ca2+ channels in the rat retina and cortex was observed which may reflect the expression of different classes of L-type channels in these tissues.

Recently, two new members of the family of omega-conopeptides--MVIIC from the marine snail Conus magus and SVIB from Conus striatus--have been described. Binding and electrophysiological data suggest that these two peptides, in addition to interacting with N-type calcium channels, interact with a widely distributed receptor in neuronal membranes that is distinct from N-type channels. In this report we demonstrate through biochemical and pharmacological differentiation at individual receptor polypeptide resolution, by affinity cross-linking, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography, that SNX-230 (synthetic MVIIC) binds with high affinity to a calcium channel alpha 1 subunit distinct from the high-affinity alpha 1 target of SNX-111 (synthetic MVIIA). SNX-183 (synthetic SVIB) interacts with both alpha 1 subunits with lower affinity. Whereas the alpha 1 subunit recognized with high affinity by MVIIA corresponds to the N-type channel, the other represents a novel calcium channel distinct from N-, L-, and perhaps P-type channels."

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessively inherited syndrome with predisposition to bone marrow failure and malignancies.

Most genetic subtypes have initially been defined as \"complementation groups\" by cell fusion studies. Here we report a comprehensive genetic subtyping approach for FA that is primarily based on mutation screening, supplemented by protein expression analysis and by functional assays to test for pathogenicity of unclassified variants. Of 80 FA cases analyzed, 73 (91%) were successfully subtyped. In total, 92 distinct mutations were detected, of which 56 were novel (40 in FANCA, eight in FANCC, two in FANCD1, three in FANCE, one in FANCF, and three in FANCG). All known complementation groups were represented, except D2, J, L, and M. Three patients could not be classified because proliferating cell cultures from the probands were lacking. In cell lines from the remaining four patients, immunoblotting was used to determine their capacity to monoubiquitinate FANCD2. In one case FANCD2 monoubiquitination was normal, indicating a defect downstream. In the remaining three cases monoubiquitination was not detectable, indicating a defect upstream. In the latter four patients, pathogenic mutations in a known FA gene may have been missed, or these patients might represent novel genetic subtypes. We conclude that direct mutation screening allows a molecular diagnosis of FA in the vast majority of patients, even in cases where growing cells from affected individuals are unavailable. Proliferating cell lines are required in a minority (<15%) of the patients, to allow testing for FANCD2 ubiquitination status and sequencing of FANCD2 using cDNA, to avoid interference from pseudogenes."

However, this sex difference is also found among the unaffected siblings, and it is not statistically significant. 4. Contrary to assertions made in the literature, there is no clustering of affected in the sequence of siblings, no maternal age effect, and no preference of higher birth orders. 5. A high intrafamilial correlation for age at onset, and (very probably) number and severity of malformations points to genetic heterogeneity. Apart from the standard type, an especially mild type with late onset, few malformations, and a relatively benign course seems to exist. Its counterpart is possibly an especially severe type with early onset, many malformations, and a malignant course.

Most FA proteins form a complex that activates the FANCD2 protein via monoubiquitination, while FANCJ and FANCD1/BRCA2 function downstream of this step. The FA proteins typically lack functional domains, except for FANCJ/BRIP1 and FANCM, which are DNA helicases, and FANCL, which is probably an E3 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. Based on the hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents, the FA proteins are thought to function in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links, which block the progression of DNA replication forks. Here we present a hypothetical model, which not only describes the assembly of the FA pathway, but also positions this pathway in the broader context of DNA cross-link repair. Finally, the possible role for the FA pathway, in particular FANCF and FANCB, in the origin of sporadic cancer is discussed."

We also assessed these functions in mice treated with a known heat shock protein inducer, arimoclomol. Tissue samples of treated and untreated mSOD mice were analysed for AChE and ChAT enzyme activities as markers of neuromuscular function. Sections of hindlimb muscles (TA, EDL and soleus) were also stained for succinate dehydrogenase and silver cholinesterase activities as well as for immunohistochemistry. Hsp70 levels were also measured from muscle samples using ELISA. Results showed that denervation and nerve sprouting were present at symptom onset in fast muscles, although slow muscles remained fully innervated. Cholinergic enzyme activities were reduced prior to denervation and declined further with disease progression. Reduction of endplate size, a slow to fast shift in muscle phenotype was also observed. Treatment with arimoclomol delayed the appearance of these changes, increased innervation, cholinergic enzyme activities and endplate size and reversed muscle fibre transformation. These beneficial effects of arimoclomol in muscles were accompanied by an increase in Hsp70 expression. In conclusion, our results indicate that pharmacological targeting of muscles at early stages of disease may be a successful strategy to ameliorate disease progression in ALS."

Recent years have seen an explosion of research into increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. Arimoclomol (BRX-220), being developed by CytRx Corp, is an oral therapeutic candidate for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of motor neuron disease. ALS is a fatal, incurable disorder, which can present as sporadic (90 to 95% of cases) or familial (5 to 10% of cases) forms. The etiology of sporadic ALS remains unknown and much of the understanding of ALS pathogenesis has been derived through study of its familial forms; in particular, through study of autosomal dominant mutations in the SOD1 (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase) gene, which cause approximately 20% of familial ALS cases. Under conditions of excessive stress, arimoclomol induces amplification of the cytoprotective heat shock response in order to protect motor neurons from death. Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated its effect in the prevention of neuronal loss and promotion of motor neuron survival, even after symptom onset. Clinical trials have reported good tolerability and safety. This paper discusses the rationale for arimoclomol use in ALS, the preclinical and clinical evidence collected to date, the likelihood of its promising preclinical results translating to humans, and the relevance of this research for neurodegeneration as a whole."

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited diseases that cause blindness due to the progressive death of rod and cone photoreceptors in the retina. There are currently no effective treatments for RP. Inherited mutations in rhodopsin, the light-sensing protein of rod photoreceptor cells, are the most common cause of autosomal-dominant RP. The majority of mutations in rhodopsin, including the common P23H substitution, lead to protein misfolding, which is a feature in many neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies have shown that upregulating molecular chaperone expression can delay disease progression in models of neurodegeneration. Here, we have explored the potential of the heat-shock protein co-inducer arimoclomol to ameliorate rhodopsin RP. In a cell model of P23H rod opsin RP, arimoclomol reduced P23H rod opsin aggregation and improved viability of mutant rhodopsin-expressing cells. In P23H rhodopsin transgenic rat models, pharmacological potentiation of the stress response with arimoclomol improved electroretinogram responses and prolonged photoreceptor survival, as assessed by measuring outer nuclear layer thickness in the retina. Furthermore, treated animal retinae showed improved photoreceptor outer segment structure and reduced rhodopsin aggregation compared with vehicle-treated controls. The heat-shock response (HSR) was activated in P23H retinae, and this was enhanced with arimoclomol treatment. Furthermore, the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is induced in P23H transgenic rats, was also enhanced in the retinae of arimoclomol-treated animals, suggesting that arimoclomol can potentiate the UPR as well as the HSR. These data suggest that pharmacological enhancement of cellular stress responses may be a potential treatment for rhodopsin RP and that arimoclomol could benefit diseases where ER stress is a factor."

In this review we summarize the evidence for the neuroprotective effects of enhanced heat shock protein expression by Arimoclomol and other inducers of the Heat Shock Response. ALS is a complex, multifactorial disease affecting a number of cell types and intracellular pathways. Cells and pathways affected by ALS pathology and which may be targeted by a heat shock protein-based therapy are also discussed in this review. For example, protein aggregation is a characteristic pathological feature of neurodegenerative diseases including ALS. Enhanced heat shock protein expression not only affects protein aggregation directly, but can also lead to more effective clearance of protein aggregates via the unfolded protein response, the proteasome-ubiquitin system or by autophagy. However, compounds such as Arimoclomol have effects beyond targeting protein mis-handling and can also affect additional pathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress. Therefore, by targeting multiple pathological mechanisms, compounds such as Arimoclomol may be particularly effective in the development of a disease-modifying therapy for ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motoneuron degeneration, resulting in muscle paralysis and death, typically within 1-5 years of diagnosis. Although the pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear, there is evidence for the involvement of proteasome dysfunction and heat shock proteins in the disease. We have previously shown that treatment with a co-inducer of the heat shock response called arimoclomol is effective in the SOD(G93A) mouse model of ALS, delaying disease progression and extending the lifespan of SOD(G93A) mice (Kieran et al. 2004). However, this previous study only examined the effects arimoclomol when treatment was initiated in pre- or early symptomatic stages of the disease. Clearly, to be of benefit to the majority of ALS patients, any therapy must be effective after symptom onset. In order to establish whether post-symptomatic treatment with arimoclomol is effective, in this study we carried out a systematic assessment of different treatment regimes in SOD(G93A) mice. Treatment with arimoclomol from early (75 days) or late (90 days) symptomatic stages significantly improved muscle function. Treatment from 75 days also significantly increased the lifespan of SOD(G93A) mice, although treatment from 90 days has no significant effect on lifespan. The mechanism of action of arimoclomol involves potentiation of the heat shock response, and treatment with arimoclomol increased Hsp70 expression. Interestingly, this up-regulation in Hsp70 was accompanied by a decrease in the number of ubiquitin-positive aggregates in the spinal cord of treated SOD(G93A) mice, suggesting that arimoclomol directly effects protein aggregation and degradation."

Several single- and multiple-dose safety studies have been completed in healthy control subjects. A 3-month Phase IIa study in people with ALS demonstrated safety at dosages up to 300 mg/day and another study is currently recruiting participants with familial ALS caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase gene. We review the rationale for testing arimoclomol in sporadic and familial ALS in the context of available safety and pharmacokinetic data. Published and unpublished literature relative to the drug in the past two decades is discussed. The current review attempts to bring together our existing understanding of the actions of arimoclomol with the disease profile of ALS. The pharmacological profile of arimoclomol and the available preclinical data make it a promising therapeutic possibility in ALS."

Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, also known as Kennedy's disease, is an adult-onset hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine repeat in the first exon in the androgen receptor gene. Pathologically, the disease is defined by selective loss of spinal and bulbar motor neurons causing bulbar, facial and limb weakness. Although the precise disease pathophysiology is largely unknown, it appears to be related to abnormal accumulation of the pathogenic androgen receptor protein within the nucleus, leading to disruption of cellular processes. Using a mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy that exhibits many of the characteristic features of the human disease, in vivo physiological assessment of muscle function revealed that mice with the pathogenic expansion of the androgen receptor develop a motor deficit characterized by a reduction in muscle force, abnormal muscle contractile characteristics, loss of functional motor units and motor neuron degeneration. We have previously shown that treatment with arimoclomol, a co-inducer of the heat shock stress response, delays disease progression in the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a fatal motor neuron disease. We therefore evaluated the therapeutic potential of arimoclomol in mice with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Arimoclomol was administered orally, in drinking water, from symptom onset and the effects established at 18 months of age, a late stage of disease. Arimoclomol significantly improved hindlimb muscle force and contractile characteristics, rescued motor units and, importantly, improved motor neuron survival and upregulated the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor which possess neurotrophic activity. These results provide evidence that upregulation of the heat shock response by treatment with arimoclomol may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and may also be a possible approach for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases."

METHODS In 560 participants of the Leiden 85-plus Study, we measured NT-proBNP levels and BP at age 85 years, at baseline, and global cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) annually during the follow-up of 5 years. RESULTS Subjects in the highest tertile of NT-proBNP levels scored 1.7 points lower on the MMSE at age 85 years than subjects in the lowest tertile (p = 0.004), and had a 0.24-point-steeper decline in MMSE score per year (p = 0.021). The longitudinal association disappeared after full adjustment for possible confounders (0.14-point-steeper decline, p = 0.187). Subjects in the category \"highest tertile of NT-proBNP and the lowest tertile of systolic BP\" had a 3.7-point-lower MMSE score at baseline (p < 0.001) and a 0.49-point-steeper decline in MMSE score per year (p < 0.001) compared with subjects in the other categories. CONCLUSIONS In the oldest old, high NT-proBNP levels are associated with lower MMSE scores. The combination of high NT-proBNP levels and low systolic BP is associated with worst global cognitive function and the steepest cognitive decline. Possibly, a failing pump function of the heart results in lower BP and lower brain perfusion with resultant brain dysfunction."

METHODS We studied 5,205 men and women (mean age = 75 years) who were recruited into the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk. All participants had pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors thereof. Four domains of cognitive function were tested at baseline and repeated during a follow-up period of 3.2 years. RESULTS Participants with higher NT-proBNP (\u2265450ng/l) had worse baseline cognitive function, including reaction time (mean difference high vs low group = 3.07 seconds, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 5.32), processing speed (-1.02 digits coded, 95% CI = -1.65 to -0.39), and immediate memory (-0.13 pictures remembered, 95% CI = -0.29 to 0.04). There was no significant difference in delayed memory (-0.14, 95% CI = -0.38 to 0.10) between the NT-proBNP groups.

The aim of the present study was to search for changes in plasma levels of 27 vascular-related proteins of healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.

BACKGROUND Clinicopathological studies suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology begins \u223c10-15 years before the resulting cognitive impairment draws medical attention. Biomarkers that can detect AD pathology in its early stages and predict dementia onset would, therefore, be invaluable for patient care and efficient clinical trial design. We utilized a targeted proteomics approach to discover novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers that can augment the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of current leading CSF biomarkers (A\u03b242, tau, p-tau181). METHODS AND FINDINGS Using a multiplexed Luminex platform, 190 analytes were measured in 333 CSF samples from cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0), very mildly demented (CDR 0.5), and mildly demented (CDR 1) individuals. Mean levels of 37 analytes (12 after Bonferroni correction) were found to differ between CDR 0 and CDR>0 groups. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses revealed that small combinations of a subset of these markers (cystatin C, VEGF, TRAIL-R3, PAI-1, PP, NT-proBNP, MMP-10, MIF, GRO-\u03b1, fibrinogen, FAS, eotaxin-3) enhanced the ability of the best-performing established CSF biomarker, the tau/A\u03b242 ratio, to discriminate CDR>0 from CDR 0 individuals. Multiple machine learning algorithms likewise showed that the novel biomarker panels improved the diagnostic performance of the current leading biomarkers. Importantly, most of the markers that best discriminated CDR 0 from CDR>0 individuals in the more targeted ROC analyses were also identified as top predictors in the machine learning models, reconfirming their potential as biomarkers for early-stage AD. Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated that an optimal panel of markers for predicting risk of developing cognitive impairment (CDR 0 to CDR>0 conversion) consisted of calbindin, A\u03b242, and age. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Using a targeted proteomic screen, we identified novel candidate biomarkers that complement the best current CSF biomarkers for distinguishing very mildly/mildly demented from cognitively normal individuals. Additionally, we identified a novel biomarker (calbindin) with significant prognostic potential."

BACKGROUND Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with risk of congestive heart failure (CHF), cognitive dysfunction and depression. CHF itself is linked both to poor cognition and depression. The ventricular N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a marker of CHF, suggesting potential as a marker for cognitive impairment and/or depression. This was tested in the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study (ET2DS). METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Cross-sectional analysis of 1066 men and women aged 60-75 with type 2 diabetes. Results from seven neuropsychological tests were combined in a standardised general cognitive ability factor, 'g'. A vocabulary-based test estimated pre-morbid cognitive ability. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assessed possible depression. After adjustment for age and sex, raised plasma NT-proBNP was weakly associated with lower 'g' and higher depression scores (\u00df -0.09, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.03, p = 0.004 and \u00df 0.08, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12, p<0.001, respectively). Comparing extreme quintiles of NT-proBNP, subjects in the highest quintile were more likely to have reduced cognitive ability (within the lowest tertile of 'g') and 'possible' depression (HADS depression \u22658) (OR 1.80; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.70; p = 0.005 and OR 2.18; 95% CI: 1.28, 3.71; p = 0.004, respectively).

CONCLUSION Raised plasma NT-proBNP was weakly but statistically significantly associated with poorer cognitive function and depression. The prospective phases of the ET2DS will help determine whether or not NT-proBNP can be considered a risk marker for subsequent cognitive impairment and incident depression and whether it provides additional information over and above traditional risk factors for these conditions."

BACKGROUND Natriuretic peptides have prognostic value across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases and may predict cognitive dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular disease, even in the absence of previous stroke.

We assessed the association between N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and cognitive function in community-dwelling ambulatory older adults in the Rancho Bernardo Study. METHODS We studied 950 men and women, aged 60 years and older, who attended a research clinic visit where a medical history and examination were performed, and blood for cardiovascular disease risk factors and NT-proBNP levels were obtained. Three cognitive function tests were administered: the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Trail-Making Test B (Trails B), and Category Fluency. RESULTS Participants with high NT-proBNP levels (\u2265450 pg/mL; n=198) were older and had a higher prevalence of coronary heart disease (12% vs 30%), and stroke (5% vs 11%; P\u2264.001 for both).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Eight hundred thirty-one men and women (aged 60-75 years) attended two waves of the prospective Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study (ET2DS). At baseline, clinical and subclinical macrovascular disease was measured, including cardiovascular event history, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), ankle brachial index (ABI), and serum N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Seven neuropsychological tests were administered at baseline and after 4 years; scores were combined to a standardized general ability factor (g). Adjustment of follow-up g for baseline g assessed 4-year cognitive change. Adjustment for vocabulary (estimated premorbid ability) was used to estimate lifetime cognitive change. RESULTS Measures of cognitive decline were significantly associated with stroke, NT-proBNP, ABI, and cIMT, but not with nonstroke vascular events. The association of stroke with increased estimated lifetime cognitive decline (standardized \u03b2, -0.12) and of subclinical markers with actual 4-year decline (standardized \u03b2, -0.12, 0.12, and -0.15 for NT-proBNP, ABI, and cIMT, respectively) reached the Bonferroni-adjusted level of statistical significance (P < 0.006). Results altered only slightly on adjustment for vascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Stroke and subclinical markers of cardiac stress and generalized atherosclerosis are associated with cognitive decline in older patients with type 2 diabetes.

MEF2C expression initiates cardiomyogenesis, resulting in the up-regulation of Brachyury T, bone morphogenetic protein-4, Nkx2-5, GATA-4, cardiac alpha-actin, and myosin heavy chain expression. Inactivation of the MEF2C gene causes cardiac developmental arrest and severe downregulation of a number of cardiac markers including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). BMP-2, a regulator of cardiac development during embryogenesis, was shown to increase PI 3-kinase activity in cardiac precursor cells, resulting in increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A. Furthermore, expression of MEF-2A increased MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Other studies showed that Gli2 and MEF2C proteins form a complex, capable of synergizing on cardiomyogenesis-related promoters. Dominant interference of calcineurin/mAKAP binding blunts the increase in MEF2 transcriptional activity seen during myoblast differentiation, as well as the expression of endogenous MEF2-target genes.

By using the class II-specific HDAC inhibitor MC1568, we separated class I- and class II-dependent effects and defined the roles of class II enzymes in muscle differentiation in cultured cells and in vivo. MC1568 arrests myogenesis by (i) decreasing myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) expression, (ii) by stabilizing the HDAC4-HDAC3-MEF2D complex, and (iii) paradoxically, by inhibiting differentiation-induced MEF2D acetylation.

The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors is not only important for controlling gene expression in normal cellular programs, like muscle differentiation, T-cell apoptosis, neuronal survival, and synaptic differentiation, but has also been linked to cardiac hypertrophy and other pathological conditions. Lysine acetylation has been shown to modulate MEF2 function, but it is not so clear which deacetylase(s) is involved. We report here that treatment of HEK293 cells with trichostatin A or nicotinamide upregulated MEF2D acetylation, suggesting that different deacetylases catalyze the deacetylation. Related to the trichostatin A sensitivity, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) and HDAC5, two known partners of MEF2, exhibited little deacetylase activity towards MEF2D. In contrast, HDAC3 efficiently deacetylated MEF2D in vitro and in vivo. This was specific, since HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC8 failed to do so. While HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 are known to recognize primarily the MEF2-specific domain, we found that HDAC3 interacts directly with the MADS box. In addition, HDAC3 associated with the acetyltransferases p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) to reverse autoacetylation. Furthermore, the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid acid and thyroid hormone receptor) stimulated the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 towards MEF2 and PCAF. Supporting the physical interaction and deacetylase activity, HDAC3 repressed MEF2-dependent transcription and inhibited myogenesis. These results reveal an unexpected role for HDAC3 and suggest a novel pathway through which MEF2 activity is controlled in vivo."

The Myocyte Enhancer Factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors regulates gene expression during cardiomyocyte differentiation and adaptation of the myocardium to stress. MEF2 activity is enhanced by increasing its transcription and by MAPK-dependent phosphorylation, and is reduced by binding to class-II Histone Deacetylases and by miR-1-mediated degradation of its transcript. Here we show that MEF2 protein abundance is regulated at the translational level, determining myocyte size, during hypertrophy. In order to reduce MEF2 protein expression, its silencing through RNA interference required serum deprivation and, even in this condition, MEF2 protein abundance recovered to basal levels in presence of phenylephrine. Hypertrophic agonist stimulation of neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes increased Mef2 expression by enhancing its translation, without changing its transcription or blocking degradation of the protein. MEF2 abundance was increased by Calcineurin overexpression in vivo and was reduced by Calcineurin inhibition in vitro, without affecting Mef2 mRNA levels. Calcineurin activity influenced expression of Polypyrimidine Tract Protein (PTB), contributing to MEF2 translation. Thus, our results show a previously unrecognized but relevant level of MEF2 activity regulation through the control of its translation that involves Calcineurin and PTB."

The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin is required for the induction of transcriptional events that initiate and promote myogenic differentiation. An important effector for calcineurin in striated muscle is the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). The targeting of the enzyme and substrate to specific intracellular compartments by scaffold proteins often confers specificity in phosphatase activity. We now show that the scaffolding protein mAKAP organizes a calcineurin/MEF2 signaling complex in myocytes, regulating gene transcription. A calcineurin/mAKAP/MEF2 complex can be isolated from C2C12 cells and cardiac myocytes, and the calcineurin/MEF2 association is dependent on mAKAP expression. We have identified a peptide comprising the calcineurin binding domain in mAKAP that can disrupt the binding of the phosphatase to the scaffold in vivo. Dominant interference of calcineurin/mAKAP binding blunts the increase in MEF2 transcriptional activity seen during myoblast differentiation, as well as the expression of endogenous MEF2-target genes. Furthermore, disruption of calcineurin binding to mAKAP in cardiac myocytes inhibits adrenergic-induced cellular hypertrophy. Together these data illustrate the importance of calcineurin anchoring by the mAKAP scaffold for MEF2 regulation."

The growth and differentiation factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) regulates cardiac development during vertebrate embryogenesis. In cardiac precursor cells, BMP-2 has recently been shown to induce expression of cardiac transcription factors, including myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF-2A). The specific signal transduction mechanism by which BMP-2 regulates these actions is not known. We investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in regulating these processes in cardiomyocyte precursor CL6 cells. BMP-2 increased PI 3-kinase activity in these cells in a time-dependent manner, resulting in increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase abolished these actions of BMP-2, indicating the involvement of PI 3-kinase in these processes. Furthermore, BMP-2 stimulated specific protein.DNA complex formation when an MEF-2 DNA recognition element was used as probe. Antibody supershift assay confirmed the presence of MEF-2A in this protein.DNA complex. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity completely prevented the MEF-2A.DNA complex formation. BMP-2 also increased transcription of a reporter gene driven by an MEF-2-specific DNA element in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of MEF-2A increased BMP-2 transcription to the same extent induced by BMP-2, indicating that MEF-2A may participate in BMP-2 autoregulation in CL6 cells. Expression of dominant negative PI 3-kinase completely abolished BMP-2-induced as well as MEF-2A-mediated BMP-2 transcription. Furthermore expression of MEF-2A increased MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Together these data provide the first evidence that BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase signaling regulates MEF-2A expression and define a mechanism of MEF-2A-dependent BMP-2 transcription."

The transcription factors Gli2 (glioma-associated factor 2), which is a transactivator of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signalling, and myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) play important roles in the development of embryonic heart muscle and enhance cardiomyogenesis in stem cells. Although the physiological importance of Shh signalling and MEF2 factors in heart development is well known, the mechanistic understanding of their roles is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Gli2 and MEF2C activated each other's expression while enhancing cardiomyogenesis in differentiating P19 EC cells. Furthermore, dominant-negative mutant proteins of either Gli2 or MEF2C repressed each other's expression, while impairing cardiomyogenesis in P19 EC cells. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed association of Gli2 to the Mef2c gene, and of MEF2C to the Gli2 gene in differentiating P19 cells. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that Gli2 and MEF2C proteins formed a complex, capable of synergizing on cardiomyogenesis-related promoters containing both Gli- and MEF2-binding elements. We propose a model whereby Gli2 and MEF2C bind each other's regulatory elements, activate each other's expression and form a protein complex that synergistically activates transcription, enhancing cardiac muscle development. This model links Shh signalling to MEF2C function during cardiomyogenesis and offers mechanistic insight into their in vivo functions."

The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) proteins are MADS-box transcription factors that are essential for differentiation of all muscle lineages but their mechanisms of action remain largely undefined. In mammals, the earliest site of MEF2 expression is the heart where the MEF2C isoform is detectable as early as embryonic day 7.5. Inactivation of the MEF2C gene causes cardiac developmental arrest and severe downregulation of a number of cardiac markers including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). However, most of these promoters contain no or low affinity MEF2 binding sites and they are not significantly activated by any MEF2 proteins in heterologous cells suggesting a dependence on a cardiac-enriched cofactor for MEF2 action. We provide evidence that MEF2 proteins are recruited to target promoters by the cell-specific GATA transcription factors, and that MEF2 potentiates the transcriptional activity of this family of tissue-restricted zinc finger proteins. Functional MEF2/GATA-4 synergy involves physical interaction between the MEF2 DNA-binding domain and the carboxy zinc finger of GATA-4 and requires the activation domains of both proteins. However, neither MEF2 binding sites nor MEF2 DNA binding capacity are required for transcriptional synergy. The results unravel a novel pathway for transcriptional regulation by MEF2 and provide a molecular paradigm for elucidating the mechanisms of action of MEF2 in muscle and non-muscle cells."

INTRODUCTION Treatment outcomes in unselected patients with advanced NSCLC remain disappointing with platinum-based chemotherapy. The addition of monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR to standard first-line therapy is a validated strategy and has been associated with statistically significant survival advantage in advanced NSCLC. Necitumunab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR, having the potential benefit of lower hypersensitivity reaction risk as compared with cetuximab and also equivalent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. AREAS COVERED This paper reviews literature on preclinical and early clinical development of necitumumab that is available in PubMed and published abstracts from conferences, as well as ongoing trials as specified by clinicaltrials.gov. Recently, the Phase III clinical trial evaluating the addition of necitumumab to pemetrexed and cisplatin in non-squamous NSCLC was prematurely closed due to concerns about the increased risk of thromboembolic events in the experimental arm. Accrual in the Phase III trial of necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in squamous NSCLC is ongoing.

PURPOSE This study aimed to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for disease-directed studies of necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully human IgG(1) monoclonal antibody directed at the epidermal growth factor receptor, and to characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, preliminary antitumor activity, and immunogenicity of necitumumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with 100 to 1,000 mg (flat dosing) necitumumab followed by a 2-week pharmacokinetics sampling period, before beginning 6-week cycles of therapy. RESULTS Sixty patients received necitumumab weekly (29 patients) or every other week (31 patients). Two patients receiving 1,000 mg every 2 weeks experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLT; grade 3 headache), accompanied by grade 3 nausea and vomiting in one patient. Occurring hours after the initial dose, these DLTs established 800 mg as the MTD. Mild dose-related skin toxicity was the most common drug-related toxicity (80%). One patient in each arm experienced grade 3 acneform rash, which responded to oral antibiotics and topical therapy. Toxicity was similar on both schedules. Necitumumab exhibited saturable elimination and nonlinear pharmacokinetics. At 800 mg (both arms), its half-life was approximately 7 days. All patients treated with >or=600 mg necitumumab achieved target trough concentrations (>or=40 microg/mL). Antibodies against necitumumab were not detected. Partial response and stable disease were experienced by 2 and 16 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION Well tolerated, necitumumab is associated with preliminary evidence of antitumor activity, and achieves biologically relevant concentrations throughout the dosing period. The recommended dose of necitumumab for further clinical development is 800 mg (flat dose) weekly or every 2 weeks based on the clinical setting."

BACKGROUND Necitumumab is a second-generation recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 EGFR monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits ligand binding. We aimed to compare necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin with pemetrexed and cisplatin alone in patients with previously untreated, stage IV, non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS We did this randomised, open-label, controlled phase 3 study at 103 sites in 20 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 and adequate organ function, were randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment with a block randomisation scheme (block size of four) via a telephone-based interactive voice-response system or interactive web-response system. Patients received either cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) and pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 3-week cycle for a maximum of six cycles alone, or with necitumumab 800 mg on days 1 and 8. Necitumumab was continued after the end of chemotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Randomisation was stratified by smoking history, ECOG performance status, disease histology, and geographical region. Patients and study investigators were not masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00982111. FINDINGS Between Nov 11, 2009, and Feb 2, 2011, we randomly assigned 633 patients to receive either necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin (n=315) or pemetrexed and cisplatin alone (n=318). Enrolment was stopped on Feb 2, 2011, after a recommendation from the independent data monitoring committee. There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups, with a median overall survival of 11\u00b73 months (95% CI 9\u00b75-13\u00b74) in the necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin group versus 11\u00b75 months (10\u00b71-13\u00b71) in the pemetrexed and cisplatin group (hazard ratio 1\u00b701 [95% CI 0\u00b784-1\u00b721]; p=0\u00b796). The incidence of grade 3 or worse adverse events, including deaths, was higher in the necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin group than in the pemetrexed and cisplatin group; in particular, deaths regarded as related to study drug were reported in 15 (5%) of 304 patients in the necitumumab group versus nine (3%) of 312 patients in the pemetrexed and cisplatin group. Serious adverse events were likewise more frequent in the necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin group than in the pemetrexed and cisplatin group (155 [51%] of 304 vs 127 [41%] of 312 patients). Patients in the necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin group had more grade 3-4 rash (45 [15%] of 304 vs one [<1%] of 312 patients in the pemetrexed and cisplatin alone group), hypomagnesaemia (23 [8%] vs seven [2%] patients), and grade 3 or higher venous thromboembolic events (23 [8%] vs 11 [4%] patients) than did those in the pemetrexed and cisplatin alone group. INTERPRETATION Our findings show no evidence to suggest that the addition of necitumumab to pemetrexed and cisplatin increases survival of previously untreated patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. Unless future studies identify potentially useful predictive biomarkers, necitumumab is unlikely to provide benefit in this patient population when combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin.

In the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group, the number of patients with at least one grade 3 or worse adverse event was higher (388 [72%] of 538 patients) than in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group (333 [62%] of 541), as was the incidence of serious adverse events (257 [48%] of 538 patients vs 203 [38%] of 541). More patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group had grade 3-4 hypomagnesaemia (47 [9%] of 538 patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group vs six [1%] of 541 in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group) and grade 3 rash (20 [4%] vs one [<1%]). Including events related to disease progression, adverse events with an outcome of death were reported for 66 (12%) of 538 patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group and 57 (11%) of 541 patients in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group; these were deemed to be related to study drugs in 15 (3%) and ten (2%) patients, respectively. Overall, we found that the safety profile of necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin was acceptable and in line with expectations. INTERPRETATION Our findings show that the addition of necitumumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy improves overall survival in patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and represents a new first-line treatment option for this disease.

OBJECTIVE This study aims to investigate the potentially protective effect of neuroglobin (Ngb) gene-modified bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in rabbits. METHODS A lentiviral vector containing an Ngb gene was constructed and used to deliver Ngb to BMSCs. Ngb gene-modified BMSCs were then injected at the SCI sites 24 hours after SCI. The motor functions of the rabbits were evaluated by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan rating scale. Fluorescence microscopy, quantitative real-time PCRs, Western blots, malondialdehyde (MDA) tests, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling assays were also performed. RESULTS Ngb expression in the Ngb-BMSC group increased significantly. A more significant functional improvement was observed in the Ngb-BMSC group compared with those in the other groups. Traumatic SCI seemingly led to an increase in MDA level and number of apoptotic cells, which can be prevented by Ngb-BMSC treatment. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that Ngb gene-modified BMSCs can strengthen the therapeutic benefits of BMSCs in reducing secondary damage and improving the neurological outcome after traumatic SCI. Therefore, the combined strategy of BMSC transplantation and Ngb gene therapy can be used to treat traumatic SCI."

Neuroglobin is a neuron-specific hexacoordinated globin capable of binding various ligands, including O2, NO, and CO, the biological function of which is still uncertain. Various studies seem to indicate that neuroglobin is a neuroprotective agent when overexpressed, acting as a potent inhibitor of oxidative and nitrosative stress. In this study, we evaluated the pathophysiological response of the neuroglobin gene and protein expression in the cerebral tissue of rats sustaining traumatic brain injury of differing severity, while simultaneously measuring the oxidant/antioxidant balance. Two levels of trauma (mild and severe) were induced in anesthetized animals using the weight-drop model of diffuse axonal injury. Rats were then sacrificed at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 120 h after traumatic brain injury, and the gene and protein expression of neuroglobin and the concentrations of malondialdehyde (as a parameter representative of reactive oxygen species-mediated damage), nitrite + nitrate (indicative of NO metabolism), ascorbate, and glutathione (GSH) were determined in the brain tissue. Results indicated that mild traumatic brain injury, although causing a reversible increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress (increase in malondialdehyde and nitrite + nitrate) and an imbalance in antioxidants (decrease in ascorbate and GSH), did not induce any change in neuroglobin. Conversely, severe traumatic brain injury caused an over nine- and a fivefold increase in neuroglobin gene and protein expression, respectively, as well as a remarkable increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress and depletion of antioxidants. The results of this study, showing a lack of effect in mild traumatic brain injury as well as asynchronous time course changes in neuroglobin expression, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and antioxidants in severe traumatic brain injury, do not seem to support the role of neuroglobin as an endogenous neuroprotective antioxidant agent, at least under pathophysiological conditions."

Neuroglobin has shown rich neuroprotective effects against cerebral hypoxia, and therefore has the potential to impact outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, to date an association between genetic variation within the human neuroglobin (NGB) gene and recovery post-TBI has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between NGB genotypes and outcomes (as assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS], the Disability Rating Scale [DRS], and the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale-Revised [NRS-R]) after severe TBI. Genotyping using TaqMan allele discrimination for two tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) that represent the two haplotype blocks for NGB (rs3783988 and rs10133981) was completed on DNA obtained from 196 Caucasian patients recovering from severe TBI. Patients were dichotomized based on the presence of the variant allele for each tSNP. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare characteristics between groups. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine NGB tSNPs and recovery from severe TBI. Subjects with the TT genotype (wild-type) for rs3783988 were more likely to have better GOS and DRS scores at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, while rs10133981 genotype was not significantly related to functional outcome. After controlling for age, gender, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, those subjects with the rs3783988 TT genotype had more than a 2.65-times greater likelihood of better functional outcomes than individuals with genotypes harboring a variant allele. Data suggest that the haplotype block represented by rs3783988 in NGB appears to influence recovery after severe TBI.

Currently, we showed that the NGB expression level in neurons increased continuously from 2 h after injury, and reached a peak at 16 h (p<0.01), after which it decreased sharply. NGB that was overexpressed in mechanically injured B104 cells showed significant neuroprotective effects. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity decreased and cell survival rates increased (p<0.01, n=5). In the rat model of focal brain trauma, the NGB expression increased sharply at 1 h, after which it increased continuously until it reached a peak at 6 h, and then gradually decreased (p<0.01, n=5).

There is a significant need for novel treatments that will improve traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes. One potential neuroprotective mechanism is to increase oxygen binding proteins such as neuroglobin. Neuroglobin has a high affinity for oxygen, is an effective free radical scavenger, and is neuroprotective within the brain following hypoxia and ischemia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether neuroglobin overexpression improves sensorimotor outcomes following TBI in transgenic neuroglobin overexpressing (NGB) mice. Additional study aims were to determine if and when an endogenous neuroglobin response occurred following TBI in wild-type (WT) mice, and in what brain regions and cell types the response occurred. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) was performed in adult (5 month) C57/BL6 WT mice, and NGB mice constitutively overexpressing neuroglobin via the chicken beta actin promoter coupled with the cytomegalovirus distal enhancer. The gridwalk task was used for sensorimotor testing of both WT and NGB mice, prior to injury, and at 2, 3, and 7 days post-TBI. NGB mice displayed significant reductions in the average number of foot faults per minute walking at 2, 3, and 7 days post-TBI when compared to WT mice at each time point. Neuroglobin mRNA expression was assessed in the injured cortex of WT mice prior to injury, and at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days post-TBI using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Neuroglobin mRNA was significantly increased at 7 days post-TBI. Immunostaining showed neuroglobin primarily localized to neurons and glial cells in the injured cortex and ipsilateral hippocampus of WT mice, while neuroglobin was present in all brain regions of NGB mice at 7 days post-TBI. These results showed that overexpression of neuroglobin reduced sensorimotor deficits following TBI, and that an endogenous increase in neuroglobin expression occurs during the subacute period. Increasing neuroglobin expression through novel therapeutic interventions during the acute period after TBI may improve recovery."

Inhibitory effects of T(3) on glucose-induced insulin secretion were already seen after 24 h of incubation, indicating that the deleterious effects of T(3) were time-dependent, changing from specific cellular dysfunctions to a severe and extended disturbance of the cellular survival program. Only T(3) concentrations higher than 250 microM were able to decrease cell viability and proliferation rate, to increase the rate of apoptosis and to reduce glucose-induced insulin secretion.

We demonstrated that treatment of primary cultures of rat pancreatic islets with T3 results in augmented \u03b2-cell vitality with an increase of their functional properties. In addition, a sensible reduction of the core cell damage has been observed in the T3 treated islets, suggesting the preservation of the \u03b2-cells integrity during the culture period.

The prominent effect of thyroid hormones was the inhibition of the late phase of glucose-induced insulin secretion.

Thyroxine dehalogenation by rat pancreatic islets was studied incubating isolated islets with labelled T4. [125I]T4 added to the incubation medium was deiodinated by the islets with the consequent production of T3, rT3 and iodide. This deiodination process showed a clear glucose-dependence, being significantly increased in the presence of 16.6 mmol/l glucose. The existence of high and low affinity binding sites for T3 was also demonstrated incubating [125I]T3 with islets under different experimental conditions. The properties of these binding sites were greatly influenced by the extracellular concentration of glucose. Addition of T3 to the incubation medium, significantly modified the insulin release, but its effect varied according to the glucose concentration in the medium, i.e. it enhanced the insulin release at a glucose concentration between 2 to 8 mmol/l; it has no effect at 12 mmol/glucose, and significantly inhibited the secretion of insulin in the presence of 16.6 mmol/l glucose. Our results suggest that thyroid hormones might play a direct regulatory effect on insulin secretion, probably mediated by its deiodination and interaction with specific receptors in the islet cell."

An additive effect was observed when 1000 nM retinoic acid was added to either 50 or 500 nM dexamethasone. Treatment with either of these factors resulted in increased glucokinase mRNA levels. In contrast, treatment with thyroid hormone (T3; 0.2 and 10 nM) had no effect on glucokinase activity, but decreased glucokinase mRNA levels. T3 did not affect the response of either activity or mRNA levels to retinoic acid. Binding experiments revealed the presence of a single class of T3 nuclear receptors, with a Kd of 0.46 x 10(-10) and a binding capacity of 3.84 pmol/mg protein in these cells. This suggests that the changes produced by T3 may be due to a physiological effect mediated via nuclear receptors. Proinsulin mRNA levels were increased by retinoic acid (10-100 nM) and dexamethasone (5-500 nM), but decreased by T3 (0.04-10 nM). Insulin secretion in the absence or presence of glucose and potassium was increased about 50% in cells previously treated with 1000 nM retinoic acid. T3 (0.2 nM) did not affect insulin secretion in the absence or presence of glucose or in the presence of secretagogues (potassium and glyceraldehyde). Dexamethasone (50 nM) did not significantly increase insulin secretion in the absence or presence of glucose or potassium. In contrast, dexamethasone decreased glyceraldehyde-induced insulin secretion by 60% (P less than 0.05).

Here we generated mice specifically lacking p43 to address its physiological influence. We found that p43 is required for normal glucose homeostasis. The p43(-/-) mice had a major defect in insulin secretion both in vivo and in isolated pancreatic islets and a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, a high-fat/high-sucrose diet elicited more severe glucose intolerance than that recorded in normal animals. In addition, we observed in p43(-/-) mice both a decrease in pancreatic islet density and in the activity of complexes of the respiratory chain in isolated pancreatic islets. These dysfunctions were associated with a down-regulation of the expression of the glucose transporter Glut2 and of Kir6.2, a key component of the K(ATP) channel.

Next generation sequencing of exonic amplicons with the 454 genome sequence (GS) FLX System and Conexio Assign ATF 454 software provides high resolution, high throughput HLA genotyping for eight class I and class II loci. HLA typing of potential donors for unrelated bone marrow donor registries typically uses a subset of these loci at high sample throughput and low cost per sample.

During genomic PCR, in this 4-primer system, the outer set of primers containing the MID and the 454 adaptor sequences are incorporated into an amplicon generated by the inner HLA target-specific primers each containing a common sequence tag at the 5' end of the forward and reverse primers.

BACKGROUND Aortopathies are a group of disorders characterized by aneurysms, dilation, and tortuosity of the aorta. Because of the phenotypic overlap and genetic heterogeneity of diseases featuring aortopathy, molecular testing is often required for timely and correct diagnosis of affected individuals. In this setting next generation sequencing (NGS) offers several advantages over traditional molecular techniques. METHODS The purpose of our study was to compare NGS enrichment methods for a clinical assay targeting the nine genes known to be associated with aortopathy. RainDance emulsion PCR and SureSelect RNA-bait hybridization capture enrichment methods were directly compared by enriching DNA from eight samples. Enriched samples were barcoded, pooled, and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. Depth of coverage, consistency of coverage across samples, and the overlap of variants identified were assessed. This data was also compared to whole-exome sequencing data from ten individuals. RESULTS Read depth was greater and less variable among samples that had been enriched using the RNA-bait hybridization capture enrichment method. In addition, samples enriched by hybridization capture had fewer exons with mean coverage less than 10, reducing the need for followup Sanger sequencing. Variants sets produced were 77% concordant, with both techniques yielding similar numbers of discordant variants. CONCLUSIONS When comparing the design flexibility, performance, and cost of the targeted enrichment methods to whole-exome sequencing, the RNA-bait hybridization capture enrichment gene panel offers the better solution for interrogating the aortopathy genes in a clinical laboratory setting."

METHODS Peripheral blood samples were collected from three MFS patients and a normal control with informed consent. Genomic DNA was isolated by standard method and then subjected to targeted sequencing using an Ion Ampliseq(TM) Inherited Disease Panel. Three multiplex PCR reactions were carried out to amplify the coding exons of 328 genes including FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2. DNA fragments from different samples were ligated with barcoded sequencing adaptors. Template preparation and emulsion PCR, and Ion Sphere Particles enrichment were carried out using an Ion One Touch system. The ion sphere particles were sequenced on a 318 chip using the PGM platform. Data from the PGM runs were processed using an Ion Torrent Suite 3.2 software to generate sequence reads. After sequence alignment and extraction of SNPs and indels, all the variants were filtered against dbSNP137. DNA sequences were visualized with an Integrated Genomics Viewer. The most likely disease-causing variants were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS The PGM sequencing has yielded an output of 855.80 Mb, with a > 100 \u00d7 median sequencing depth and a coverage of > 98% for the targeted regions in all the four samples.

Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers. However, the systematic identification of the most informative single modification, or combination thereof, is still lacking. Furthermore, the discovery of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) provides an alternative approach to directly predicting enhancer activity.

We perform a systematic assessment of 24 chromatin modifications in fetal lung fibroblast and demonstrate that a combination of four modifications is sufficient to accurately predict eRNA transcription. Furthermore, we compare the ability of eRNAs and H3K27ac to discriminate enhancer activity. We demonstrate that eRNA is more indicative of enhancer activity. Finally, we apply our fibroblast trained model to six other cell-types and successfully predict eRNA synthesis.

H3K27me1 enrichment varied depending on levels of cell-type specific gene expression, with highest enrichment over transcriptionally active genes. Over individual genes, the highest levels of H3K27me1 enrichment were found over the gene bodies of highly expressed genes.

We reported previously that well-characterized enhancers but not promoters for typical tissue-specific genes, including the classic Alb1 gene, contain unmethylated CpG dinucleotides and evidence of pioneer factor interactions in embryonic stem (ES) cells. These properties, which are distinct from the bivalent histone modification domains that characterize the promoters of genes involved in developmental decisions, raise the possibility that genes expressed only in differentiated cells may need to be marked at the pluripotent stage. Here, we demonstrate that the forkhead family member FoxD3 is essential for the unmethylated mark observed at the Alb1 enhancer in ES cells, with FoxA1 replacing FoxD3 following differentiation into endoderm. Up-regulation of FoxD3 and loss of CpG methylation at the Alb1 enhancer accompanied the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Studies of two genes expressed in specific hematopoietic lineages revealed that the establishment of enhancer marks in ES cells and iPS cells can be regulated both positively and negatively. Furthermore, the absence of a pre-established mark consistently resulted in resistance to transcriptional activation in the repressive chromatin environment that characterizes differentiated cells. These results support the hypothesis that pluripotency and successful reprogramming may be critically dependent on the marking of enhancers for many or all tissue-specific genes."

The identification of transcriptional regulatory modules within mammalian genomes is a prerequisite to understanding the mechanisms controlling regulated gene expression. While high-throughput microarray- and sequencing-based approaches have been used to map the genomic locations of sites of nuclease hypersensitivity or target DNA sequences bound by specific protein factors, the identification of regulatory elements using functional assays, which would provide important complementary data, has been relatively rare. Here we present a method that permits the functional identification of active transcriptional regulatory modules using a simple procedure for the isolation and analysis of DNA derived from nucleosome-free regions (NFRs), the 2% of the cellular genome that contains these elements. The more than 100 new active regulatory DNAs identified in this manner from F9 cells correspond to both promoter-proximal and distal elements, and display several features predicted for endogenous transcriptional regulators, including localization within DNase-accessible chromatin and CpG islands, and proximity to expressed genes. Furthermore, comparison with published ChIP-seq data of ES-cell chromatin shows that the functional elements we identified correspond with genomic regions enriched for H3K4me3, a histone modification associated with active transcriptional regulatory elements, and that the correspondence of H3K4me3 with our promoter-distal elements is largely ES-cell specific. The majority of the distal elements exhibit enhancer activity. Importantly, these functional DNA fragments are an average 149 bp in length, greatly facilitating future applications to identify transcription factor binding sites mediating their activity. Thus, this approach provides a tool for the high-resolution identification of the functional components of active promoters and enhancers."

BACKGROUND Recent genomic scale survey of epigenetic states in the mammalian genomes has shown that promoters and enhancers are correlated with distinct chromatin signatures, providing a pragmatic way for systematic mapping of these regulatory elements in the genome. With rapid accumulation of chromatin modification profiles in the genome of various organisms and cell types, this chromatin based approach promises to uncover many new regulatory elements, but computational methods to effectively extract information from these datasets are still limited. RESULTS We present here a supervised learning method to predict promoters and enhancers based on their unique chromatin modification signatures. We trained Hidden Markov models (HMMs) on the histone modification data for known promoters and enhancers, and then used the trained HMMs to identify promoter or enhancer like sequences in the human genome. Using a simulated annealing (SA) procedure, we searched for the most informative combination and the optimal window size of histone marks. CONCLUSION Compared with the previous methods, the HMM method can capture the complex patterns of histone modifications particularly from the weak signals. Cross validation and scanning the ENCODE regions showed that our method outperforms the previous profile-based method in mapping promoters and enhancers. We also showed that including more histone marks can further boost the performance of our method. This observation suggests that the HMM is robust and is capable of integrating information from multiple histone marks. To further demonstrate the usefulness of our method, we applied it to analyzing genome wide ChIP-Seq data in three mouse cell lines and correctly predicted active and inactive promoters with positive predictive values of more than 80%.

The regulatory elements that direct tissue-specific gene expression in the developing mammalian embryo remain largely unknown. Although chromatin profiling has proven to be a powerful method for mapping regulatory sequences in cultured cells, chromatin states characteristic of active developmental enhancers have not been directly identified in embryonic tissues. Here we use whole-transcriptome analysis coupled with genome-wide profiling of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 to map chromatin states and enhancers in mouse embryonic forelimb and hindlimb. We show that gene-expression differences between forelimb and hindlimb, and between limb and other embryonic cell types, are correlated with tissue-specific H3K27ac signatures at promoters and distal sites. Using H3K27ac profiles, we identified 28,377 putative enhancers, many of which are likely to be limb specific based on strong enrichment near genes highly expressed in the limb and comparisons with tissue-specific EP300 sites and known enhancers. We describe a chromatin state signature associated with active developmental enhancers, defined by high levels of H3K27ac marking, nucleosome displacement, hypersensitivity to sonication, and strong depletion of H3K27me3. We also find that some developmental enhancers exhibit components of this signature, including hypersensitivity, H3K27ac enrichment, and H3K27me3 depletion, at lower levels in tissues in which they are not active. Our results establish histone modification profiling as a tool for developmental enhancer discovery, and suggest that enhancers maintain an open chromatin state in multiple embryonic tissues independent of their activity level."

Histone modifications are now well-established mediators of transcriptional programs that distinguish cell states. However, the kinetics of histone modification and their role in mediating rapid, signal-responsive gene expression changes has been little studied on a genome-wide scale. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), a major regulator of angiogenesis, triggers changes in transcriptional activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to measure genome-wide changes in histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), a marker of active enhancers, in unstimulated HUVECs and HUVECs stimulated with VEGFA for 1, 4, and 12 h. We show that sites with the greatest H3K27ac change upon stimulation were associated tightly with EP300, a histone acetyltransferase. Using the variation of H3K27ac as a novel epigenetic signature, we identified transcriptional regulatory elements that are functionally linked to angiogenesis, participate in rapid VEGFA-stimulated changes in chromatin conformation, and mediate VEGFA-induced transcriptional responses. Dynamic H3K27ac deposition and associated changes in chromatin conformation required EP300 activity instead of altered nucleosome occupancy or changes in DNase I hypersensitivity. EP300 activity was also required for a subset of dynamic H3K27ac sites to loop into proximity of promoters. Our study identified thousands of endothelial, VEGFA-responsive enhancers, demonstrating that an epigenetic signature based on the variation of a chromatin feature is a productive approach to define signal-responsive genomic elements. Further, our study implicates global epigenetic modifications in rapid, signal-responsive transcriptional regulation."

METHODS AND RESULTS Functional characterizations of recombinant human RyR2-G230C channels were performed under conditions mimicking stress. Human RyR2 mutant channels were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells together with calstabin2. RyR2 channels were measured to examine the regulation of the channels by cytosolic versus luminal sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+). A 50-year-old white man with repeated syncopal episodes after exercise had a cardiac arrest and harbored the mutation RyR2-G230C. cAMP-dependent protein kinase-phosphorylated RyR2-G230C channels exhibited a significantly higher open probability at diastolic Ca(2+) concentrations, associated with a depletion of calstabin2. The luminal Ca(2+) sensitivities of RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels were WT-like. CONCLUSIONS The RyR2-G230C mutant exhibits similar biophysical defects compared with previously characterized CPVT mutations: decreased binding of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation under conditions that simulate exercise, consistent with a \"leaky\" channel. Both RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels exhibit normal luminal Ca(2+) activation. Thus, diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak caused by reduced calstabin2 binding and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) is a common mechanism underlying CPVT."

Considering the spread distribution of CPVT mutations, we hypothesized that dysfunctional heterogeneity also was feasible. OBJECTIVE To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which a novel RyR2-V2475F mutation associated with CPVT in humans triggers Ca(2+)-dependent arrhythmias in whole hearts and intact mice. METHODS AND RESULTS Recombinant channels harboring CPVT-linked RyR2 mutations were functionally characterized using tritiated ryanodine binding and single-channel recordings. Homologous recombination was used to generate a knock-in mouse bearing the RyR2-V2475F mutation. Ventricular myocytes from mice heterozygous for the mutation (RyR2-V2475F(+/-)) and their wild-type littermates were Ca(2+)-imaged by confocal microscopy under conditions that mimic stress. The propensity of wild-type and RyR2-V2475F(+/-) mice to have development of arrhythmias was tested at the whole heart level and in intact animals. Recombinant RyR2-V2475F channels displayed increased cytosolic Ca(2+) activation, abnormal protein kinase A phosphorylation, and increased activation by luminal Ca(2+). The RyR2-V2475F mutation appears embryonic-lethal in homozygous mice, but heterozygous mice have no alterations at baseline. Spontaneous Ca(2+) release events were more frequent and had shorter latency in isoproterenol-stimulated cardiomyocytes from RyR2-V2475F(+/-) hearts, but their threshold was unchanged with respect to wild-type. Adrenergically triggered tachyarrhythmias were more frequent in RyR2-V2475F(+/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS The mutation RyR2-V2475F is phenotypically strong among other CPVT mutations and produces heterogeneous mechanisms of RyR2 dysfunction. In living mice, this mutation appears too severe to be harbored in all RyR2 channels but remains undetected under basal conditions if expressed at relatively low levels. \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation breaks the delicate Ca(2+) equilibrium of RyR2-V2475F(+/-) hearts and triggers life-threatening arrhythmias."

CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations result in \"leaky\" RyR2 channels due to the decreased binding of the calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) subunit, which stabilizes the closed state of the channel.

Treatment with a novel RyR2-specific compound (S107) that enhances the binding of calstabin2 to the mutant Ryr2-R2474S channel inhibited the channel leak and prevented cardiac arrhythmias and raised the seizure threshold. Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias.

The ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is the major calcium (Ca2+) release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) required for excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. OBJECTIVE In the present study, we sought to determine whether intracellular diastolic SR Ca2+ leak via RyR2 plays a role in triggering AF and whether inhibiting this leak can prevent AF. METHODS AND RESULTS We generated 3 knock-in mice with mutations introduced into RyR2 that result in leaky channels and cause exercise induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in humans [catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)]. We examined AF susceptibility in these three CPVT mouse models harboring RyR2 mutations to explore the role of diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in AF. AF was stimulated with an intra-esophageal burst pacing protocol in the 3 CPVT mouse models (RyR2-R2474S+/-, 70%; RyR2-N2386I+/-, 60%; RyR2-L433P+/-, 35.71%) but not in wild-type (WT) mice (P<0.05). Consistent with these in vivo results, there was a significant diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in atrial myocytes isolated from the CPVT mouse models. Calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) is an RyR2 subunit that stabilizes the closed state of RyR2 and prevents a Ca2+ leak through the channel. Atrial RyR2 from RyR2-R2474S+/- mice were oxidized, and the RyR2 macromolecular complex was depleted of calstabin2. The Rycal drug S107 stabilizes the closed state of RyR2 by inhibiting the oxidation/phosphorylation induced dissociation of calstabin2 from the channel. S107 reduced the diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in atrial myocytes and decreased burst pacing-induced AF in vivo. S107 did not reduce the increased prevalence of burst pacing-induced AF in calstabin2-deficient mice, confirming that calstabin2 is required for the mechanism of action of the drug. CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrates that RyR2-mediated diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in atrial myocytes is associated with AF in CPVT mice. Moreover, the Rycal S107 inhibited diastolic SR Ca2+ leak through RyR2 and pacing-induced AF associated with CPVT mutations."

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an arrhythmogenic disease that manifests as syncope or sudden death during high adrenergic tone in the absence of structural heart defects. It is primarily caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2). The mechanism by which these mutations cause arrhythmia remains controversial, with discrepant findings related to the role of the RyR2 binding protein FKBP12.6. The purpose of this study was to characterize a novel RyR2 mutation identified in a kindred with clinically diagnosed CPVT. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing were used to screen the RyR2 gene for mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to introduce the mutation into the mouse RyR2 cDNA. The impact of the mutation on the interaction between RyR2 and a 12.6 kDa FK506 binding protein (FKBP12.6) was determined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting and its effect on RyR2 function was characterized by single cell Ca(2+) imaging and [(3)H]ryanodine binding. A novel CPVT mutation, E189D, was identified. The E189D mutation does not alter the affinity of the channel for FKBP12.6, but it increases the propensity for store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). Furthermore, the E189D mutation enhances the basal channel activity of RyR2 and its sensitivity to activation by caffeine. The E189D RyR2 mutation is causative for CPVT and functionally increases the propensity for SOICR without altering the affinity for FKBP12.6. These observations strengthen the notion that enhanced SOICR, but not altered FKBP12.6 binding, is a common mechanism by which RyR2 mutations cause arrhythmias."

CPVT (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) is an inherited life-threatening arrhythmogenic disorder. CPVT is caused by DADs (delayed after-depolarizations) that are induced by spontaneous Ca2+ release during SR (sarcoplasmic reticulum) Ca2+ overload, a process also known as SOICR (store-overload-induced Ca2+ release). A number of mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor RyR2 are linked to CPVT. Many of these CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations enhance the propensity for SOICR and DADs by sensitizing RyR2 to luminal or luminal/cytosolic Ca2+ activation. Recently, a novel CPVT RyR2 mutation, G230C, was found to increase the cytosolic, but not the luminal, Ca2+ sensitivity of single RyR2 channels in lipid bilayers. This observation led to the suggestion of a SOICR-independent disease mechanism for the G230C mutation. However, the cellular impact of this mutation on SOICR is yet to be determined. To this end, we generated stable inducible HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cell lines expressing the RyR2 WT (wild-type) and the G230C mutant. Using single-cell Ca2+ imaging, we found that the G230C mutation markedly enhanced the propensity for SOICR and reduced the SOICR threshold. Furthermore, the G230C mutation increased the sensitivity of single RyR2 channels to both luminal and cytosolic Ca2+ activation and the Ca2+-dependent activation of [3H]ryanodine binding. In addition, the G230C mutation decreased the thermal stability of the N-terminal region (amino acids 1-547) of RyR2. These data suggest that the G230C mutation enhances the propensity for SOICR by sensitizing the channel to luminal and cytosolic Ca2+ activation, and that G230C has an intrinsic structural impact on the N-terminal domains of RyR2."

The CRSP130/Sur2 subunit is common to two distinct types of Mediator complexes, characterized by CRSP70 and CDK8 proteins as transcriptionally active and inactive Mediator, respectively. Knockdown of CRSP130/Sur2 prevents Mediator binding and transactivation through C/EBPbeta. Oncogenic Ras signaling or activating mutations in C/EBPbeta selects the transcriptionally active Mediator complex that also associates with RNA polymerase II.

The CTD-binding complex is structurally and functionally indistinguishable from our previously isolated CRSP coactivator complex. The closely related, but transcriptionally inactive, ARC-L complex failed to interact with the CTD, indicating a significant biochemical difference between CRSP and ARC-L that may, in part, explain their functional divergence. Electron microscopy and three-dimensional single-particle reconstruction reveals a conformation for CTD-CRSP that is structurally distinct from unliganded CRSP or CRSP bound to SREBP-1a, but highly similar to CRSP bound to the VP16 activator.

Interestingly, different activators are known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2 displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates. However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220 for coactivator recruitment, whereas VDR-directed activation by CRSP/Med occurs normally.

These factors work with co-activators to direct transcriptional initiation by the RNA polymerase II apparatus. One class of co-activator, the TAF(II) subunits of transcription factor TFIID, can serve as targets of activators and as proteins that recognize core promoter sequences necessary for transcription initiation. Transcriptional activation by enhancer-binding factors such as Sp1 requires TFIID, but the identity of other necessary cofactors has remained unknown. Here we describe a new human factor, CRSP, that is required together with the TAF(II)s for transcriptional activation by Sp1. Purification of CRSP identifies a complex of approximate relative molecular mass 700,000 (M(r) approximately 700K) that contains nine subunits with M(r) values ranging from 33K to 200K. Cloning of genes encoding CRSP subunits reveals that CRSP33 is a homologue of the yeast mediator subunit Med7, whereas CRSP150 contains a domain conserved in yeast mediator subunit Rgr1. CRSP p200 is identical to the nuclear hormone-receptor co-activator subunit TRIP2/PBP. CRSPs 34, 77 and 130 are new proteins, but the amino terminus of CRSP70 is homologous to elongation factor TFIIS.

The interferon (IFN)-induced signal transduction and transcription activation complex, ISGF3, is assembled from three proteins, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. Of these components, STAT2 provides a fundamental and essential transcriptional activation function for ISGF3. In the present study, we show that ISGF3-mediated transcription is dependent on STAT2 interactions with DRIP150, a subunit of the multimeric Mediator coactivator complex. Other Mediator subunits, DRIP77 and DRIP130, were found either to bind STAT2 without augmenting ISGF3 transcriptional activity or to enhance ISGF3 transcription without binding STAT2, but only DRIP150 both enhanced IFN-dependent transcription and coimmunoprecipitated with STAT2. Endogenous DRIP150 and STAT2 were able to interact in solution, and DNA affinity chromatography and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that DRIP150 binds to the mature, activated ISGF3-DNA complex and is recruited to target gene promoters in an IFN-dependent fashion. IFN-dependent recruitment of DRIP130 to an ISGF3 target promoter and SRB10-STAT2 coprecipitation suggest indirect association with a multisubunit Mediator complex. The site of STAT2 interaction was mapped to DRIP150 residues 188 to 566, which are necessary and sufficient for interaction with STAT2. Expression of this DRIP150 fragment, but not DRIP150 fragments outside the STAT2 interaction region, suppressed ISGF3-mediated transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative fashion, suggesting a direct functional role of this domain in mediating STAT2-DRIP150 interactions. These findings indicate that the IFN-activated ISGF3 transcription factor regulates transcription through contact with DRIP150 and implicate the Mediator coactivator complex in IFN-activated gene regulation."

This polypeptide was specific to metazoans and the \u201csmall\u201d form of the Mediator complex. We report here that a Drosophila melanogaster homologue of MED26 similarly interacts with other components of the core Drosophila Mediator complex but not with the kinase module and is recruited to genes upon activation. Using a null allele of Med26, we show that Med26 is required for organismal viability but not for cell proliferation or survival. Clones lacking Med26 in the wing disc lead to loss of the adult wing margin and reduced expression of genes involved in wing margin formation. Surprisingly, when polytene chromosomes from the salivary gland were examined using antibodies to Med26, it was apparent that a fraction of the protein was associated with the chromocenter, which contains pericentric heterochromatin. This staining colocalizes with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Immunoprecipitation experiments show that Med26 interacts with HP1. The interaction is mediated through the chromoshadow domain of HP1 and through the conserved motif in the carboxy terminus of the Med26 protein.

As a first step toward structurally dissecting activator/TFIID interactions, we determined the three-dimensional structures of TFIID bound to three distinct activators (i.e., the tumor suppressor p53 protein, glutamine-rich Sp1 and the oncoprotein c-Jun) and compared their structures as determined by electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction. By a combination of EM and biochemical mapping analysis, our results uncover distinct contact regions within TFIID bound by each activator.

In this paper, we describe an analysis of indel regions that accommodate length variations amongst related proteins. We have developed an algorithm CUSP, to examine multi-membered PASS2 superfamily alignments to identify indel regions in an automated manner. Further, we have used the method to characterize the length, structural type and biochemical features of indels in related protein domains. RESULTS CUSP, examines protein domain structural alignments to distinguish regions of conserved structure common to related proteins from structurally unconserved regions that vary in length and type of structure. On a non-redundant dataset of 353 domain superfamily alignments from PASS2, we find that 'length- deviant' protein superfamilies show > 30% length variation from their average domain length. 60% of additional lengths that occur in indels are short-length structures (< 5 residues) while 6% of indels are > 15 residues in length. Structural types in indels also show class-specific trends. CONCLUSION The extent of length variation varies across different superfamilies and indels show class-specific trends for preferred lengths and structural types. Such indels of different lengths even within a single protein domain superfamily could have structural and functional consequences that drive their selection, underlying their importance in similarity detection and computational modelling.

BACKGROUND Antibodies are prototypes of multimeric proteins and consist of structurally similar domains. The two variable domains of an antibody (VH and VL) interact through a large hydrophobic interface and can be expressed as covalently linked single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments. The in vitro folding of scFv fragments after long-term denaturation in guanidinium chloride is known to be slow. In order to delineate the nature of the rate-limiting step, the folding of the scFv fragment of an antibody after short-term denaturation has been investigated. RESULTS Secondary structure formation, measured by H/D-exchange protection, of a mutant scFv fragment of an antibody after short incubation in 6 M guanidinium chloride was shown to be multiphasic. NMR analysis shows that an intermediate with significant proton protection is observed within the dead time of the manual mixing experiments. Subsequently, the folding reaction proceeds via a biphasic reaction and mass spectrometry analyses of the exchange experiments confirm the existence of two parallel pathways. In the presence of cyclophilin, however, the faster of the two phases vanishes (when followed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence), while the slower phase is not significantly enhanced by equimolar cyclophilin. CONCLUSIONS The formation of an early intermediate, which shows amide-proton exchange protection, is independent of proline isomerization. Subsequently, a proline cis-trans isomerization reaction in the rapidly formed intermediate, producing 'non-native' isomers, competes with the fast formation of native species. Interface formation in a folding intermediate of the scFv fragment is proposed to prevent the back-isomerization of these prolines from being efficiently catalyzed by cyclophilin."

The five remaining Fab mutants showed antigen-binding properties similar to those of wild-type Fab. Recombinant Fab mutants that showed decreased CD4 binding also lost their capacity to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus promoter activation and the antigen-presenting ability that wild-type Fab displays.

In non-camelised, VL-associated VH domains the side-chains of Val37 and Trp103 are in contact with the VL while the Arg38 side-chain is buried within the VH. Reorientation of Trp103 is due to the local structure in the beta-bulge of strand G. Reorientation of Val37 and Arg38 is caused by a disruption of regular beta-structure in strand C opposite the beta-bulge in strand C'. These changes, combined with the more hydrophilic side-chains of the camelised residues, reduce hydrophobicity and prevent non-specific binding of camelised VH domains, which proved critical for their use as small recognition units. The VH-P8 structure also indicates structural reasons for two other mutations specific for light-chain-lacking camel immunoglobins. Absence of the VH-typical Arg94/Asp101 salt bridge at the base of the H3 loop in VH-P8 may explain why a positively charged residue at position 94 is not conserved in camels. Reorientation of Val37 suggests a function of the camel-specific phenylalanine residue at this position in the hydrophobic core of light-chain-lacking camel heavy chains."

Antibody heavy chain variable domains (VH) lacking their light chain (VL) partner are prime candidates for the design of minimum-size immunoreagents. To obtain structural information about isolated VH domains, a human VH was labelled with 15N or doubly labelled with both 15N and 13C and was studied by heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Most (90%) of the 1H and 15N main-chain signals were assigned through two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY experiments on the unlabelled VH and three-dimensional heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation TOCSY and NOESY experiments on the 15N-labelled VH. Four short stretches of the polypeptide chain could only be assigned on the basis of three-dimensional HNCA and HN(CO)CA experiments on the 13C-/15N-labelled protein. Long-range interstrand backbone NOEs suggest the presence of two adjacent beta-sheets formed by altogether nine antiparallel beta-strands. 3JNHC alpha H coupling constants and the location of slowly exchanging backbone amides support this interpretation. The secondary structure of the isolated VH is identical to that of heavy chain variable domains in intact antibodies, where VH domains are packed against a VL domain. The backbone assignments of the VH made it possible to locate its Protein A binding site. Chemical shift movements after complexing with the IgG binding fragment of Protein A indicate binding through one of the two beta-sheets of the VH.

Light chain, or AL, amyloidosis is a pathological condition arising from systemic extracellular deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain variable domains in the form of insoluble amyloid fibrils, especially in the kidneys. Substantial evidence suggests that amyloid fibril formation from native proteins occurs via a conformational change leading to a partially folded intermediate conformation, whose subsequent association is a key step in fibrillation. In the present investigation, we have examined the properties of a recombinant amyloidogenic light chain variable domain, SMA, to determine whether partially folded intermediates can be detected and correlated with aggregation. The results from spectroscopic and hydrodynamic measurements, including far- and near-UV circular dichroism, FTIR, NMR, and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and small-angle X-ray scattering, reveal the build-up of two partially folded intermediate conformational states as the pH is decreased (low pH destabilized the protein and accelerated the kinetics of aggregation). A relatively nativelike intermediate, I(N), was observed between pH 4 and 6, with little loss of secondary structure, but with significant tertiary structure changes and enhanced ANS binding, indicating exposed hydrophobic surfaces. At pH below 3, we observed a relatively unfolded, but compact, intermediate, I(U), which was characterized by decreased tertiary and secondary structure. The I(U) intermediate readily forms amyloid fibrils, whereas I(N) preferentially leads to amorphous aggregates. Except at pH 2, where negligible amorphous aggregate is formed, the amorphous aggregates formed significantly more rapidly than the fibrils. This is the first indication that different partially folded intermediates may be responsible for different aggregation pathways (amorphous and fibrillar). The data support the hypothesis that amyloid fibril formation involves the ordered self-assembly of partially folded species that are critical soluble precursors of fibrils."

In addition to being regulated by modifications of DNA and histones, Pol III genes and its transcription factors have been implicated in the organization of nuclear chromatin in several organisms.

To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver. We observe a positive correlation between the number of distinct TFs bound and the presence of CNC sites. In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes. We also show that cohesin presence partially explains the commonly observed discrepancy between TF motif score and ChIP signal. Evidence from these statistical analyses in wild-type cells, and comparisons to maps of TF binding in Rad21-cohesin haploinsufficient mouse liver, suggests that cohesin helps to stabilize large protein-DNA complexes.

By performing matched genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-seq) in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), we discovered thousands of genomic sites that share cohesin and estrogen receptor alpha (ER) yet lack CTCF binding. By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, estrogen-regulated genes are preferentially bound by both ER and cohesin, and functionally, the silencing of cohesin caused aberrant re-entry of breast cancer cells into cell cycle after hormone treatment. We combined chromosomal interaction data in MCF-7 cells with our cohesin binding data to show that cohesin is highly enriched at ER-bound regions that capture inter-chromosomal loop anchors.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency is characterized by the highly regulated transcription of a few viral genes essential for genome maintenance and host cell survival. A major latency control region has been identified upstream of the divergent promoters for the multicistronic transcripts encoding LANA (ORF73), vCyclin (ORF72), and vFLIP (ORF71) and for the complementary strand transcript encoding K14 and vGPCR (ORF74). Previous studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex. Deletion of the CTCF-cohesin binding site caused an inhibition of cell growth and viral genome instability. We now show that the KSHV genes regulated by CTCF-cohesin are under cell cycle control and that mutation of the CTCF binding sites abolished cell cycle-regulated transcription. Cohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Subcellular distribution of CTCF and colocalization with cohesins also varied across the cell cycle. Ectopic expression of Rad21 repressed CTCF-regulated transcription of KSHV lytic genes, and a Rad21-CTCF chimeric protein converted CTCF into an efficient transcriptional repressor of KSHV genes normally activated in the G(2) phase. We conclude that cohesins interact with CTCF in mid-S phase and repress CTCF-regulated genes in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival."

Because CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) has been demonstrated to be involved in long-range chromosomal interactions, we hypothesized that CTCF may promote the contraction of the Igh locus. ChIP sequencing was performed on pro-B cells, revealing colocalization of CTCF and Rad21 binding at ~60 sites throughout the V(H) region and 2 other sites within the Igh locus. These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangement. To test whether CTCF was involved in locus compaction, we used 3D-FISH to measure compaction in pro-B cells transduced with CTCF shRNA retroviruses. Reduction of CTCF binding resulted in a decrease in Igh locus compaction. Long-range interactions within the Igh locus were measured with the chromosomal conformation capture assay, revealing direct interactions between CTCF sites 5' of DFL16 and the 3' regulatory region, and also the intronic enhancer (E\u03bc), creating a D(H)-J(H)-E\u03bc-C(H) domain.

Subsequent structure-activity data for the synthetic 2-arylbenzothiophenes evaluated in this study indicate that optimal antileishmanial potency is dependent on the presence of two basic side chains. In addition, the primary structural features required for estrogen receptor binding, the phenols, are not required for inhibiting parasitic growth. Significantly, the most active antileishmanial benzothiophenes lack the pharmacophore for estrogen receptor activity and therefore address potential concerns about the undesirable effects of using selective estrogen receptor modulators in women and children with leishmaniasis. Three compounds selected from the screening have shown consistent activity against all species and stages of Leishmania in vitro although improvements in selectivity are needed. These compounds represent viable starting points for further optimization as antileishmanial agents."

To identify new chemical entities as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) targeting hCA VII, we used a structure-based approach. By means of LigandScout software we built pharmacophore models from crystal structures of two well-known CAIs in complex with hCA VII. A merged pharmacophore hypothesis has been obtained. Subsequently, a focused library of compounds was screened against pharmacophore model and the most interesting hits were docked into the crystal structure of hCA VII.

This chapter is a review of the most recent developments in the field of pharmacophore modeling, covering both methodology and application. Pharmacophore-based virtual screening is nowadays a mature technology, very well accepted in the medicinal chemistry laboratory. Nevertheless, like any empirical approach, it has specific limitations and efforts to improve the methodology are still ongoing. Fundamentally, the core idea of \"stripping\" functional groups of their actual chemical nature in order to classify them into very few pharmacophore types, according to their dominant physico-chemical features, is both the main advantage and the main drawback of pharmacophore modeling. The advantage is the one of simplicity - the complex nature of noncovalent ligand binding interactions is rendered intuitive and comprehensible by the human mind. Although computers are much better suited for comparisons of pharmacophore patterns, a chemist's intuition is primarily scaffold-oriented. Its underlying simplifications render pharmacophore modeling unable to provide perfect predictions of ligand binding propensities - not even if all its subsisting technical problems would be solved. Each step in pharmacophore modeling and exploitation has specific drawbacks: from insufficient or inaccurate conformational sampling to ambiguities in pharmacophore typing (mainly due to uncertainty regarding the tautomeric/protonation status of compounds), to computer time limitations in complex molecular overlay calculations, and to the choice of inappropriate anchoring points in active sites when ligand cocrystals structures are not available. Yet, imperfections notwithstanding, the approach is accurate enough in order to be practically useful and actually is the most used virtual screening technique in medicinal chemistry - notably for \"scaffold hopping\" approaches, allowing the discovery of new chemical classes carriers of a desired biological activity."

It has become apparent of late that even in tamoxifen and/or aromatase resistant breast cancers, ER\u03b1 remains a bona fide therapeutic target. Not surprisingly, therefore, there has been considerable interest in developing Selective ER Degraders (SERDs), compounds that target the receptor for degradation. Currently, ICI 182,780 (ICI, fulvestrant) is the only SERD approved for the treatment of breast cancer. However, the poor pharmaceutical properties of this injectable drug and its lack of superiority over second line aromatase inhibitors in late stage breast cancer have negatively impacted its clinical use. These findings have provided the impetus to develop second generation, orally bioavailable SERDs with which quantitative turnover of ER\u03b1 in tumors can be achieved. Interestingly however, the contribution of SERD activity to fulvestrant efficacy is unclear, making it difficult to define the characteristics desired of the next generation of ER antagonists. It is of significance therefore, that we have determined that the antagonist activity of ICI and its ability to induce ER\u03b1 degradation are not coupled processes. Specifically, our results indicate that it is the ability of ICI to interact with ER\u03b1 and to (a) competitively displace estradiol and (b) induce a conformational change in ER incompatible with transcriptional activation that are likely to be the most important pharmacological characteristics of this drug. Collectively, these data argue for a renewed emphasis on the development of high affinity, orally bioavailable pure antagonists and suggest that SERD activity though proven effective may not be required for ER\u03b1 antagonism in breast cancer."

PURPOSE Estrogen receptor (ER) targeting is key in management of receptor-positive breast cancer. Currently, there are no methods to optimize anti-ER therapy dosing. This study assesses the use of 16\u03b1-(18)F-fluoroestradiol ((18)F-FES) PET for fulvestrant dose optimization in a preclinical ER(+) breast cancer model. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In vitro, (18)F-FES retention was compared with ER\u03b1 protein expression (ELISA) and ESR1 mRNA transcription (qPCR) in MCF7 cells (ER(+)) after treatment with different fulvestrant doses. MCF7 xenografts were grown in ovariectomized nude mice and assigned to vehicle, low- (0.05 mg), medium- (0.5 mg), or high-dose (5 mg) fulvestrant treatment groups (5-7 per group). Two and 3 days after fulvestrant treatment, PET/CT was performed using (18)F-FES and (18)F-FDG, respectively. ER expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and qPCR on xenografts. Tumor proliferation was assessed using Ki67 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS In vitro, we observed a parallel graded reduction in (18)F-FES uptake and ER expression with increased fulvestrant doses, despite enhancement of ER mRNA transcription. In xenografts, ER expression significantly decreased with increased fulvestrant dose, despite similar mRNA expression and Ki67 staining among the treatment groups. We observed a significant dose-dependent reduction of (18)F-FES PET mean standardized uptake value (SUV(mean)) with fulvestrant treatment but no significant difference among the treatment groups in (18)F-FDG PET SUV(mean). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that (18)F-FES uptake mirrors the dose-dependent changes in functional ER expression with fulvestrant resulting in ER degradation and/or blockade; these precede changes in tumor metabolism and proliferation. Quantitative (18)F-FES PET may be useful for tracking early efficacy of ER blockade/degradation and guiding ER-targeted therapy dosing in patients with breast cancer."

The 8p11-p12 amplicon occurs in approximately 15% of breast cancers in aggressive luminal B-type tumors. Previously, we identified WHSC1L1 as a driving oncogene from this region. Here, we demonstrate that over-expression of WHSC1L1 is linked to over-expression of ER\u03b1 in SUM-44 breast cancer cells and in primary human breast cancers. Knock-down of WHSC1L1, particularly WHSC1L1-short, had a dramatic effect on ESR1 mRNA and ER\u03b1 protein levels. SUM-44 cells do not require exogenous estrogen for growth in vitro; however, they are dependent on ER\u03b1 expression, as ESR1 knock-down or exposure to the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant resulted in growth inhibition. ChIP-Seq experiments utilizing ER\u03b1 antibodies demonstrated extensive ER\u03b1 binding to chromatin in SUM-44 cells under estrogen-free conditions. ER\u03b1 bound to ERE and FOXA1 motifs under estrogen-free conditions and regulated expression of estrogen-responsive genes. Short-term treatment with estradiol enhanced binding of ER\u03b1 to chromatin and influenced expression of many of the same genes to which ER\u03b1 was bound under estrogen-free conditions. Finally, knock-down of WHSC1L1 in SUM-44 cells resulted in loss of ER\u03b1 binding to chromatin under estrogen-free conditions, which was restored upon exposure to estradiol. These results indicate the SUM-44 cells are a good model of a subset of luminal B breast cancers that have the 8p11-p12 amplicon, over-express WHSC1L1, and over-express ER\u03b1, but are independent of estrogen for binding to chromatin and regulation of gene expression. Breast cancers such as these, that are dependent on ER\u03b1 activity but independent of estradiol, are a major cause of breast cancer mortality."

Approximately 80% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor alpha (ER-\u03b1) positive, and although women typically initially respond well to antihormonal therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, resistance often emerges. Although a variety of resistance mechanism may be at play in this state, there is evidence that in many cases the ER still plays a central role, including mutations in the ER leading to constitutively active receptor. Fulvestrant is a steroid-based, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that both antagonizes and degrades ER-\u03b1 and is active in patients who have progressed on antihormonal agents. However, fulvestrant suffers from poor pharmaceutical properties and must be administered by intramuscular injections that limit the total amount of drug that can be administered and hence lead to the potential for incomplete receptor blockade.

Effects on growth were examined in response to hormonal and targeted agents, and mutation-specific changes were studied using microarray and Western blot analysis. We determined that the HBD-ESR1 mutations alter anti-proliferative effects to tamoxifen (Tam), due to cell-intrinsic changes in activation of the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway and levels of PIK3R1/PIK3R3. The selective estrogen receptor degrader, fulvestrant, significantly reduced the anchorage-independent growth of ESR1 mutant-expressing cells, while combination treatments with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, or an inhibitor blocking IGF1R, and the insulin receptor significantly enhanced anti-proliferative responses. Using digital drop (dd) PCR, we identified mutations at high frequencies ranging from 12 % for Y537N, 5 % for Y537S, and 2 % for D538G in archived primary breast tumors from women treated with adjuvant mono-tamoxifen therapy. The HBD-ESR1 mutations were not associated with recurrence-free or overall survival in response in this patient cohort and suggest that knowledge of other cell-intrinsic factors in combination with ESR1 mutation status will be needed determine anti-proliferative responses to Tam."

Traditional menopausal hormone therapy containing estrogens/progestin has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, and estrogen exposure is known to promote growth and proliferation of a majority of breast cancers. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to consider the breast safety profile of any hormone-based therapy used in postmenopausal women. This review provides an overview of the breast safety and tolerability profiles of currently marketed selective estrogen receptor modulators, antiestrogens, and the first tissue selective estrogen complex combining conjugated estrogens with the selective estrogen receptor modulator bazedoxifene in postmenopausal women. Selective estrogen receptor modulators and antiestrogens act as estrogen receptor antagonists in the breast. Tamoxifen, toremifene, and the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant are used to treat breast cancer, and tamoxifen and raloxifene protect against breast cancer in high-risk women. Postmenopausal women using selective estrogen receptor modulators for prevention or treatment of osteoporosis (raloxifene, bazedoxifene) can be reassured that these hormonal treatments do not adversely affect their risk of breast cancer and may, in the case of raloxifene, even be protective. There are limited data on breast cancer in women who use ospemifene for dyspareunia. Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene use for up to two years did not increase mammographic breast density or breast pain/tenderness, and there was no evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer, suggesting that conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene has an improved breast safety profile compared with traditional menopausal hormone therapies. Future research will continue to focus on development of selective estrogen receptor modulators and selective estrogen receptor modulator combinations capable of achieving the ideal balance of estrogen receptor agonist and antagonist effects."

However, tumor resistance limits the duration of response. The clinical efficacy of fulvestrant, a selective ER degrader (SERD) that triggers receptor degradation, has confirmed that ESR1 often remains engaged in endocrine therapy resistant cancers. Recently developed, selective ER modulators (SERMs)/SERD hybrids (SSHs) that facilitate ESR1 degradation in breast cancer cells and reproductive tissues have been advanced as an alternative treatment for advanced breast cancer, particularly in the metastatic setting. RAD1901 is one SSH currently being evaluated clinically that is unique among ESR1 modulators in that it readily enters the brain, a common site of breast cancer metastasis. In this study, RAD1901 inhibited estrogen activation of ESR1 in vitro and in vivo, inhibited estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth, and mediated dose-dependent downregulation of ESR1 protein. However, doses of RAD1901 insufficient to induce ESR1 degradation were shown to result in the activation of ESR1 target genes and in the stimulation of xenograft tumor growth. RAD1901 is an SSH that exhibits complex pharmacology in breast cancer models, having dose-dependent agonist/antagonist activity displayed in a tissue-selective manner. It remains unclear how this unique pharmacology will impact the utility of RAD1901 for breast cancer treatment.

However, although initial treatment with these agents is often successful, many women eventually relapse with drug-resistant breast cancers.

Here we describe and characterize a novel, orally bioavailable small-molecule selective estrogen receptor degrader, RAD1901, and evaluate its therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer. RAD1901 selectively binds to and degrades the ER and is a potent antagonist of ER-positive breast cancer cell proliferation. Importantly, RAD1901 produced a robust and profound inhibition of tumor growth in MCF-7 xenograft models. In an intracranial MCF-7 model, RAD1901-treated animals survived longer than those treated with either control or fulvestrant, suggesting the potential benefit of RAD1901 in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain. Finally, RAD1901 preserved ovariectomy-induced bone loss and prevented the uterotropic effects of E2, suggesting that it may act selectively as an agonist in bone but as an antagonist in breast and uterine tissues.

Dopa decarboxylase inhibitors are routinely used to potentiate the effects of L-DOPA in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, neither in clinical use nor in experimental models of Parkinson's disease have the timing and dose of dopa decarboxylase inhibitors been thoroughly explored. We now report on the choice of dopa decarboxylase inhibitors, dose and the time of dosing relationships of carbidopa, benserazide and L-alpha-methyl dopa (L-AMD) in potentiating the effects of L-DOPA in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmoset. Pre-treatment with benserazide for up to 3h did not alter the motor response to L-DOPA compared to simultaneous administration with L-DOPA. There was some evidence of a relationship between carbidopa and benserazide dose and increased locomotor activity and the reversal of motor disability. But in general, commonly used dose levels of dopa decarboxylase inhibitors appeared to produce a maximal motor response to L-DOPA. In contrast, dyskinesia intensity and duration continued to increase with both carbidopa and benserazide dose. The novel dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, L-AMD, increased locomotor activity and improved motor disability to the same extent as carbidopa or benserazide but importantly this was accompanied by significantly less dyskinesia. This study shows that currently, dopa decarboxylase inhibitors may be routinely employed in the MPTP-treated primate at doses which are higher than those necessary to produce a maximal potentiation of the anti-parkinsonian effect of L-DOPA. This may lead to excessive expression of dyskinesia in this model of Parkinson's disease and attention should be given to the dose regimens currently employed."

Ten patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and severe motor-fluctuations participated in an open inpatient trial comparing the efficacy of standard L-Dopa/benserazide (Madopar) treatment with that of an oral sustained-release preparation (Madopar HBS) combined with the standard drug. Clinical assessments of the patients' parkinsonian disabilities were performed daily by one of the investigators and subjects kept self-scoring \"on-off\" diaries throughout the trial. Plasma concentrations of L-Dopa were followed during both types of therapy in five cases using standard high performance liquid chromatography technique. Sustained-release L-Dopa treatment led to a reduction in end-of-dose deterioration and on-off swings in six patients and doses needed averaged 1.6-fold of previous standard L-Dopa. Drug-induced dyskinesias decreased in one case with sustained-release therapy, remained unchanged in three, and increased in six cases when compared with conventional L-Dopa. Plasma levels of L-Dopa were more stable with the sustained-release preparation in four of five patients. During subsequent outpatient follow-ups of up to 4 months, three of the six responders in this study continued to obtain benefit from the trial drug. It is concluded that oral sustained-release L-Dopa treatment can reduce response-fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease."

Benserazide is commonly used for Parkinson's disease in combination with L-DOPA as a peripheral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor. However, recent studies using intact animals indicate that benserazide acts also in the central nervous system. We determined the influence of benserazide on the central AADC activity in rats with dopaminergic denervation and observed changes in extracellular dopamine (DA) levels after benserazide and L-DOPA administration. First, using in vivo microdialysis technique, we measured extracellular DA levels in the striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats treated with benserazide and L-DOPA. Second, we measured AADC activity in the striatal tissues after benserazide administration. Although administration of 5, 10 and 50 mg/kg benserazide to 6-OHDA-lesioned rats showed an identical increase in exogenous L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA levels, the time to reach the peak DA levels were significantly prolonged by benserazide dose-dependently. The AADC activity in the denervated striatal tissues showed a significant decrease by 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg benserazide. These results suggest that benserazide reduces the central AADC activity in the striatum of rats with nigrostriatal denervation, which leads to changes in the metabolism of exogenous L-DOPA. Central activity of AADC inhibitors should be taken into consideration when they are used both in experimental and clinical studies on Parkinson's disease."

We have evaluated, in this study, the effect of (-)-OSU6162, on L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesias in a primate model of Parkinson's disease. Five 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated cynomolgus monkeys with a stable parkinsonian syndrome and reproducible dyskinesias to L-DOPA were used in this study. The monkeys were housed in observation cages equipped with an electronic motility monitoring system. They were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with L-DOPA methyl ester (125 mg per animal) plus benserazide (50 mg per animal; L-DOPA/benserazide) alone or in combination with (-)-OSU6162 (1.0, 3.0, 6.0 or 10 mg/kg, s.c.). Subcutaneous injection of sterile saline was used as control. L-DOPA/benserazide increased locomotion and improved parkinsonism but also induced dyskinesias. Co-administration of (-)-OSU6162 with L-DOPA/benserazide produced a significant reduction in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. This improvement in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias occurred mainly at the onset of the L-DOPA/benserazide effect as reflected by an increase in the duration of the \"ON\" state without dyskinesias up to 3.4 fold after (-)-OSU6162 co-administration as compared to L-DOPA/benserazide alone. The anti-dyskinetic effect of (-)-OSU6162 was maintained during 14 days and no tolerance to this effect was observed. Our data suggests that (-)-OSU6162 could be of significant clinical value to reduce L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in fluctuating advanced Parkinson's disease patients."

Substitution of L-DOPA standard by L-DOPA slow release took on average 2-4 weeks. Patients were subsequently treated for 6 months. Due to a lower bioavailability of the slow release formulation--the latter is based on the \"hydrodynamically balanced system\" (HBS)--, the patients remained initially on their time schedule of drug intake but received a higher dose of L-DOPA slow release compared to the preceding L-DOPA standard therapy. In 20 centers 37 men and 26 women were included into the study. 27 males and 20 females completed the 6 month treatment period. Before switching, the patients received 438 +/- 213 mg a day L-DOPA standard, after conversion, the average dose was 617 +/- 323 mg L-DOPA slow release and 107 +/- 95 mg L-DOPA standard a day. Fluctuations during the day and at night which were rated according to a newly developed clinical 5-point rating scale were significantly improved by the treatment regimen from 2.8 +/- 0.9 to 1.4 +/- 1.2.

METHODS Male rats received a single oral dose of 80 mg/kg L-dopa or 20 mg/kg benserazide or 80/20 mg/kg L-dopa/benserazide. Based on plasma concentrations the kinetics of L-dopa, 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD), benserazide, and its metabolite Ro 04-5127 were characterized by noncompartmental analysis and a compartmental model where total L-dopa clearance was the sum of the clearances mediated by amino-acid-decarboxylase (AADC), catechol-O-methyltransferase and other enzymes. In the model Ro 04-5127 inhibited competitively the L-dopa clearance by AADC. RESULTS The coadministration of L-dopa/benserazide resulted in a major increase in systemic exposure to L-dopa and 3-OMD and a decrease in L-dopa clearance. The compartmental model allowed an adequate description of the observed L-dopa and 3-OMD concentrations in the absence and presence of benserazide. It had an advantage over noncompartmental analysis because it could describe the temporal change of inhibition and recovery of AADC. CONCLUSIONS Our study is the first investigation where the kinetics of benserazide and Ro 04-5127 have been described by a compartmental model. The L-dopa/benserazide model allowed a mechanism-based view of the L-dopa/benserazide interaction and supports the hypothesis that Ro 04-5127 is the primary active metabolite of benserazide."

L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) is the gold standard for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), but long-term therapy is associated with the emergence of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). In the present study, L-dopa and benserazide were loaded by poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres (LBM), which can release levodopa and benserazide in a sustained manner in order to continuous stimulate dopaminergic receptors. We investigated the role of striatal DR1/PKA/P-tau signal transduction in the molecular event underlying LID in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of PD. We found that animals rendered dyskinetic by L-dopa treatment, administration of LBM prevented the severity of AIM score, as well as improvement in motor function. Moreover, we also showed L-dopa elicits profound alterations in the activity of three LID molecular markers, namely DR1/PKA/P-tau (ser396). These modifications are totally prevented by LBM treatment, a similar way to achieve continuous dopaminergic delivery (CDD). In conclusion, our experiments provided evidence that intermittent administration of L-dopa, but not continuous delivery, and DR1/PKA/p-tau (ser396) activation played a critical role in the molecular and behavioural induction of LID in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. In addition, LBM treatment prevented the development of LID by inhibiting the expression of DR1/PKA/p-tau, as well as PPEB mRNA in dyskintic rats."

Basic aspects and recent advances in the understanding of the pharmacological mechanism of action of the clinically most used antiparkinson drugs are reviewed. Recent human and animal biochemical investigations clearly confirm and extend previous findings indicating that benserazide is much more potent than carbidopa as peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. L-DOPA in combination with benserazide or carbidopa constitutes the best available therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). To reduce peaks and rapid fluctuations of L-DOPA plasma levels (possibly responsible for peak-dose dyskinesias and end-of-dose deterioration) a slow-release formulation of L-DOPA in combination with benserazide or with benserazide plus catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors should be developed. In parkinsonian patients under long-term L-DOPA therapy monoamine oxidase inhibitors type B (MAO-B) e.g. (-)deprenyl and direct dopamine receptor agonists (bromocriptine, lisuride, pergolide etc.), due to their L-DOPA-sparing effects, alleviate in some cases L-DOPA-induced side-effects e.g. dyskinesias and on-off phenomena. However, since (-)deprenyl, due to its metabolism to (-)methamphetamine and (-)amphetamine, seem to have indirect sympathomimetic activity, new selective MAO-B inhibitors devoid of indirect sympathomimetic effects should be tested clinically to assess the functional role of pure MAO-B inhibition in the therapy of PD. The auxiliary therapy with direct dopamine receptor agonists of the D-2 subtype represents another valid approach which should be further investigated in order to find novel dopamine agonists, less expensive than bromocriptine, and strictly selective for D-2 receptor sites."

L-DOPA provides the most potent medication to treat Parkinson's disease, and such systemic treatment is usually combined with a peripheral amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor to amplify its central effectiveness. Since L-DOPA can lose its efficacy or can lead to adverse effects with prolonged application, current pharmacokinetic and dynamic research is aimed at improving the drug's applicability. In a previous study, performed with in vivo microdialysis in the anesthetized rat, we have shown that intranasal L-DOPA administration (without prior decarboxylase inhibition) can increase extracellular dopamine levels in the neostriatum. Using similar experimental conditions in the present experiment, we tested the neurochemical effects of L-DOPA treatment in combination with the peripheral amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor benserazide. In accordance with other data, it was found that the combination of i.p. benserazide and i.p. L-DOPA led to pronounced increases of extracellular levels of dopamine, dihydroxyplenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in the neostriatum, whereas i.p. L-DOPA alone only moderately increased dopamine, but strongly increased the metabolite levels. Furthermore, increased dopamine levels, and weaker increases of dihydroxyplenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid were observed after i.p. benserazide followed by intranasal L-DOPA. Finally, we found that i.p. benserazide alone can lead to pronounced increases in neostriatal dopamine and moderate increases of dihydroxyplenylacetic acid levels, whereas it did not affect homovanillic acid. Thus, not only the combination of L-DOPA (i.p. or intranasal) with the presumed peripheral L-DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor benserazide, but also each component alone can affect dopamine activity in the brain. Especially the findings with benserazide treatment might be of relevance for understanding the mechanisms of current L-DOPA therapy, since they indicate that part of the treatment's actions may possibly be determined by central dopaminergic effects of the accompanying amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor."

BACKGROUND Porphyromonas gingivalis produces outer membrane-attached proteins that include the virulence-associated cysteine proteinases RgpA and RgpB (Arg-gingipains) and Kgp (Lys-gingipain). The gingipains provide P. gingivalis with a general proteolytic tool for degradation of proteinaceous nutrients for growth. They are also essential for the processing and maturation of the major fimbriae (FimA) which are important in facilitating bacterial adhesion to host tissues. FimA has been characterized as an important virulence factor for P. gingivalis, and many studies, both animal experiments and clinical investigations, have characterized fimA genotypes II, Ib, and IV to be associated with disease (periodontitis and cardiovascular disease) while genotypes I, III, and V represent avirulent strains. The relationship between virulence and gene variation of the rgpB gene has not been investigated extensively. However, nucleotide variations of the rgpB gene result in four amino acid substitutions in the catalytic domain identifying five different rgpB genotypes. They are named according to the different amino acid sequences in the primary protein structure of RGPB and named NYPN, NSSN, NSSK, NYPK, and DYPN (Beikler et al. 2005). AIM The aim of the present study is to elucidate a possible relationship between fimA virulent and avirulent genotypes to the corresponding rgpB genotypes. METHODS The total length of the rgpB (2212 bp) and fimA genes (1140 bp) from 20 clinical isolates was sequenced. Primers for pcr and sequencing of the genes were selected according to earlier investigations. RESULTS The rgpB genotypes, NSSN and NYPN (n=2 and 6, respectively), were detected in the fimA II genotypes of P. gingivalis, while NSSK was detected in one fimA Ib genotype in the population. For the eight fimA IV genotypes, five NSSK and three NSSN rgpB genotypes were detected. In two fima I genotypes were detected one DYPN and one NYPN of the rgpB variants, while one fimA III genotype was associated with NSSK. CONCLUSION The rgpB genotypes NSSN, NYPN, NSSK of P. gingivalis may be associated with the virulent fimA genotypes II, Ib and IV, indicating a possible connection to their virulent properties."

Its colonization on oral surfaces is a necessary first step leading to infection. FimA, a subunit protein of major (long) fimbriae, is a well-known virulence factor. Based on its nucleotide sequence, FimA is classified into several genotypes. We compared here the transcriptional levels of the fimA gene in several P. gingivalis strains using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, fimbrial display on the P. gingivalis surface using transmission electronic microscopy, and the adherence competencies of P. gingivalis strains carrying different types of FimAs towards saliva and Streptococcus gordonii surfaces using mutagenesis analysis. We demonstrated differential expression of each fimA gene in these P. gingivalis strains. A correlation of the transcription level of fimA and binding activity of P. gingivalis was revealed. We show that P. gingivalis strains with genotype I and II of FimA are efficient in interaction with saliva or S. gordonii. This work highlights the important role of FimA type I and II in P. gingivalis attachment to oral surfaces."

BACKGROUND The microbiologic feature of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) in Chinese patients has not yet been determined. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of eight periodontal microorganisms and the distribution of the Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotype in a cohort of Chinese patients with AgP. METHODS Saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 81 patients with AgP (25 with incisor-first molar type and 56 with generalized type [GAgP]) and 34 periodontally healthy controls. Eight periodontal microorganisms, including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, the distribution of fimA genotypes was assessed in P. gingivalis-positive individuals by PCR. RESULTS The prevalence of P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola, C. rectus, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with AgP was significantly higher than that in healthy controls. The prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with GAgP was relatively low (30.4%) compared with other pathogens. Results of logistic regression analysis showed that younger patients were more likely to harbor A. actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio = 2.85). Type II was the most prevalent fimA genotype of P. gingivalis in patients with AgP. CONCLUSIONS P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola, C. rectus, P. intermedia, and F. nucleatum were the predominant periodontal pathogens of patients with GAgP in China. Type II of fimA was the most prevalent genotype of P. gingivalis in patients with AgP. The prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with GAgP was relatively low."

Increasing evidence has shown periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.gingivalis) infection contributes to atherosclerosis (AS) progression. P.gingivalis fimbriae act as an important virulence factor in AS. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) may play a crucial role in autoimmune response during this process. However, whether P.gingivalis infection is associated with Tregs dysregulation during AS is still unknown and the prevalence of different P.gingivalis FimA genotypes during this process is unclear. Here we analyzed the distribution of Tregs and in P.gingivalis-infected atherosclerotic patients to reveal the relationship between P.gingivalis infection and Tregs reduction/dysfunction and to elucidate their role in periodontitis-AS interaction. FimA genotype was also examined to determine the prevalence of fimbriae. Our results showed that P.gingivalis infection reduced Tregs in atherosclerotic patients compared with non-atherosclerotic patients and health controls. Concentration of TGF-\u03b21, which plays an important role in the development of Tregs, also decreased in P.gingivalis infected patients. Furthermore, type II FimA seems to show higher prevalence than the other five detected types. The population of Tregs further decreased in patients with type II FimA compared with the other types. P.gingivlias FimA genotype II was the dominant type associated with decreased Treg population. These results indicate that P.gingivalis infection may be associated with Tregs dysregulation in AS; type II FimA may be a predominant genotype in this process."

We aimed to evaluate the relationship between the condition of peri-implant tissue and the distribution of P. gingivalis fimA genotypes in Koreans using a new primer. METHODS A total of 248 plaque samples were taken from the peri-implant sulci of 184 subjects. The control group consisted of sound implants with a peri-implant probing depth (PD) of 5 mm or less with no bleeding on probing (BOP). Test group I consisted of implants with a peri-implant PD of 5 mm or less and BOP, and test group II consisted of implants with a peri-implant PD of more than 5 mm and BOP. DNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed a using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with P. gingivalis-specific primers, followed by an additional PCR assay to differentiate the fimA genotypes in P. gingivalis-positive subjects. RESULTS The Prevalence of P. gingivalis in each group did not significantly differ (P>0.05). The most predominant fimA genotype in all groups was type II. The prevalence of type Ib fimA was significantly greater in test group II than in the control group (P<0.05).

METHODS Subgingival samples were collected from 151 people exhibiting diverse periodontal condition. The occurrence of P. gingivalis, FimA genotypes and other bacteria was determined by PCR. RESULTS P. gingivalis was positive in 85 patients. Genotype FimA II was more prevalent without reach significant differences among study groups (54.3%), FimA IV was also prevalent in gingivitis (13.0%). A high correlation (p= 0.000) was found among P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia co-infection. The FimA II genotype correlated with concomitant detection of T. denticola and T. forsythia. CONCLUSIONS Porphyromonas gingivalis was high even in the healthy group at the study population. A trend toward a greater frequency of FimA II genotype in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis was determined.

BACKGROUND Viliuisk encephalomyelitis is a disorder that starts, in most cases, as an acute meningoencephalitis. Survivors of the acute phase develop a slowly progressing neurologic syndrome characterized by dementia, dysarthria, and spasticity. An epidemic of this disease has been spreading throughout the Yakut Republic of the Russian Federation. Although clinical, neuropathologic, and epidemiologic data suggest infectious etiology, multiple attempts at pathogen isolation have been unsuccessful. METHODS Detailed clinical, pathologic, laboratory, and epidemiologic studies have identified 414 patients with definite Viliuisk encephalomyelitis in 15 of 33 administrative regions of the Yakut Republic between 1940 and 1999. All data are documented in a Registry. RESULTS The average annual Viliuisk encephalomyelitis incidence rate at the height of the epidemic reached 8.8 per 100,000 population and affected predominantly young adults. The initial outbreak occurred in a remote isolated area of the middle reaches of Viliui River; the disease spread to adjacent areas and further in the direction of more densely populated regions. The results suggest that intensified human migration from endemic villages led to the emergence of this disease in new communities. Recent social and demographic changes have presumably contributed to a subsequent decline in disease incidence. CONCLUSIONS Based on the largest known set of diagnostically verified Viliuisk encephalomyelitis cases, we demonstrate how a previously little-known disease that was endemic in a small indigenous population subsequently reached densely populated areas and produced an epidemic involving hundreds of persons."

The disease is characterized neuropathologically by multiple widespread micronecrotic foci with marked inflammatory reactions and subsequent gliosis throughout the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum and brain stem.

Since the discovery of Viliuisk encephalomyelitis (VE) in 1887, scientists have tried to understand the natural history and aetiology of this endemic neurological disorder among the native Sakha population of Central Siberia. Familial aggregation and segregation analysis suggested a genetic influence on VE incidence. However, recent studies have implicated an unknown virus, possibly from the alpha herpesvirus family, as a possible cause for this disease. As VE is a neurological disease characterized by the inflammatory reactions systematically observed in the spinocerebellar fluid and in the brain tissue of deceased patients, we examined 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across seven inflammation-related candidate gene regions, including chemokine receptors type 2 and 5 (CCR2/CCR5), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-10, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF) and chemokine regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES). Our main objective was to analyse the degree of genetic association between VE and candidate genes that have been previously implicated in other inflammatory diseases. Samples were collected from 83 affected families comprising 88 verified VE cases, 156 family members, and an additional 69 unrelated, unaffected inhabitants of the same geographical area. This collection included substantially all of the cases that are currently on the VE Registry. The experimental design included both case-control and transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT)-based familial association analyses. None of 17 SNPs analysed was significantly associated with VE occurrence. Exclusion of these eight genes based on the lack of association has important implications for identifying the disease agent, as well as prescribing therapy and understanding Viliuisk encephalomyelitis."

Death occurs within 3 to 6 months in subacute cases and within 6 years in the slowly progressive cases. Chronic cases lack a subacute phase but show a slowly progressive dementia associated with bradykinesia, dysarthria and spastic paraparesis that stabilizes late in the disease process. In subacute and slowly progressive cases, focal necrotizing encephalomyelitis is seen at necropsy. Chronic cases show multifocal areas of lysis with a gliotic margin, predominantly within grey matter, lacking associated chronic inflammatory changes seen in the other forms of the disease.

BACKGROUND Viliuisk encephalomyelitis (VE) is an endemic neurological disease in Northeast Siberia and generally considered to be a chronic encephalomyelitis of unknown origin actually spreading in the Sakha (Yakutian) Republic. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPLE FINDINGS In search for the pathophysiology and causative agent of VE, we performed a cross-sectional study on clinical, serological and neuroimaging data on chronic VE patients during two medical expeditions to three villages within the Viliuiski river basin in the Republic of Sakha in 2000 and to the capital Yakutsk in 2006. The severity of the core clinical picture with predominant sensory ataxia, gait apraxia, lower limb spasticity, cognitive impairment and bladder dysfunction correlated with the degree of MRI findings showing enlargement of inner ventricular spaces as in communicating hydrocephalus. Laboratory studies revealed transient eosinophilia during the preceding acute meningitis-like phase, but no ongoing inflammatory process in the CSF. We found immune reactions against Toxocara canis in the majority of chronic VE patients but rarely in controls (P = 0.025; Fisher's exact test). Histological analysis of subacute to subchronic VE brain samples showed eosinophilic infiltrations with no signs of persistent Toxocara canis infection. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE Our data showed that pressure by the communicating hydrocephalus as a mechanical factor is the major pathogenic mechanism in chronic VE, most likely triggered by eosinophilic meningitis. There are no signs for an ongoing inflammatory process in chronic VE. The past eosinophilic reaction in VE might be caused by Toxocara ssp. infection and might therefore represent the first hint for an initial cause leading to the development of chronic VE. Our data provide a framework for future studies and potential therapeutic interventions for this enigmatic epidemic neurological disease potentially spreading in Sakha Republic."

Five patients reported explosions during the recording sessions. According to the recordings, the attacks always took place when the patients were awake and relaxed. In two cases abrupt electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic changes indicating increasing alertness were recorded at the time of the reported attacks. In the remaining three cases no EEG changes were seen. Thus, there were no indications of an epileptic etiology to the condition. In all patients the symptoms ameliorated spontaneously with time.

Exploding head syndrome is characterized by the perception of loud noises during sleep-wake or wake-sleep transitions.

At present there are little systematic data on exploding head syndrome, and prevalence rates are unknown. It has been hypothesized to be rare and to occur primarily in older (i.e. 50+ years) individuals, females, and those suffering from isolated sleep paralysis. In order to test these hypotheses, 211 undergraduate students were assessed for both exploding head syndrome and isolated sleep paralysis using semi-structured diagnostic interviews: 18.00% of the sample experienced lifetime exploding head syndrome, this reduced to 16.60% for recurrent cases. Though not more common in females, it was found in 36.89% of those diagnosed with isolated sleep paralysis. Exploding head syndrome episodes were accompanied by clinically significant levels of fear, and a minority (2.80%) experienced it to such a degree that it was associated with clinically significant distress and/or impairment. Contrary to some earlier theorizing, exploding head syndrome was found to be a relatively common experience in younger individuals. Given the potential clinical impacts, it is recommended that it be assessed more regularly in research and clinical settings."

CASE PRESENTATION A 57-year-old Indian male presented with four separate episodes of awakening from sleep at night after hearing a flashing sound on the right side of his head over the last 2 years. These events were described 'as if there are explosions in my head'. A neurologic examination, imaging studies, and a polysomnogram ensued, and the results led to the diagnosis of EHS.

We present the structure of the histone H4K20 methyltransferase Suv4-20h2 in complex with its histone H4 peptide substrate and S-adenosyl methionine cofactor. Analysis of the structure reveals that the Suv4-20h2 active site diverges from the canonical SET domain configuration and generates a high degree of both substrate and product specificity. Together with supporting biochemical data comparing Suv4-20h1 and Suv4-20h2, we demonstrate that the Suv4-20 family enzymes take a previously mono-methylated H4K20 substrate and generate an exclusively di-methylated product.

Using Xenopus egg extracts, we successfully reproduce maintenance DNA methylation in vitro. Dnmt1 depletion results in a marked accumulation of Uhrf1-dependent ubiquitylation of histone H3 at lysine 23. Dnmt1 preferentially associates with ubiquitylated H3 in vitro though a region previously identified as a replication foci targeting sequence. The RING finger mutant of Uhrf1 fails to recruit Dnmt1 to DNA replication sites and maintain DNA methylation in mammalian cultured cells.

PR-Set7 is required for proper cell cycle progression and is subject to degradation by the CRL4(Cdt2) ubiquitin ligase complex as a function of the cell cycle and DNA damage. This report demonstrates that PR-Set7 is an important downstream effector of CRL4(Cdt2) function during origin of DNA replication licensing, dependent on Suv4-20h1/2 activity.

The transition between proliferation and quiescence is frequently associated with changes in gene expression, extent of chromatin compaction, and histone modifications, but whether changes in chromatin state actually regulate cell cycle exit with quiescence is unclear. We find that primary human fibroblasts induced into quiescence exhibit tighter chromatin compaction. Mass spectrometry analysis of histone modifications reveals that H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 increase in quiescence and other histone modifications are present at similar levels in proliferating and quiescent cells. Analysis of cells in S, G2/M, and G1 phases shows that H4K20me1 increases after S phase and is converted to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 in quiescence. Knockdown of the enzyme that creates H4K20me3 results in an increased fraction of cells in S phase, a defect in exiting the cell cycle, and decreased chromatin compaction. Overexpression of Suv4-20h1, the enzyme that creates H4K20me2 from H4K20me1, results in G2 arrest, consistent with a role for H4K20me1 in mitosis. The results suggest that the same lysine on H4K20 may, in its different methylation states, facilitate mitotic functions in M phase and promote chromatin compaction and cell cycle exit in quiescent cells."

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains."

Mammalian DNA replication starts at distinct chromosomal sites in a tissue-specific pattern coordinated with transcription, but previous studies have not yet identified a chromatin modification that correlates with the initiation of DNA replication at particular genomic locations. Here we report that a distinct fraction of replication initiation sites in the human genome are associated with a high frequency of dimethylation of histone H3 lysine K79 (H3K79Me2). H3K79Me2-containing chromatin exhibited the highest genome-wide enrichment for replication initiation events observed for any chromatin modification examined thus far (23.39% of H3K79Me2 peaks were detected in regions adjacent to replication initiation events). The association of H3K79Me2 with replication initiation sites was independent and not synergistic with other chromatin modifications. H3K79 dimethylation exhibited wider distribution on chromatin during S-phase, but only regions with H3K79 methylation in G1 and G2 were enriched in replication initiation events. H3K79 was dimethylated in a region containing a functional replicator (a DNA sequence capable of initiating DNA replication), but the methylation was not evident in a mutant replicator that could not initiate replication. Depletion of DOT1L, the sole enzyme responsible for H3K79 methylation, triggered limited genomic over-replication although most cells could continue to proliferate and replicate DNA in the absence of methylated H3K79. Thus, prevention of H3K79 methylation might affect regulatory processes that modulate the order and timing of DNA replication. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that dimethylated H3K79 associates with some replication origins and marks replicated chromatin during S-phase to prevent re-replication and preserve genomic stability."

BACKGROUND The upcoming EXCEL trial will test the hypothesis that left main patients with SYNTAX score \u2264 32 experience similar rates of 3-year death, myocardial infarction (MI), or cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) following revascularization by PCI or CABG. METHODS We compared the 3-year rates of death/MI/CVA and death/MI/CVA/target vessel revascularization (MACCE) in 556 patients with left main disease and SYNTAX score \u2264 32 undergoing PCI (n = 285) or CABG (n = 271). To account for confounders, outcome parameters underwent extensive statistical adjustment. RESULTS The unadjusted incidence of death/MI/CVA was similar between PCI and CABG (12.7% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.892), while MACCE were higher in the PCI group compared to the CABG group (27.0% vs. 11.8%, P < 0.001). After propensity score matching, PCI was not associated with a significant increase in the rate of death/MI/CVA (11.8% vs. 10.7%, P = 0.948), while MACCE were more frequently noted among patients treated with PCI (28.8% vs. 14.1%, P = 0.002). Adjustment by means of SYNTAX score and EUROSCORE, covariates with and without propensity score, and propensity score alone did not change significantly these findings. CONCLUSIONS In an EXCEL-like cohort of patients with left main disease, there seems to be a clinical equipoise between PCI and CABG in terms of death/MI/CVA. However, even in patients with SYNTAX score \u2264 32, CABG is superior to PCI when target vessel revascularization is included in the combined endpoint."

METHODS AND RESULTS Evaluation of the Xience Everolimus Eluting Stent vs. Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization is a prospective, randomized multicenter trial designed to establish the efficacy and safety of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the everolimus-eluting stent compared with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in subjects with unprotected left-main coronary artery (ULMCA) disease and low-intermediate anatomical SYNTAX scores (<33). After completion of patient recruitment in EXCEL, the SYNTAX Score II was prospectively applied to predict 4-year mortality in the CABG and PCI arms. The 95% prediction intervals (PIs) for mortality were computed using simulation with bootstrap resampling (10 000 times). For the entire study cohort, the 4-year predicted mortalities were 8.5 and 10.5% in the PCI and CABG arms, respectively [odds ratios (OR) 0.79; 95% PI 0.43-1.50). In subjects with low (\u226422) anatomical SYNTAX scores, the predicted OR was 0.69 (95% PI 0.34-1.45); in intermediate anatomical SYNTAX scores (23-32), the predicted OR was 0.93 (95% PI 0.53-1.62). Based on 4-year mortality predictions in EXCEL, clinical characteristics shifted long-term mortality predictions either in favour of PCI (older age, male gender and COPD) or CABG (younger age, lower creatinine clearance, female gender, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction). CONCLUSION The SYNTAX Score II indicates at least an equipoise for long-term mortality between CABG and PCI in subjects with ULMCA disease up to an intermediate anatomical complexity. Both anatomical and clinical characteristics had a clear impact on long-term mortality predictions and decision making between CABG and PCI."

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the gold standard for the treatment of left main disease, whereas percutaneous coronary intervention is a viable option for patients who are candidates for revascularization but ineligible for CABG. CABG is limited by extended hospital stay followed by rehabilitation and mediocre long-term patency of saphenous vein grafts. Drug-eluting stents decrease the restenosis rates compared with bare metal stents and provide comparable clinical outcomes with those of CABG. Patients with isolated left main disease limited to the ostium or midbody are most likely to have good clinical outcomes with low restenosis and stent thrombosis rates.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW The aim of this article is to review the current revascularization strategies in patients presenting with unprotected left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD). RECENT FINDINGS Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the current standard of treatment for patients with LMCAD. The development and refinement of techniques increased the number of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in LMCAD patients. SUMMARY Although several observational studies show comparable results of CABG and/or PCI in patients with LMCAD, there is currently no convincing randomized evidence that either one of the two is associated with better long-term survival. Recent meta-analyses of four small randomized trials revealed a similar rate of 1-year major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, higher rates of target vessel revascularization and lower stroke rates for PCI. Pooling randomized patients studies stratified by lesion complexity strengthened the hypothesis that CABG is better in more complex LMCAD patients. However, the randomized comparisons are affected by methodological limitations and lack power to be conclusive. The ongoing Evaluation of XIENCE V Everolimus Eluting Stent System Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) trial is expected to provide a better answer on the optimal treatment strategy for LMCAD patients. In the meantime, risk models need to be improved and the most appropriate revascularization strategy for the individual LMCAD patient should be chosen using a multidisciplinary heart team that considers not only risk models but also other clinical and economic facets."

AIMS Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is the standard of care for revascularisation of patients with left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD). Recent studies have suggested that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) may provide comparable outcomes in selected patients with LMCAD without extensive CAD. We therefore designed a trial to investigate whether PCI with XIENCE cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents (CoCr-EES) would result in non-inferior or superior clinical outcomes to CABG in selected patients with LMCAD. METHODS AND RESULTS The Evaluation of XIENCE versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) trial is a prospective, open-label, multicentre, international study of 1,900 randomised subjects. Patients with significant LMCAD with a SYNTAX score \u226432 and local Heart Team consensus that the subject is appropriate for revascularisation by both PCI and CABG are consented and randomised 1:1 to undergo PCI using CoCr-EES or CABG. All patients undergo follow-up for five years. The primary endpoint is the three-year composite rate of death, stroke or myocardial infarction, assessed at a median follow-up of at least three years (with at least two-year follow-up in all patients), powered for sequential non-inferiority and superiority testing. CONCLUSIONS The EXCEL study will define the contemporary roles of CABG and PCI using XIENCE CoCr-EES in patients with LMCAD disease with low and intermediate SYNTAX scores."

Refinement of interventional techniques, adjunctive pharmacological therapy, and the introduction of drug eluting stents have fostered new interest for the percutaneous treatment of unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) stenosis. Several observational registries, some randomized controlled trials and several meta-analyses have consistently shown no difference in mortality and myocardial infarction between percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in patients with ULMCA stenosis, but a higher rate of target vessel revascularization in patients treated with PCI. As a consequence, PCI of ULMCA stenosis has been upgraded to class IIa or IIb indication in the current European or American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guidelines. Although these results are promising, they do not still represent enough evidence for extending PCI of ULMCA stenosis to current clinical practice. The EXCEL trial will address the value of PCI in relation to CABG for the treatment of ULMCA stenosis in more than 2000 patients. A major breakthrough of the SYNTAX trial has been the demonstration of an interaction between the coronary complexity and the revascularization strategy, suggesting that optimal risk stratification is a key element when deciding the best strategy of revascularization in this high-risk group of patients. Multidisciplinary team approach remains essential to provide a balanced information to the patient and to offer the beast treatment option."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether epigenetic regulation of the BDNF gene is a biomarker of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) development among veterans exposed to combat in the Vietnam War. METHODS Using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, combat veterans were grouped into those with (n = 126) and without (n = 122) PTSD. DNA methylation levels at four CpG sites within the BDNF promoter I region were quantified in the peripheral blood using pyrosequencing. The effects of BDNF DNA methylation levels and clinical variables on the diagnosis of PTSD were tested using binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Subjects with PTSD showed a higher DNA methylation of four CpG sites at the BDNF promoter compared with those without PTSD. High methylation levels at the BDNF promoter CpG site, high combat exposure, and alcohol problems were significantly associated with PTSD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated an association between higher DNA methylation of the BDNF promoter and PTSD diagnosis in combat-exposed individuals.

Here we investigate PTSD-associated methylation differences in 33 genes previously shown to differ in whole blood-derived gene expression levels between those with vs. without the disorder. Drawing on DNA samples similarly obtained from whole blood in 100 individuals, 23 with and 77 without lifetime PTSD, we used methylation microarray data to assess whether these 33 candidate genes showed epigenetic signatures indicative of increased risk for, or resilience to, PTSD. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the main and interacting effects of candidate genes' methylation values and number of potentially traumatic events (PTEs), adjusting for age and other covariates. Results revealed that only one candidate gene - MAN2C1} - showed a significant methylation x PTE interaction, such that those with both higher MAN2C1 methylation and greater exposure to PTEs showed a marked increase in risk of lifetime PTSD (OR 4.35, 95% CI: 1.07, 17.77, p=0.04).

BACKGROUND Epigenetic differences exist between trauma-exposed individuals with and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear whether these epigenetic differences pre-exist, or arise following, trauma and PTSD onset. METHOD In pre- and post-trauma samples from a subset of Detroit Neighborhood Health Study participants, DNA methylation (DNAm) was measured at DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT3L. Pre-trauma DNAm differences and changes in DNAm from pre- to post-trauma were assessed between and within PTSD cases (n = 30) and age-, gender- and trauma exposure-matched controls (n = 30). Pre-trauma DNAm was tested for association with post-trauma symptom severity (PTSS) change. Potential functional consequences of DNAm differences were explored via bioinformatic search for putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). RESULTS DNMT1 DNAm increased following trauma in PTSD cases (p = 0.001), but not controls (p = 0.067). DNMT3A and DNMT3B DNAm increased following trauma in both cases (DNMT3A: p = 0.009; DNMT3B: p < 0.001) and controls (DNMT3A: p = 0.002; DNMT3B: p < 0.001). In cases only, pre-trauma DNAm was lower at a DNMT3B CpG site that overlaps with a TFBS involved in epigenetic regulation (p = 0.001); lower pre-trauma DNMT3B DNAm at this site was predictive of worsening of PTSS post-trauma (p = 0.034). Some effects were attenuated following correction for multiple hypothesis testing. CONCLUSIONS DNAm among trauma-exposed individuals shows both longitudinal changes and pre-existing epigenetic states that differentiate individuals who are resilient versus susceptible to PTSD. These distinctive DNAm differences within DNMT loci may contribute to genome-wide epigenetic profiles of PTSD."

Total Life Stress (TLS) was also assessed in all subjects. We evaluated DNA extracted from peripheral blood using the HumanMethylation27 BeadChip and analyzed both global and site-specific methylation. Methylation levels were examined for association with PTSD, child abuse history, and TLS using a linear mixed model adjusted for age, sex, and chip effects. Global methylation was increased in subjects with PTSD. CpG sites in five genes (TPR, CLEC9A, APC5, ANXA2, and TLR8) were differentially methylated in subjects with PTSD. Additionally, a CpG site in NPFFR2 was associated with TLS after adjustment for multiple testing. Notably, many of these genes have been previously associated with inflammation.

Increased SKA2 methylation was significantly associated with lower cortisol stress reactivity in 85 healthy individuals exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (B=-173.40, t=-2.324, p-value=0.023).

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given psychosocial stress composed of two acute cat exposures in conjunction with 31 days of daily social instability. These manipulations have been shown previously to produce physiological and behavioral sequelae in rats that are comparable to symptoms observed in traumatized people with PTSD. We then assessed Bdnf DNA methylation patterns (at exon IV) and gene expression. We have found here that the psychosocial stress regimen significantly increased Bdnf DNA methylation in the dorsal hippocampus, with the most robust hypermethylation detected in the dorsal CA1 subregion. Conversely, the psychosocial stress regimen significantly decreased methylation in the ventral hippocampus (CA3). No changes in Bdnf DNA methylation were detected in the medial prefrontal cortex or basolateral amygdala. In addition, there were decreased levels of Bdnf mRNA in both the dorsal and ventral CA1. These results provide evidence that traumatic stress occurring in adulthood can induce CNS gene methylation, and specifically, support the hypothesis that epigenetic marking of the Bdnf gene may underlie hippocampal dysfunction in response to traumatic stress.

Interaction of SKA2 with stress predicted suicidal behavior with ~80% accuracy.

METHODS This study evaluated associations between PTSD and DNA methylation (DNAm) age using recently developed algorithms of cellular age by Horvath (2013) and Hannum et al. (2013). These estimates reflect accelerated aging when they exceed chronological age. We also examined if accelerated cellular age manifested in degraded neural integrity, indexed via diffusion tensor imaging. RESULTS Among 281 male and female veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, DNAm age was strongly related to chronological age (rs \u223c.88). Lifetime PTSD severity was associated with Hannum DNAm age estimates residualized for chronological age (\u03b2=.13, p=.032). Advanced DNAm age was associated with reduced integrity in the genu of the corpus callosum (\u03b2=-.17, p=.009) and indirectly linked to poorer working memory performance via this region (indirect \u03b2=-.05, p=.029). Horvath DNAm age estimates were not associated with PTSD or neural integrity.

In the present study we investigated whether changes in DNA methylation are associated with the effects of traumatic stressor, using a validated PTSD rat model. Screening of genomic DNA methylation patterns revealed that maladaptation to traumatic stress is associated with numerous changes in the methylation pattern of rat hippocampus. Of the differentially methylated genes revealed by this global screening, Disks Large-Associated Protein (Dlgap2) was of special interest, demonstrating an increase in a specific methylation site which was associated with a reduction in its gene expression in PTSD-like compared to non-PTSD-like rats. The association between the methylation rate and Dlgap2 expression was further substantiated by re-dividing the rats according to their methylation state. A significantly higher expression was observed in the non-methylated compared to methylated rats. In addition, taking all rats as one group revealed a significant correlation between their behavioural stress responses and Dlgap2 transcript levels.

This review will focus on newfound interactions of autophagy and pathogenic bacteria, highlighting that, in addition to delivering bacteria to the lysosome, autophagy responding to bacterial invasion may have a much broader role in mediating disease outcome."

Autophagy, a form of lysosomal degradation capable of eliminating dysfunctional proteins and organelles, is a cellular process associated with homeostasis. Autophagy functions in cell survival by breaking down proteins and organelles and recycling them to meet metabolic demands. However, aberrant up regulation of autophagy can function as an alternative to apoptosis. The duality of autophagy, and its regulation over cell survival/death, intimately links it with human disease. Non-coding RNAs regulate mRNA levels and elicit diverse effects on mammalian protein expression. The most studied non-coding RNAs to-date are microRNAs (miRNA). MicroRNAs function in post-transcriptional regulation, causing profound changes in protein levels, and affect many biological processes and diseases. The role and regulation of autophagy, whether it is beneficial or harmful, is a controversial topic in cardiovascular disease. A number of recent studies have identified miRNAs that target autophagy-related proteins and influence the development, progression, or treatment of cardiovascular disease. Understanding the mechanisms by which these miRNAs work can provide promising insight and potential progress towards the development of therapeutic treatments in cardiovascular disease."

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an enveloped Flavivirus with a positive-sense RNA genome, causes acute encephalitis with high mortality in humans. We used a virulent (RP-9) and an attenuated (RP-2ms) JEV strain to assess the role of autophagy in JEV infection. By monitoring the levels of lipidated LC3, we found that autophagy was induced in human NT-2 cells infected with RP-2ms, especially at the late stage, and to a lesser extent with RP-9. The induction of autophagy by rapamycin increased viral production, whereas the inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine reduced viral yields for both RP-9 and RP-2ms. The viral replication of RP-9 and RP-2ms was also reduced in cells with downregulated ATG5 or Beclin 1 expression, suggesting a proviral role of autophagy in JEV replication. To determine the step of JEV life cycle affected by autophagy, we used an mCherry-LC3 fusion protein as the autophagosome marker. Little of no colocalization of LC3 puncta with dsRNA was noted, whereas the input JEV particles were targeted to autophagosomes stained positive for early endosome marker. Overall, we show for the first time that the cellular autophagy process is involved in JEV infection and the inoculated viral particles traffic to autophagosomes for subsequent steps of viral infection."

Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated catabolic process involving the degradation of intracellular contents (e.g., proteins and organelles) as well as invading microbes (e.g., parasites, bacteria and viruses). Multiple forms of cellular stress can stimulate this pathway, including nutritional imbalances, oxygen deprivation, immunological response, genetic defects, chromosomal anomalies and cytotoxic stress. Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) are released by stressed cells undergoing autophagy or injury, and act as endogenous danger signals to regulate the subsequent inflammatory and immune response. A complex relationship exists between DAMPs and autophagy in cellular adaption to injury and unscheduled cell death. Since both autophagy and DAMPs are important for pathogenesis of human disease, it is crucial to understand how they interplay to sustain homeostasis in stressful or dangerous environments."

Although autophagy is considered a dynamic system responsible for cellular renovation and homeostasis under physiological conditions, it is increasingly clear that autophagy is directly relevant to clinical disease. During disease progression, autophagy not only serves as a cellular protective mechanism but also can represent a harmful event under certain conditions. In addition, although autophagy can act as a nonselective bulk degradation process, recent research shows that autophagy can selectively degrade specific proteins, organelles, and invading bacteria, in processes termed \"selective autophagy.\" Selective autophagy has drawn the attention of researchers because of its potential importance in clinical diseases. In this article, we outline the most recent studies implicating autophagy and selective autophagy in human lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and sepsis. We also discuss the relationship between autophagy and other molecular mechanisms related to disease progression, including programmed necrosis (necroptosis) and the inflammasome, an inflammatory signaling platform that regulates the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Finally, we examine the dual nature of autophagy and selective autophagy in the lung, which have both protective and injurious effects for human lung disease."

Autophagy and the effects of its inhibition or induction were investigated during the entire infectious cycle of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a human herpesvirus. As a baseline, we first enumerated the number of autophagosomes per cell after VZV infection compared with the number after induction of autophagy following serum starvation or treatment with tunicamycin or trehalose. Punctum induction by VZV was similar in degree to punctum induction by trehalose in uninfected cells. Treatment of infected cells with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) markedly reduced the viral titer, as determined by assays measuring both cell-free virus and infectious foci (P < 0.0001). We next examined a virion-enriched band purified by density gradient sedimentation and observed that treatment with 3-MA decreased the amount of VZV gE, while treatment with trehalose increased the amount of gE in the same band. Because VZV gE is the most abundant glycoprotein, we selected gE as a representative viral glycoprotein. To further investigate the role of autophagy in VZV glycoprotein biosynthesis as well as confirm the results obtained with 3-MA inhibition, we transfected cells with ATG5 small interfering RNA to block autophagosome formation. VZV-induced syncytium formation was markedly reduced by ATG5 knockdown (P < 0.0001). Further, we found that both expression and glycan processing of VZV gE were decreased after ATG5 knockdown, while expression of the nonglycosylated IE62 tegument protein was unchanged. Taken together, our cumulative results not only documented abundant autophagy within VZV-infected cells throughout the infectious cycle but also demonstrated that VZV-induced autophagy facilitated VZV glycoprotein biosynthesis and processing."

Autophagy, a cellular degradation process, has been proposed to be one of these senescence effectors, although its functional relevance seems highly context dependent (Hoare et al., Semin Cancer Biol 21:397-404, 2011).

BACKGROUND Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Despite multimodal therapies, almost all GBM recur within a narrow margin around the initial resected lesion. Thus, novel therapeutic intensification strategies must target both, the population of dispersed tumor cells around the cavity and the postoperative microenvironment. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a pragmatic and effective approach to sterilize the margins from persistent tumor cells, abrogate post-injury proliferative stimuli and to bridge the therapeutic gap between surgery and radiochemotherapy. Therefore, we have set up INTRAGO, a phase I/II dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IORT added to standard therapy in newly diagnosed GBM. In contrast to previous approaches, the study involves the application of isotropic low-energy (kV) x-rays delivered by spherical applicators, providing optimal irradiation properties to the resection cavity. METHODS/DESIGN INTRAGO includes patients aged 50 years or older with a Karnofsky performance status of at least 50% and a histologically confirmed (frozen sections) supratentorial GBM. Safety and tolerability (i.e., the maximum tolerated dose, MTD) will be assessed using a classical 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are wound healing deficits or infections requiring surgical intervention, IORT-related cerebral bleeding or ischemia, symptomatic brain necrosis requiring surgical intervention and early termination of external beam radiotherapy (before the envisaged dose of 60 Gy) due to radiotoxicity. Secondary end points are progression-free and overall survival. TRIAL REGISTRATION The study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number: NCT02104882 (Registration Date: 03/26/2014)."

We performed intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in 19 patients with various brain tumors. IORT was given for primary tumors in 2 patients with malignant glioma, but was used for treating recurrent tumors in the other 17 patients. The former 2 patients respectively received 33 Gy by IORT alone and 30 Gy by IORT in combination with 50 Gy of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and survived for 12 and 9 months. The latter 17 patients had received EBRT at 4 to 112 months before IORT. In this group, single doses of 23-40 Gy were delivered by IORT after removing as much tumor as possible. The median survival time after IORT was 12 months for 9 patients with glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma, while it was 51 months for 8 patients with less infiltrative tumors (ependymoma, anaplastic ependymoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma). One patient with ependymoma and another with anaplastic ependymoma are currently alive with no evidence of disease at 7 and 11 years after IORT, respectively. Symptomatic brain necrosis occurred in 3 patients following IORT, but the symptoms were relieved in 2 of them by the removal of necrotic brain tissue. It is concluded that IORT combined with extensive tumor removal has an acceptable toxicity in previously irradiated patients and can be effective for selected recurrent malignant brain tumors."

METHODS Eighty-three consecutive adult patients (50 men; mean age 60 years) with newly diagnosed supratentorial primary glioblastomas that underwent surgical resection with intraoperative carmustine wafers implantation (n = 7.1 \u00b1 1.7) were retrospectively studied. RESULTS The median overall survival (OS) was 15.8 months with 56 patients dying over the course of the study. There was no significant association between the number of implanted carmustine wafers and complication rates (four surgical site infections, one death). The OS was significantly longer in Stupp regimen patients (19.5 months) as compared with patients with other postoperative treatments (13 months; p = 0.002). In addition patients with eight or more implanted carmustine wafers survived longer (24.5 months) than patients with seven or less implanted wafers (13 months; p = 0.021). Finally, regardless of the number of carmustine wafers, median OS was significantly longer in patients with a subtotal or total resection (21.5 months) than in patients with a partial resection (13 months; p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS The intraoperative use of carmustine wafers in combination with Stupp regimen is a viable first-line treatment option of glioblastomas.

BACKGROUND Even after surgery and radiotherapy, malignant gliomas still have a poor prognosis. The authors report on their experience with IORT in 71 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS From May 1992 to February 2004, 71 patients with malignant gliomas were treated with IORT. 26 patients suffered from grade III gliomas, 45 patients from glioblastomas (GBM). IORT was carried out using a standard electron tube and 9- to 18-MeV electrons. 52/71 patients who were primarily treated received 20 Gy IORT + 60 Gy postoperative radiotherapy, 19/71 patients with recurrences only received IORT (20-25 Gy). RESULTS The complication rates were 1.4% for wound infections and 5.6% for hemorrhage. Median disease-specific survival amounted to 14.9 months (gliomas III) and 14.2 months (GBM). The 2-year survival rates amounted to 26.9% (gliomas III) and 6.8% (GBM; p = 0.0296). Total versus subtotal resection had no significant influence on survival (p = 0.0741), nor had age, sex, tumor site, performance status, size, primary versus recurrence, and radiation dose. A comparison to a conventionally treated patient group did not show a significant survival improvement. 3 months after treatment, initial symptoms had improved in 59% (hemiparesis), 50% (aphasia), 50% (hemianopsia), and 60% (convulsions). CONCLUSION IORT has been shown to be feasible; perioperative complication rates were not increased. Survival was generally not improved compared to a historical control group.

PURPOSE Feasibility and morbidity of IORT for malignant brain tumors as well as value of innovative imaging for diagnosis of rest tumors and recurrences were examined. METHODS AND MATERIALS Between May 1992 and November 1993, 23 patients with malignant brain tumors were treated in M\u00fcnster with IORT. The patient collective was heterogeneous and negatively selected, i.e. beside of primary treatments, also patients with extensive previous treatment, recurrent tumors or metastases were included. Therapy consisted of radical surgical resection and intraoperative electron radiotherapy using total doses from 15 Gy to 25 Gy relative to the 90% isodose. Afterwards, patients without prior treatment underwent percutaneous irradiation with a maximum dose of 60 Gy, related to the small volume of the tumor area plus a safety margin of 2 cm. RESULTS No increase of peri-operative morbidity or subacute sequelae was observed. Overall 1-year survival was 67% for grade III gliomas (WHO), and 56% for glioblastoma multiforme. When the Matsutani selection criteria (primary therapy of a supratentorial, peripheral astrocytoma grade III or glioblastoma smaller than 5 cm in diameter with a Karnofsky performance index of more than 60% and possible wide resection) were applied, 1-year survival increased to 75%. Nuclear medical diagnostics using 123I-alpha-methyltyrosin SPECT proved a valuable method for imaging of non-resectable tumor tissue and diagnosis of recurrences.

Mutations in the PCNA-binding site of CDKN1C significantly increase CDKN1C protein stability and prevent cell cycle progression into the S phase.

Genomic imprinting is an epigenetically regulated mechanism leading to parental-origin allele-specific expression. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disease related to 11p15.5 genetic and epigenetic alterations, among them loss-of-function CDKN1C mutations. Intriguing is that CDKN1C gain-of-function variations were recently found in patients with IMAGe syndrome (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and genital anomalies). BWS and IMAGe share an imprinted mode of inheritance; familial analysis demonstrated the presence of the phenotype exclusively when the mutant CDKN1C allele is inherited from the mother. Interestingly, both IMAGe and BWS are characterized by growth disturbances, although with opposite clinical phenotypes; IMAGe patients display growth restriction whereas BWS patients display overgrowth. CDKN1C codifies for CDKN1C/KIP2, a nuclear protein and potent tight-binding inhibitor of several cyclin/Cdk complexes, playing a role in maintenance of the nonproliferative state of cells. The mirror phenotype of BWS and IMAGe can be, at least in part, explained by the effect of mutations on protein functions. All the IMAGe-associated mutations are clustered in the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-binding domain of CDKN1C and cause a dramatic increase in the stability of the protein, which probably results in a functional gain of growth inhibition properties. In contrast, BWS mutations are not clustered within a single domain, are loss-of-function, and promote cell proliferation. CDKN1C is an example of allelic heterogeneity associated with opposite syndromes."

OBJECTIVE Arboleda et al. have recently shown that IMAGe (intra-uterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital abnormalities) syndrome is caused by gain-of-function mutations of maternally expressed gene CDKN1C on chromosome 11p15.5. However, there is no other report describing clinical findings in patients with molecularly studied IMAGe syndrome. Here, we report clinical and molecular findings in Japanese patients. PATIENTS We studied a 46,XX patient aged 8\u00b75 years (case 1) and two 46,XY patients aged 16\u00b75 and 15\u00b70 years (cases 2 and 3). RESULTS Clinical studies revealed not only IMAGe syndrome-compatible phenotypes in cases 1-3, but also hitherto undescribed findings including relative macrocephaly and apparently normal pituitary-gonadal endocrine function in cases 1-3, familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD)-like adrenal phenotype and the history of oligohydramnios in case 2, and arachnodactyly in case 3. Sequence analysis of CDKN1C, pyrosequencing-based methylation analysis of KvDMR1 and high-density oligonucleotide array comparative genome hybridization analysis for chromosome 11p15.5 were performed, showing an identical de novo and maternally inherited CDKN1C gain-of-function mutation (p.Asp274Asn) in cases 1 and 2, respectively, and no demonstrable abnormality in case 3. CONCLUSIONS The results of cases 1 and 2 with CDKN1C mutation would argue the following: [1] relative macrocephaly is consistent with maternal expression of CDKN1C in most tissues and biparental expression of CDKN1C in the foetal brain; [2] FGD-like phenotype can result from CDKN1C mutation; and [3] genital abnormalities may primarily be ascribed to placental dysfunction. Furthermore, lack of CDKN1C mutation in case 3 implies genetic heterogeneity in IMAGe syndrome."

We report the postmortem findings of two siblings with gross and microscopic features consistent with IMAGe association (Intrauterine growth retardation, Metaphyseal dysplasia, Adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and Genital anomalies) with an emphasis on the histopathology of the adrenal gland in this rare syndrome. The first sibling was an 8-week old male diagnosed postnatally with primary adrenal insufficiency. There was no deletion of the DAX1 gene by FISH. Examination at autopsy revealed dysmorphic features including frontal bossing, epicanthal folds, flat philtrum, cryptorchidism, penile chordee, overriding fourth toe, and height and weight below 3rd percentile. Grossly, the adrenal glands were not identified; however, microscopic examination of the suprarenal soft tissue revealed a 3 mm focus of disorganized fetal adrenal cortex with distended \"cytomegalic\" cells with abundant pink eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, and cytoplasmic vacuolization. A minute focus of permanent adult cortex was also seen, but no adrenal medulla was identified. An autopsy of the sibling, who died 12 years previously at day 9 of life, revealed dysmorphic facial features with cryptorchidism and a large phallus. The adrenal glands were grossly hypoplastic (11 mm). Histologically, the adrenal glands showed disorganized fetal cortex with cytomegalic cells, a larger amount of permanent adult cortex, and bizarre nuclei with numerous pseudoinclusions. While there is currently limited information regarding the histopathologic adrenal findings in IMAGe association, our small case series suggests overlapping features between X-linked recessive congenital adrenal hypoplasia (cytomegalic cells with lack of permanent adult cortex) and autosomal recessive congenital adrenal hypoplasia (diminished permanent adult cortex without cytomegalic cells)."

Nuclear RNA degradation pathways are highly conserved across eukaryotes and play important roles in RNA quality control. Key substrates for exosomal degradation include aberrant functional RNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). It has recently been reported that the nuclear exosome is inactivated during meiosis in budding yeast through degradation of the subunit Rrp6, leading to the stabilisation of a subset of meiotic unannotated transcripts (MUTs) of unknown function. We have analysed the activity of the nuclear exosome during meiosis by deletion of TRF4, which encodes a key component of the exosome targeting complex TRAMP. We find that TRAMP mutants produce high levels of CUTs during meiosis that are undetectable in wild-type cells, showing that the nuclear exosome remains functional for CUT degradation, and we further report that the meiotic exosome complex contains Rrp6. Indeed Rrp6 over-expression is insufficient to suppress MUT transcripts, showing that the reduced amount of Rrp6 in meiotic cells does not directly cause MUT accumulation. Lack of TRAMP activity stabilises \u223c 1600 CUTs in meiotic cells, which occupy 40% of the binding capacity of the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC). CBC mutants display defects in the formation of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs), and we see similar defects in TRAMP mutants, suggesting that a key function of the nuclear exosome is to prevent saturation of the CBC complex by CUTs.

Here, we show that the prolyl isomerase Ess1 is required for Nrd1-dependent termination of noncoding RNAs. Ess1 binds the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of pol II and is thought to regulate transcription by conformational isomerization of Ser-Pro bonds within the CTD. In ess1 mutants, expression of approximately 10% of the genome was altered, due primarily to defects in termination of snoRNAs, CUTs, stable unannotated transcripts, and uRNAs. Ess1 promoted dephosphorylation of Ser5 (but not Ser2) within the CTD, most likely by the Ssu72 phosphatase.

To determine the role of Rrp6 in NNS termination globally, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on total RNA and perform ChIP-exo analysis of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) localization. Deletion of RRP6 promotes hyper-elongation of multiple NNS-dependent transcripts resulting from both improperly processed 3' RNA ends and faulty transcript termination at specific target genes. The defects in RNAPII termination cause transcriptome-wide changes in mRNA expression through transcription interference and/or antisense repression, similar to previously reported effects of depleting Nrd1 from the nucleus. Elongated transcripts were identified within all classes of known NNS targets with the largest changes in transcription termination occurring at CUTs. Interestingly, the extended transcripts that we have detected in our studies show remarkable similarity to Nrd1-unterminated transcripts at many locations, suggesting that Rrp6 acts with the NNS complex globally to promote transcription termination in addition to 3' end RNA processing and/or degradation at specific targets."

Stable expression of Rrp47 is dependent upon its interaction with the N-terminal domain of Rrp6 (Rrp6NT). To address the function of Rrp47 independently of Rrp6, we developed a DECOID (decreased expression of complexes by overexpression of interacting domains) strategy to resolve the Rrp6/Rrp47 complex in vivo and employed mpp6\u0394 and rex1\u0394 mutants that are synthetic lethal with loss-of-function rrp47 mutants. Strikingly, Rrp47 was able to function in mpp6\u0394 and rex1\u0394 mutants when separated from the catalytic and exosome-binding domains of Rrp6, whereas a truncated Rrp47 protein lacking its C-terminal region caused a block in cell growth. Northern analyses of the conditional mutants revealed a specific block in the 3' maturation of box C/D snoRNAs in the rex1 rrp47 mutant and widespread inhibition of Rrp6-mediated RNA surveillance processes in the mpp6 rrp47 mutant. In contrast, growth analyses and RNA northern blot hybridization analyses showed no effect on the rrp47\u0394 mutant upon overexpression of the Rrp6NT domain. These findings demonstrate that Rrp47 and Rrp6 have resolvable functions in Rrp6-mediated RNA surveillance and processing pathways.

Non-coding transcripts originating from bidirectional promoters have been reported in a wide range of organisms. In yeast, these divergent transcripts can be subdivided into two classes. Some are designated Cryptic Unstable Transcripts (CUTs) because they are terminated by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 pathway and then rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. This is the same processing pathway used by yeast snoRNAs. Whereas CUTs are only easily observed in cells lacking the Rrp6 or Rrp47 subunits of the nuclear exosome, Stable Uncharacterized Transcripts (SUTs) are present even in wild-type cells. Here we show that SUTs are partially susceptible to the nuclear exosome, but are primarily degraded by cytoplasmic 5' to 3' degradation and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Therefore, SUTs may be processed similarly to mRNAs. Surprisingly, both CUTs and SUTs were found to produce 3' extended species that were also subject to cytoplasmic degradation.

Here we report the first high-resolution genomic map of CUTs in yeast, revealing a class of potentially functional CUTs and the intrinsic bidirectional nature of eukaryotic promoters. An RNA fraction highly enriched in CUTs was analysed by a 3' Long-SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) approach adapted to deep sequencing. The resulting detailed genomic map of CUTs revealed that they derive from extremely widespread and very well defined transcription units and do not result from unspecific transcriptional noise. Moreover, the transcription of CUTs predominantly arises within nucleosome-free regions, most of which correspond to promoter regions of bona fide genes. Some of the CUTs start upstream from messenger RNAs and overlap their 5' end. Our study of glycolysis genes, as well as recent results from the literature, indicate that such concurrent transcription is potentially associated with regulatory mechanisms. Our data reveal numerous new CUTs with such a potential regulatory role. However, most of the identified CUTs corresponded to transcripts divergent from the promoter regions of genes, indicating that they represent by-products of divergent transcription occurring at many and possibly most promoters. Eukaryotic promoter regions are thus intrinsically bidirectional, a fundamental property that escaped previous analyses because in most cases divergent transcription generates short-lived unstable transcripts present at very low steady-state levels."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, non-coding RNAs, including cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), are subject to degradation by the exosome. The Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation (TRAMP) complex in S. cerevisiae is a nuclear exosome cofactor that recruits the exosome to degrade RNAs. Trf4/5 are poly(A) polymerases, Mtr4 is an RNA helicase, and Air1/2 are putative RNA-binding proteins that contain five CCHC zinc knuckles (ZnKs). One central question is how the TRAMP complex, especially the Air1/2 protein, recognizes its RNA substrates. To characterize the function of the Air1/2 protein, we used random mutagenesis of the AIR1/2 gene to identify residues critical for Air protein function. We identified air1-C178R and air2-C167R alleles encoding air1/2 mutant proteins with a substitution in the second cysteine of ZnK5. Mutagenesis of the second cysteine in AIR1/2 ZnK1-5 reveals that Air1/2 ZnK4 and -5 are critical for Air protein function in vivo. In addition, we find that the level of CUT, NEL025c, in air1 ZnK1-5 mutants is stabilized, particularly in air1 ZnK4, suggesting a role for Air1 ZnK4 in the degradation of CUTs. We also find that Air1/2 ZnK4 and -5 are critical for Trf4 interaction and that the Air1-Trf4 interaction and Air1 level are critical for TRAMP complex integrity. We identify a conserved IWRXY motif in the Air1 ZnK4-5 linker that is important for Trf4 interaction. We also find that hZCCHC7, a putative human orthologue of Air1 that contains the IWRXY motif, localizes to the nucleolus in human cells and interacts with both mammalian Trf4 orthologues, PAPD5 and PAPD7 (PAP-associated domain containing 5 and 7), suggesting that hZCCHC7 is the Air component of a human TRAMP complex."

Backmasking is a recording technique used to hide a sound or message in a music track in reverse, meaning that it is only audible when the record is played backwards. Analogously, the compact yeast genome encodes for diverse sources of information such as overlapping coding and non-coding transcripts, and protein-binding sites on the two complementary DNA strands. Examples are the consensus binding site sequences of the RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 that target non-coding transcripts for degradation. Here, by examining the overlap of stable (SUTs, stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable (CUTs, cryptic unstable transcripts) transcripts with protein-coding genes, we show that the predicted Nrd1 and Nab3-binding site sequences occur at differing frequencies. They are always depleted in the sense direction of protein-coding genes, thus avoiding degradation of the transcript. However in the antisense direction, predicted binding sites occur at high frequencies in genes with overlapping unstable ncRNAs (CUTs), so limiting the availability of non-functional transcripts. In contrast they are depleted in genes with overlapping stable ncRNAs (SUTs), presumably to avoid degrading the non-coding transcript. The protein-coding genes maintain similar amino-acid contents, but they display distinct codon usages so that Nrd1 and Nab3-binding sites can arise at differing frequencies in antisense depending on the overlapping transcript type. Our study demonstrates how yeast has evolved to encode multiple layers of information-protein-coding genes in one strand and the relative chance of degrading antisense RNA in the other strand-in the same regions of a compact genome."

Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. Moreover, the rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing.

Aberrant transcriptional activity of WT1 is a key finding in the genesis of Wilms tumors (WTs). However, the mechanisms responsible for this alteration remain poorly understood. In the present study, we examined the methylation pattern of a putative CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding site downstream of the WT1 gene as a potential cause of WT1 misregulation in 44 native WT specimens.

However, there was no correlation between the KTS+/KTS- splicing variants of WT1 and the methylation status of the CpGs of the CTCF binding site. Our results demonstrated an aberrant methylation pattern at a CTCF binding site downstream the WT1 gene, which is associated with an elevated WT1 transcriptional activity.

Transcriptional control of DNA viruses by host cell factors is important in the temporal and spatial regulation of virus gene expression. Many of these factors are recruited to enhance virus gene expression and thereby increase virus production, but host cell factors can also restrict virus gene expression and productivity of infection. CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) is a host cell DNA binding protein important for the regulation of genomic chromatin boundaries, transcriptional control and enhancer element usage. CTCF also functions in RNA polymerase II regulation and in doing so can influence co-transcriptional splicing events. Several DNA viruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) utilize CTCF to control virus gene expression and many studies have highlighted a role for CTCF in the persistence of these diverse oncogenic viruses. CTCF can both enhance and repress virus gene expression and in some cases CTCF increases the complexity of alternatively spliced transcripts. This review article will discuss the function of CTCF in the life cycle of DNA viruses in the context of known host cell CTCF functions."

A typical host has between 10(4) and 10(5) clones of HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes, each clone distinguished by the genomic integration site of the single-copy HTLV-1 provirus. The HTLV-1 bZIP (HBZ) factor gene is constitutively expressed from the minus strand of the provirus, whereas plus-strand expression, required for viral propagation to uninfected cells, is suppressed or intermittent in vivo, allowing escape from host immune surveillance. It remains unknown what regulates this pattern of proviral transcription and latency.

CTCF is a zinc-finger protein that binds to an insulator region in genomic DNA and plays a fundamental role in controlling higher order chromatin structure and gene expression in vertebrate cells. We show that CTCF bound to HTLV-1 acts as an enhancer blocker, regulates HTLV-1 mRNA splicing, and forms long-distance interactions with flanking host chromatin.

BACKGROUND Alternative splicing is primarily controlled by the activity of splicing factors and by the elongation of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Recent experiments have suggested a new complex network of splicing regulation involving chromatin, transcription and multiple protein factors. In particular, the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), the Argonaute protein AGO1, and members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family have been implicated in the regulation of splicing associated with chromatin and the elongation of RNAPII. These results raise the question of whether these proteins may associate at the chromatin level to modulate alternative splicing. RESULTS Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data for CTCF, AGO1, HP1\u03b1, H3K27me3, H3K9me2, H3K36me3, RNAPII, total H3 and 5metC and alternative splicing arrays from two cell lines, we have analyzed the combinatorial code of their binding to chromatin in relation to the alternative splicing patterns between two cell lines, MCF7 and MCF10. Using Machine Learning techniques, we identified the changes in chromatin signals that are most significantly associated with splicing regulation between these two cell lines. Moreover, we have built a map of the chromatin signals on the pre-mRNA, that is, a chromatin-based RNA-map, which can explain 606 (68.55%) of the regulated events between MCF7 and MCF10. This chromatin code involves the presence of HP1\u03b1, CTCF, AGO1, RNAPII and histone marks around regulated exons and can differentiate patterns of skipping and inclusion. Additionally, we found a significant association of HP1\u03b1 and CTCF activities around the regulated exons and a putative DNA binding site for HP1\u03b1. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that a considerable number of alternative splicing events could have a chromatin-dependent regulation involving the association of HP1\u03b1 and CTCF near regulated exons. Additionally, we find further evidence for the involvement of HP1\u03b1 and AGO1 in chromatin-related splicing regulation."

Widely separated sites on DNA, occupied by both CTCF and the cohesin complex, make physical contacts that create large loop domains. Additional contacts between loci within those domains, often also mediated by CTCF, tend to be favored over contacts between loci in different domains. A large number of studies during the past 2 years have addressed the questions: How are these loops generated? What are the effects of disrupting them? Are there rules governing large-scale genome organization? It now appears that the strongest and evolutionarily most conserved of these CTCF interactions have specific rules for the orientation of the paired CTCF sites, implying the existence of a nonequilibrium mechanism of generation. Recent experiments that invert, delete, or inactivate one of a mating CTCF pair result in major changes in patterns of organization and gene expression in the surrounding regions. What remain to be determined are the detailed molecular mechanisms for re-establishing loop domains and maintaining them after replication and mitosis. As recently published data show, some mechanisms may involve interactions with noncoding RNAs as well as protein cofactors. Many CTCF sites are also involved in other functions such as modulation of RNA splicing and specific regulation of gene expression, and the relationship between these activities and loop formation is another unanswered question that should keep investigators occupied for some time."

However, the mechanisms governing dynamic DNA methylation at CTCF-binding sites were unclear. Here, we reveal the methylcytosine dioxygenases TET1 and TET2 as active regulators of CTCF-mediated alternative splicing through conversion of 5-methylcytosine to its oxidation derivatives. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine are enriched at an intragenic CTCF-binding sites in the CD45 model gene and are associated with alternative exon inclusion. Reduced TET levels culminate in increased 5-methylcytosine, resulting in CTCF eviction and exon exclusion. In vitro analyses establish the oxidation derivatives are not sufficient to stimulate splicing, but efficiently promote CTCF association. We further show genomewide that reciprocal exchange of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine at downstream CTCF-binding sites is a general feature of alternative splicing in na\u00efve and activated CD4(+) T cells.

PURPOSES The aim of this article is to carry out an international literature review regarding Kummell's disease, addressing its physiopathology, histopathology, clinical presentation, radiological characteristics and treatment modalities; at the same time, the literature is updated through the description of a new and interesting case, symbol of the pathology long-term potential complications, if not diagnosed and therefore not suitably treated. CASE REPORT A patient with osteoporosis, following a slight spinal trauma, suffered a progressive necrosis of the D11 body; although the radiological exams showed a constant worsening of the thoracic-lumbar kyphosis and a restriction of the spinal canal, in another medical centre he was only treated with a corset and painkillers. A year after the injury, motor deficits concerning the lower limbs appeared. He was then sent to us and indication for posterior internal fixation was given. On the basis of both his medical history and radiological and histological findings, Kummell's disease was diagnosed. CONCLUSION It is necessary to have a complete knowledge of the clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics of Kummell's disease, so as to follow a correct diagnostic course enabling to prepare the most suitable therapy."

Kummell's disease is a rare spinal disorder characterized as avascular necrosis of a vertebral body occurring in a delayed fashion after minor trauma. The disease derives its name from the German surgeon Hermann Kummell, who described a series of patients with the disorder in 1895. Kummell's disease is distinguished from typical osteoporotic compression fractures, by virtue of the fact that patients with Kummell's disease develop symptoms in delayed fashion. In addition, Kummell's disease exhibits different signal characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging when compared to osteoporotic compression fractures. In this review we discuss the pathophysiology, histopathology and treatment of this interesting disorder."

Kummell's disease, caused by osteonecrosis of the vertebral body, is a cause of vertebral collapse. In Kummell's disease, intravertebral instability from nonunion between the cement and bone after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) can cause persistent severe pain and dysfunction. A 75-year-old woman presented with severe pain in the lower back, both buttocks, groin, and both posterior thighs for a period of 30 days. Lumbar radiographs and magnetic resonance images showed an acute compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebra with an intravertebral cleft filled with fluid. The patient underwent PVP for the L1 compression fracture; however, this failed to provide sufficient pain relief. The patient was re-evaluated with dynamic radiography, and intravertebral instability and bone cement displacement of the L1 vertebra were detected. Repeat PVP was performed. After the procedure, intravertebral instability was restored and her pain completely subsided. PVP is a good treatment choice for symptomatic Kummell's disease. However, there is no consensus on the best technique of injecting bone cement to achieve optimal results. It is important to inject more bone cement than the volume of the intravertebral cleft to prevent instability caused by nonunion in PVP for Kummell's disease. We report a case of failed PVP because of insufficient correction of intravertebral instability in Kummell's, along with a review of the literature."

Recent evidence indicates that circRNAs play important roles in tissue development, gene regulation, and carcinogenesis. However, whether circRNAs encode functional proteins remains elusive, although translation of several circRNAs was recently reported. Methods CircRNA deep sequencing was performed by using 10 pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma samples and their paired adjacent normal brain tissues. Northern blotting, Sanger sequencing, antibody, and liquid chromatograph Tandem Mass Spectrometer were used to confirm the existence of circ-FBXW7 and its encoded protein in in two cell lines. Lentivirus-transfected stable U251 and U373 cells were used to assess the biological functions of the novel protein invitro and invivo (five mice per group). Clinical implications of circ-FBXW7 were assessed in 38 pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma samples and their paired periphery normal brain tissues by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (two-sided log-rank test). Results Circ-FBXW7 is abundantly expressed in the normal human brain (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads [RPKM] = 9.31). The spanning junction open reading frame in circ-FBXW7 driven by internal ribosome entry site encodes a novel 21-kDa protein, which we termed FBXW7-185aa. Upregulation of FBXW7-185aa in cancer cells inhibited proliferation and cell cycle acceleration, while knockdown of FBXW7-185aa promoted malignant phenotypes invitro and invivo. FBXW7-185aa reduced the half-life of c-Myc by antagonizing USP28-induced c-Myc stabilization. Moreover, circ-FBXW7 and FBXW7-185aa levels were reduced in glioblastoma clinical samples compared with their paired tumor-adjacent tissues (P < .001). Circ-FBXW7 expression positively associated with glioblastoma patient overall survival (P = .03). Conclusions Endogenous circRNA encodes a functional protein in human cells, and circ-FBXW7 and FBXW7-185aa have potential prognostic implications in brain cancer."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of non-coding RNA that assumes a covalently closed continuous conformation.

Recent studies have revealed that circRNAs are stable and widely expressed, and often exhibit cell type-specific or tissue-specific expression. Most circRNAs can be generated from exons, introns, or both. Remarkably, emerging evidence indicates that some circRNAs can serve as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulate transcription or splicing, and can interact with RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Moreover, circRNAs have been reported to play essential roles in myriad life processes, such as aging, insulin secretion, tissue development, atherosclerotic vascular disease risk, cardiac hypertrophy and cancer. Although circRNAs are ancient molecules, they represent a newly appreciated form of noncoding RNA and as such have great potential implications in clinical and research fields.

SUMMARY Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of transcriptome and proteome.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large type of noncoding RNAs characterized by their circular shape resulting from covalently closed continuous loops. They are known to regulate gene expression in mammals. These tissue-specific transcripts are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences of their host genes. Although several models of circRNA biogenesis have been proposed, the understanding of their origin is far from complete. Unlike other noncoding RNAs, circRNAs are widely expressed, highly conserved and stable in cytoplasm, which confer special functionalities to them. They are known to serve as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors and encode for proteins. The expression of circRNAs is associated with several pathological states and may potentially serve as novel diagnostic or predictive biomarkers. CircRNAs are known to regulate the expression of numerous cancer-related miRNAs. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis is a known regulatory pattern of several cancer-associated pathways, with both agonist and antagonist effects on carcinogenesis. In consideration of their potential clinical relevance, circRNAs are at the center of ongoing research initiatives on cancer prevention and treatment.

INTRODUCTION Fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant disease associated with mutations in the fibrinogen A alpha chain (FGA) gene, and it is the most common cause of hereditary renal amyloidosis in the UK. Patients typically present with kidney impairment and progress to end-stage renal disease over a median time of 4.6 years. METHODS Six patients presented with proteinuria, hypertension, and/or lower limb edema and underwent detailed clinical and laboratory investigations. RESULTS A novel FGA gene mutation was identified in each case: 2 frameshift mutations F521Sfs*27 and G519Efs*30 and 4 single base substitutions G555F, E526K, E524K, R554H. In 5 subjects, extensive amyloid deposits were found solely within the glomeruli, which stained specifically with antibodies to fibrinogen A alpha chain, and in one of these cases, we found coexistent fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease. One patient was diagnosed with light-chain amyloidosis after a bone marrow examination revealed a small clonal plasma cell population, and laser microdissection of the amyloid deposits followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry identified kappa light chain as the fibril protein. DISCUSSION We report 6 novel mutations in the FGA gene: 5 were associated with renal fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis and 1 was found to be incidental to light-chain amyloid deposits discovered in a patient with a plasma cell dyscrasia. Clinical awareness and suspicion of hereditary amyloidosis corroborated by genetic analysis and adequate typing using combined immunohistochemistry and laser microdissection and mass spectrometry is valuable to avoid misdiagnosis, especially when a family history of amyloidosis is absent."

Mutations in the fibrinogen A alpha-chain gene are the most common cause of hereditary renal amyloidosis in the United Kingdom. Previous reports of fibrinogen A alpha-chain amyloidosis have been in isolated kindreds, usually in the context of a novel amyloidogenic mutation. Here, we describe 71 patients with fibrinogen amyloidosis, who were prospectively studied at the UK National Amyloidosis Centre. Median age at presentation was 58 yr, and renal involvement led to diagnosis in all cases. Even after a median follow-up of 4 yr, clinically significant extra-renal disease was rare. Renal histology was characteristic: striking glomerular enlargement with almost complete obliteration of the normal architecture by amyloid deposition and little or no vascular or interstitial amyloid. We discovered four amyloidogenic mutations in fibrinogen (P552H, E540V, T538K, and T525fs). A family history of renal disease was frequently absent. Median time from presentation to ESRD was 4.6 yr, and the estimated median patient survival from presentation was 15.2 yr. Among 44 patients who reached ESRD, median survival was 9.3 yr. Twelve renal transplants survived for a median of 6.0 (0-12.2) yr. Seven grafts had failed after median follow up from transplantation of 5.8 yr, including three from recurrent amyloid after 5.8, 6.0, and 7.4 yr; three grafts failed immediately for surgical reasons and one failed from transplant glomerulopathy after 5.8 yr with no histological evidence of amyloid. At censor, the longest surviving graft was 12.2 yr. In summary, fibrinogen amyloidosis is predominantly a renal disease characterized by variable penetrance, distinctive histological appearance, proteinuria, and progressive renal impairment. Survival is markedly better than observed with systemic AL amyloidosis, and outcomes with renal replacement therapy are comparable to those for age-matched individuals with nondiabetic renal disease."

A French kindred with autosomal dominant hereditary renal amyloidosis was found to have a novel mutation in the fibrinogen Aalpha-chain gene. In this kindred, renal disease appeared early in life and led to terminal renal failure at an early age. Renal transplantation resulted in rapid destruction of the allograft by amyloid deposition within 2 years. Amyloid fibril protein isolated from a transplanted kidney was found to contain a novel, hybrid peptide of 49 residues whose N-terminal 23 amino acids were identical to residues 499 to 521 of normal fibrinogen Aalpha-chain. The remainder of the peptide (26 residues) represented a completely new sequence for mammalian proteins. DNA sequencing documented that the new sequence was the result of a single nucleotide deletion at position 4897 of the fibrinogen Aalpha-chain gene that gives a frame-shift at codon 522 and premature termination at codon 548. The contributions toward fibrillogenesis of the two portions of the amyloid fibril protein, ie, N-terminal fibrinogen sequence and C-terminal novel sequence, are presently unknown. However, the early onset and rapid reoccurrence of amyloid in renal transplants is unlike the clinical course with other amyloid proteins having single amino acid substitutions that give hereditary renal amyloidosis.

BACKGROUND Hereditary amyloidosis with predominant renal disease can be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the fibrinogen A\u03b1-chain (AFib). Here, we describe the clinical course of AFib amyloidosis associated with the rare R554L mutation, and the significance of extrarenal amyloid deposits and their possible influence on cardiovascular morbidity. METHODS We report on 101 members of a family after having conducted patient interviews, chart review, genetic testing, renal biopsies and assessment for extrarenal amyloid deposition. RESULTS Ten family members had chronic kidney disease with late-onset gross proteinuria and a variable course of declining renal function, starting in the fourth decade of life. In two affected living members, we identified the AFib R554L mutation. Renal biopsies from two affected members revealed almost complete obliteration of the mesangial glomerular architecture, although kidney function was only moderately impaired. There was neither evidence of extrarenal amyloidosis nor accelerated atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS Renal amyloidosis associated with the R554L AFib variant dominated the clinical picture in this family, which was similar to that associated with the much more prevalent E526V mutation. Although it has been hypothesized that vascular deposits of fibrinogen amyloid may be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, there was no suggestion of this in this particular kindred."

Two families with hereditary renal amyloidosis were found to have a novel mutation in the fibrinogen A alpha chain gene. This form of amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by proteinuria, hypertension, and subsequent azotemia. DNAs of patients with amyloidosis were screened for a polymorphism in fibrinogen A alpha chain gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and affected individuals from two kindreds were found to have a mutation. Both of these kindreds are American of Irish descent presenting with non-neuropathic, nephropathic amyloidosis in the fifth to the seventh decade of life. DNA sequencing showed a point mutation in the fibrinogen A alpha chain gene that is responsible for substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 526. By restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, 7 affected individuals and 14 asymptomatic individuals in these two kindreds were positive for the fibrinogen A alpha chain Val 526 gene. Fibrinogen was isolated from plasma of a heterozygous gene carrier and shown to contain approximately 50% variant fibrinogen. Discovery of this new mutation confirms the association between fibrinogen A alpha chain variant and hereditary renal amyloidosis and establishes a new biochemical subtype of amyloidosis."

PATIENTS AND METHODS We implemented a search strategy to identify studies in the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, CBM, Wanfang, and VIP, and assessed the quality of extracted data from the trials included. Statistical software was used to perform network meta-analysis. RESULTS The use of novel therapeutic agents in combination with the Stupp protocol were all shown to be superior than the Stupp protocol alone for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma, ranked as follows: cilengitide 2000mg/5/week, bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan, nimotuzumab, bevacizumab, cilengitide 2000mg/2/week, cytokine-induced killer cell immunotherapy, and the Stupp protocol.

The most common adverse events were thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, nausea, and vomiting, none of which were significantly different between the groups except for neutropenia, pneumonia, and embolism. CONCLUSIONS All intervention drugs evaluated in our study were superior to the Stupp protocol alone when used in combination with it.

The integrin antagonist cilengitide has been explored as an adjunct with anti-angiogenic properties to standard of care temozolomide chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT \u2192 TMZ) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Preclinical data as well as anecdotal clinical observations indicate that anti-angiogenic treatment may result in altered patterns of tumor progression. Using a standardized approach, we analyzed patterns of progression on MRI in 21 patients enrolled onto a phase 2 trial of cilengitide added to TMZ/RT \u2192 TMZ in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Thirty patients from the experimental treatment arm of the EORTC/NCIC pivotal TMZ trial served as a reference. MRIcro software was used to map location and extent of initial preoperative and recurrent tumors on MRI of both groups into the same stereotaxic space which were then analyzed using an automated tool of image analysis. Clinical and outcome data of the cilengitide-treated patients were similar to those of the EORTC/NCIC trial except for a higher proportion of patients with a methylated O(6)-methylguanyl-DNA-methyltransferase gene promoter. Analysis of recurrence pattern revealed neither a difference in the size of the recurrent tumor nor in the distance of the recurrences from the preoperative tumor location between groups. Overall frequencies of distant recurrences were 20 % in the reference group and 19 % (4/21 patients) in the cilengitide group. Compared with TMZ/RT \u2192 TMZ alone, the addition of cilengitide does not alter patterns of progression. This analysis does not support concerns that integrin antagonism by cilengitide may induce a more aggressive phenotype at progression, but also provides no evidence for an anti-invasive activity of cilengitide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma."

BACKGROUND Cilengitide is a selective \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin inhibitor. Data from phase 2 trials suggest that it has antitumour activity as a single agent in recurrent glioblastoma and in combination with standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (particularly in tumours with methylated MGMT promoter). We aimed to assess cilengitide combined with temozolomide chemoradiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with methylated MGMT promoter. METHODS In this multicentre, open-label, phase 3 study, we investigated the efficacy of cilengitide in patients from 146 study sites in 25 countries. Eligible patients (newly diagnosed, histologically proven supratentorial glioblastoma, methylated MGMT promoter, and age \u226518 years) were stratified for prognostic Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class and geographic region and centrally randomised in a 1:1 ratio with interactive voice response system to receive temozolomide chemoradiotherapy with cilengitide 2000 mg intravenously twice weekly (cilengitide group) or temozolomide chemoradiotherapy alone (control group). Patients and investigators were unmasked to treatment allocation. Maintenance temozolomide was given for up to six cycles, and cilengitide was given for up to 18 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary endpoint was overall survival. We analysed survival outcomes by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00689221. FINDINGS Overall, 3471 patients were screened. Of these patients, 3060 had tumour MGMT status tested; 926 patients had a methylated MGMT promoter, and 545 were randomly assigned to the cilengitide (n=272) or control groups (n=273) between Oct 31, 2008, and May 12, 2011. Median overall survival was 26\u00b73 months (95% CI 23\u00b78-28\u00b78) in the cilengitide group and 26\u00b73 months (23\u00b79-34\u00b77) in the control group (hazard ratio 1\u00b702, 95% CI 0\u00b781-1\u00b729, p=0\u00b786). None of the predefined clinical subgroups showed a benefit from cilengitide. We noted no overall additional toxic effects with cilengitide treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events of grade 3 or worse in the safety population were lymphopenia (31 [12%] in the cilengitide group vs 26 [10%] in the control group), thrombocytopenia (28 [11%] vs 46 [18%]), neutropenia (19 [7%] vs 24 [9%]), leucopenia (18 [7%] vs 20 [8%]), and convulsion (14 [5%] vs 15 [6%]). INTERPRETATION The addition of cilengitide to temozolomide chemoradiotherapy did not improve outcomes; cilengitide will not be further developed as an anticancer drug. Nevertheless, integrins remain a potential treatment target for glioblastoma. FUNDING Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany."

Malignant gliomas especially glioblastoma (GBM) are poorly responsive to the current treatments. Cilengitide (CGT) is a cyclic pentapeptide that demonstrated efficacy for GBM treatment by targeting the integrins av\u03b23 and av\u03b25 over-expressed on GBM cells. However, clinical translation of this therapy has been limited by issues including fast blood clearance, high kidney and liver uptake, poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, low tumor specificity and rapid washout from tumors. In this study, these issues were tackled in an integrated manner using a multi-stage strategy combining ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) with CGT nanotherapy. CGT nanoparticles (CGT-NP) prepared using gelatin and Poloxamer 188-grafted heparin copolymer demonstrated significant apoptotic and cytotoxic effects in C6 GBM cells. Biodistribution study in a rat GBM model demonstrated buildup of high CGT level in tumors subjected to CGT-NP+UTMD combined therapy. The tumor CGT level in these animals was increased over 3-fold, tumor retention of CGT prolonged and renal clearance significantly reduced when compared with free CGT with or without UTMD. CGT-NP+UTMD treatment was further shown to extend the median survival period from less than 20days in the control and about 30days in free CGT group to about 80days. This was achieved with low CGT dosing level (2mg/kg twice weekly). In situ monitoring of GFAP, Ki67, caspase-3, Beclin-1, and LC-3 in the tumor samples together with TUNEL assay, transmission electron microscope imaging and Western blot assay all demonstrated high apoptotic and autophagy activities induced by the combined therapy. In conclusion, this study has provided extensive preclinical data supporting the use of this combined therapy to overcome the limitations of standard CGT treatment of gliomas."

BACKGROUND Determining the expression levels of neuroglial antigen 2 (NG2) in glioma cell lines and to evaluate the potential contribution of NG2 to cilengitide response were aimed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Endogenous expression level of NG2 was determined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Cilengitide responses of the cells were monitored to determine half maximal inhibitory concentration values. Whether the suppression of NG2 expression alters the response of A172 cells to cilengitide was examined. RESULTS The effect of cilengitide on inducing apoptosis of the cells was determined by TUNEL staining. High mRNA and protein expression of NG2 was detected in A172 and U-87MG cells, while T98G, M059K and M059J cells demonstrated low levels of NG2. A172, U-87MG and positive control MG-63 were relatively sensitive to cilengitide compared to T98G, M059K and M059J. MG-63, A172 and U-87MG were unexpectedly found to be more susceptible to cilengitide. In addition, NG2 knock-down showed no significant difference in cell death between small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected and cilengitide-treated groups. The results showed that cilengitide caused detachment and subsequently initiated apoptosis. Glioma cell lines express variable levels of NG2 and differ in their responses to cilengitide. Although increased numbers of apoptotic cells were found in untransfected cells compared to siRNA-transfected cells upon exposed to cilengitide, the difference was not documented to be significant between two groups. CONCLUSION It may be proposed that the combination therapy of NG2 suppression and cilengitide treatment showed no considerable effect on glioblastoma compared to cilengitide therapy alone. Response to therapy may be further improved by targeting other factors act in concert in this signaling pathway."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal brain tumors with a short survival time. EGFR amplification and mutation is the most significant genetic signature in GBM. About half of the GBMs with EGFR amplification express a constitutively autophosphorylated variant of EGFR, known as EGFRvIII. Our in vitro data demonstrated further enhanced EGFRvIII activity and tumor cell invasion in the tumor microenvironment of hypoxia plus extracellular matrix (ECM) vitronectin, in which EGFRvIII and integrin \u03b23 tended to form complexes.

Different subgroups may represent different pathogenic and aetiological factors. Thus, subcategorization provides further understanding of the basis of King-Kopetzky syndrome, and hence may guide the rehabilitative management of these patients."

The present study explored illness perceptions of hearing difficulties amongst one hundred participants who reported experiencing hearing difficulties despite normal audiometric thresholds.

Logistic regression was used to consider the associations between help-seeking and a range of audiological and illness perception measures. Results indicate that help-seekers present with poorer speech in noise thresholds than non help-seekers, and that coherent illness perceptions and a negative belief in the consequences of hearing difficulties are associated with help-seeking status, regardless of hearing sensitivity."

While recent research has focussed on the possible mechanistic basis for these difficulties, the perceptions of the hearing difficulties that lead people to seek help have not hitherto been identified. This study presents findings from an observational survey of causal attributions of hearing difficulties from 100 people with KKS. The findings suggest that participants regard immunity and risk related causes of hearing difficulties as pre-dominant. Psychological factors were not considered to be causal for hearing difficulties. These factors were not affected by diagnostic classification. These findings inform audiologists about their patient beliefs for the first time. The authors suggest that clinicians take care to ensure that their counselling is responsive to these beliefs."

A dominant genetic aetiology has been found in a proportion of cases. It may be associated with minor peripheral or central auditory dysfunction, and frequently the individuals exhibit anxious or depressive personalities. We found no relationship with noise exposure in a series of patients compared with matched controls.

The significantly higher (worse) SHHI scores in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome indicate that this group suffer a considerable degree of speech-hearing disability. In our study, the main findings are that some psychological factors, performance of the sentence in noise test and auditory thresholds are significantly correlated with the SHHI scores. We were unable to find any relationships between the SHHI and frequency resolution or EOAEs. In a multiple stepwise regression, somatic anxiety and the performance of the sentence in noise test are the significant predictors of SHHI scores.

This unique mechanism, independent of insulin secretion and beta cell function, has made this class of medication desirable in patients with type 2 diabetes. However in May 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning pertaining to the development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors. DKA associated with SGLT2 inhibitors frequently develops in the absence of hyperglycemia, which makes the diagnosis more challenging. Due to the reversible inhibition of SGLT2 by this class of medication, a quick recovery of glucosuria after cessation of medication is expected. In this article, we present a case of a 50-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes who developed euglycemic DKA after initiating therapy with canagliflozin. This case of DKA associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use was unique due to her hypoglycemic presentation and persistent glucosuria.

Sodium-glucose linked transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a relatively new class of antidiabetic drugs with positive cardiovascular and kidney effects. The aim of this review is to present the safety issues associated with SGLT2 inhibitors. Urogenital infections are the most frequently encountered adverse events, although tend to be mild to moderate and are easily manageable with standard treatment. Although no increased acute kidney injury risk was evident in the major trials, the mechanism of action of these drugs requires caution when they are administered in patients with extracellular volume depletion or with drugs affecting renal hemodynamics. Canagliflozin raised the risk of amputations and the rate of fractures in the CANVAS trial, although more data are necessary before drawing definite conclusions. The risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis seems to be minimal when the drugs are prescribed properly. Regarding other adverse events, SGLT2 inhibitors do not increase the risk of hypoglycemia even when co-administered with insulin, but a decrease in the dose of sulphonylureas may be needed. The available data do not point to a causative role of SGLT2 inhibitors on malignancy risk, however, these drugs should be used with caution in patients with known hematuria or history of bladder cancer.

In May of 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released a warning concerning a potential increased risk of ketoacidosis and ketosis in patients taking these medications. CASE REPORT We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking a combination of canagliflozin and metformin who presented with progressive altered mental status over the previous 2 days. Her work-up demonstrated a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 38 and a venous serum pH of 7.08. The serum glucose was 168 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed glucose > 500 mg/dL and ketones of 80 mg/dL. Further evaluation demonstrated an elevated serum osmolality of 319 mOsm/kg and an acetone concentration of 93 mg/dL. She was treated with intravenous insulin and fluids, and the metabolic abnormalities and her altered mental status resolved within 36 h. This was the first episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for this patient. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitor medications are at risk for ketoacidosis. Due to the renal glucose-wasting properties of these drugs, they may present with ketoacidosis with only mild elevations in serum glucose, potentially complicating the diagnosis. Acetone is one of the three main ketone bodies formed during DKA and it may be present at considerable concentrations, contributing to the serum osmolality."

Ipilimumab was also approved by FDA in the adjuvant setting for patients with high risk, stage III melanoma. The anti-PD1 directed antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab are superior to single agent ipilimumab, which is no longer considered the standard first line treatment in metastatic melanoma. The addition ipilimumab to nivolumab is associated with a higher response rate and a better PFS, particularly in patients with PD-L1 negative tumors, albeit at the cost of a steep increase in grade 3-4 adverse event rate.

Drug resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy is limiting the therapeutic efficacy of most anticancer drugs and represents a major obstacle in medical oncology. However, treatment of various human malignancies with biologics, mostly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), is not limited by such chemoresistance mechanisms. However, other resistance or evasion mechanisms limit the efficacy to anticancer therapeutic mAbs that engage tumor-associated antigens on the surface of the malignant cells. Immune checkpoint blocking monoclonal antibodies are heralded as a promising therapeutic approach in clinical oncology. These mAbs do not directly attack the malignant cells as most anticancer mAbs; rather, they enhance the anti-tumor response of the immune system by targeting immune regulatory pathways. Three mAbs targeting immune checkpoint molecules are currently used in the clinic and new mAbs that target other potential inhibitory targets are being actively investigated. This therapeutic approach, while proving as highly beneficial for many patients, is prone to toxicities and side effects of an autoimmune nature. Defining suitable management algorithms and biomarkers that predict therapeutic effects and adverse toxicity are required to provide survival benefit for larger numbers of cancer patients. Overcoming these challenges, along with opportunities for new agents and combinatorial strategies are the main focus of immune checkpoint blockade research today."

The immune system plays an active role in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer (OC), as well as in the mechanisms of disease progression and overall survival (OS). Immunotherapy in gynecological cancers could help to revert immunosuppression and lymphocyte depletion due to prior treatments. Current immunotherapies for ovarian cancer, like all cancer immunotherapy, are based on either stimulating the immune system or reverting immune suppression. Several approaches have been used, including therapeutic vaccines, monoclonal antibodies; checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T cell transfer. Most of these therapies are still in early-phase testing (phase I and II) for ovarian cancer, but the initial data in ovarian cancer and successful use in other types of cancers suggests some of these approaches may ultimately prove useful for ovarian cancer as well. Ovarian cancer vaccines have shown only a modest benefit in ovarian cancer when used as monotherapy, but these agents may be able to enhance antitumor activity when combined with chemotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors, or other immunotherapies. Monoclonal antibodies have been explored in ovarian cancer but despite encouraging phase II data, randomized studies failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefit. Check point inhibitors have promising activity in several solid tumors and have demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile. Data from early clinical trials utilizing PD1 and PD-L1 inhibitors showed encouraging results. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the role of check point inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy. Adoptive T cell transfer involves the infusion of ex vivo activated and expanded tumor specific T cells, using various sources and types of T cells. While this approach has been explored in several hematologic malignancies, it constitutes early research in ovarian cancer. Immunotherapy remains investigational in ovarian cancer and the benefit of this approach in improving progression-free survival (PFS) or OS is unknown. Previous clinical trials have not selected patients based on biomarkers and this may explain the negative results. We expect to discover that tumor response will relate to the patient's immune features and specific tumor characteristics. We are only beginning to realize the potential of immunotherapy for ovarian cancer patients, and one goal of future clinical trials will be to identify subsets of patient based on histologic, molecular, and immune characteristics."

BACKGROUND Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent brain tumor. Despite recent advances in treatment approaches the prognosis remains poor, with a median overall survival of 14.6 months. Immunotherapy is the subject of ongoing research and its benefit is becoming evident in other malignancies. Immune check-points such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death receptor (PD-1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) reduce immune response. OBJECTIVE To clarify the role of immune check point inhibitors in GBM management. METHODS Preclinical and clinical trials of immune check-point inhibitors in GBM were obtained by searching for English peer-reviewed articles on PubMed databases, trials registered on clincaltrials. gov and abstracts recently presented at international congresses. RESULTS Immune check point inhibitors may be of critical importance for the design of future immunotherapy approaches in GBM management. CONCLUSION Immune check-point inhibitors should be considered a promising treatment option in GBM."

Several cancers are highly refractory to conventional chemotherapy. The survival of tumors in several cases is assisted by checkpoint immunomodulation to maintain the imbalance between immune surveillance and cancer cell proliferation. Check point antibody inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1, are a novel class of inhibitors that function as a tumor suppressing factor via modulation of immune cell-tumor cell interaction. These checkpoint blockers are rapidly becoming a highly promising cancer therapeutic approach that yields remarkable antitumor responses with limited side effects. In recent times, more than four check point antibody inhibitors have been commercialized for targeting PD-1, PDL-1, and CTLA-4. Despite the huge success and efficacy of the anti-PD therapy response, it is limited to specific types of cancers, which attributes to the insufficient and heterogeneous expression of PD-1 in the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we review the current landscape of the PD-1/PD-L1 mechanistic role in tumor immune evasion and therapeutic outcome for cancer treatment. We also review the current progress in clinical trials, combination of drug therapy with immunotherapy, safety, and future of check point inhibitors for multiple types of cancer."

Till now, the prognosis of advanced gastric cancer looked dreadful; thus the search for newer better approaches for this lethal disease has been a strategic target for cancer researchers. In recent years, important immunobiological aspects of the tumor have been revealed with the subsequent proposal of immune check point inhibitors to target these pathways. Clinically, unselected use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in gastric cancer has been deemed with failure; in contrast to the clear success of more recent studies reporting on the use of pembrolizumab in molecularly selected patients. This may illustrate that any future use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in gastric cancer has to be molecularly supported.

Immune check-point inhibitors are now employed as single-agents in current practice for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while combinations of different inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials. Although the safety profile of these compounds, with particular reference to drugs targeting programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), is generally considered manageable, peculiar, immune-related toxicities may onset. Areas covered: This review focuses on the immune-related adverse events (irAEs) observed during immune check-point blockade in NSCLC and their management. The authors report the incidence of irAEs based on the currently available data involving NSCLC and provide recommendations on the general approach to irAEs, as well as indications for the most relevant site-specific events. Expert opinion: Since irAEs may involve a wide range of organs and systems and are potentially reversible if promptly treated, early diagnosis should always be achieved; this might be particularly challenging when other potential causes of toxicity are suspected, such as infections or concurrent treatments. Finally, drugs active on the PD-1/PD-L1 axis appear to be generally manageable even when they are administered to patients with relevant comorbidities, provided that adequate clinical monitoring is performed."

The isolate IG 3 was able to grow in presence of NaCl ranging from 0 to 20% in Luria Bertani medium. The present study was planned to evaluate the role of inoculation of PGPR strain IG 3 and its efficacy in augmenting salt tolerance in oat (Avena sativa) under NaCl stress (100mM). The physiological parameter such as shoot length, root length, shoot dry weight, root dry weight and relative water content (RWC) were remarkably higher in IG 3 inoculated plants in comparison to un-inoculated plants under NaCl stress. Similarly, the biochemical parameters such as proline content, electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and activities of antioxidant enzymes were analyzed and found to be notably lesser in IG 3 inoculated oat plants in contrast to un-inoculated plants under salt stress. Inoculation of IG 3 strain to oat seedlings under salt stress positively modulated the expression profile of rbcL and WRKY1 genes. Root colonization of root surface and interior was demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy and tetrazolium staining, respectively. Due these outcomes, it could be implicated that inoculation of PGPR strain IG 3 enhanced plant growth under salt stress condition. This study demonstrates that PGPR play an imperative function in stimulating salt tolerance in plants and can be used as biofertilizer to enhance growth of crops in saline areas."

Intergenomic translocations between A/D and C-genome chromosomes were frequently observed in hexaploid and tetraploid species. In the hexaploid, two pairs of A/D genome segments on C-genome chromosome (A/D-C) translocation and four to six pairs of C-genome segments on A/D genome chromosome (C-A/D) translocation were clearly identified whilst the number of A/D-C translocations was constant among species. In the tetraploid A. maroccana (AACC), a pair of A-C and four pairs of C-A translocations were observed. Moreover, the A/D translocation segments on chromosome 5C was detected only in A. byzantina and A. maroccana, whilst A/D-C translocations were observed on the 1C and 7C of A. sativa, A. fatua and A. sterilis. A. byzantina did however also carry the 1C rearrangement. This result shows that A. byzantina has retained a similar genomic constitution to the tetraploid ancestor of hexaploid oats, A. maroccana.

PCR primers designed from the wheat Lrk10 were used to produce ALrk10 from oat. Two DNA sequences, ALrk1A1 and ALrk4A5, were produced from primers designed from coding and noncoding regions of ALrk10. Their use as RFLP probes indicated that the kinase genes mapped to four loci on different hexaploid oat 'Kanota' x 'Ogle' linkage groups (4_12, 5, 6, and 13) and to a fifth locus unlinked to other markers. Three of these linkage groups contain a region homologous to the short arm of chromosome I of wheat and the fourth contains a region homologous to chromosome 3 of wheat. Analysis with several nullisomics of oat indicated that two of the map locations are on satellite chromosomes. RFLP mapping in a 'Dumont' x 'OT328' population indicated that one map location is closely linked to Pg9, a resistance gene to oat stem rust (Puccinia graminis subsp. avenae).

Gravitropism of oat (Avena sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) coleoptiles was investigated in relation to the displacement angle or to the initially set stimulation angle (SA). We measured curvature rates at the early phase of curvature, before it was affected by the drop in SA resulting from the curvature response itself. The plot of the rates against the sines of initial SAs revealed similar curves for oats and wheat, which approached saturation as the sine increased to unity. The two species and previously analyzed rice [Iino et al. (1996) Plant Cell Environ. 19: 1160] appeared to have similar gravisensitivities. Initial SAs below and over 90 degrees yielded comparable rates when the sine values were the same, indicating that the extent of gravitropism is determined by the gravity component perpendicular to the organ's long axis. Long-term curvature kinetics at different SAs indicated that the net curvature rate dropped sharply before the tip reached the vertical position and then the tip approached the vertical slowly, with clear oscillatory movements in the case of wheat. During this late curvature phase, the coleoptile straightened gradually, although none of its parts had yet reached the vertical. When rotated on horizontal clinostats or displaced upwards to reduce SA in the late curvature phase, coleoptiles bent in the opposite direction. These results demonstrated that autotropism counteracts gravitropism to straighten coleoptiles."

Methods This double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced cross-over study assessed the effects of single doses of the green-oat extract (GOE) across a broad range of cognitive domains in healthy adults aged 40-65 years who self-reported that they felt that their memory had declined with age. Participants attended on six occasions, receiving a single dose of either placebo, 800, or 1600 mg GOE on each occasion, with the counterbalanced order of treatments repeated twice for each participant. Cognitive function was assessed with a range of computerized tasks measuring attention, spatial/working/episodic memory, and executive function pre-dose and at 1, 2.5, 4, and 6 hours post-dose. Results The results showed that 800mg GOE increased the speed of performance across post-dose assessments on a global measure including data from all of the timed tasks. It also improved performance of a delayed word recall task in terms of errors and an executive function task (Peg and Ball) in terms of decreased thinking time and overall completion time. Working memory span (Corsi blocks) was also increased, but only on the second occasion that this dose was taken. Discussion These results confirm the acute cognitive effects of GOE seen in previous research, and suggest that the optimal dose lies at or below 800 mg."

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with multiple probes was used to analyze mitotic and meiotic chromosome spreads of Avena sativa cv 'Sun II' monosomic lines, and of A. byzantina cv 'Kanota' monosomic lines from spontaneous haploids. The probes used were A. strigosa pAs120a (a repetitive sequence abundant in A-genome chromatin), A. murphyi pAm1 (a repetitive sequence abundant in C-genome chromatin), A. strigosa pITS (internal transcribed spacer of rDNA) and the wheat rDNA probes pTa71 (nucleolus organizer region or NOR) and pTa794 (5S). Simultaneous and sequential FISH employing pairs of these probes allowed the identification and genome assignation of all chromosomes. FISH mapping using mitotic and meiotic metaphases facilitated the genomic and chromosomal identification of the monosome in each line. Of the 17 'Sun II' lines analyzed, 13 distinct monosomic lines were found, corresponding to four monosomes of the A-genome, five of the C-genome and four of the D-genome. In addition, 12 distinct monosomic lines were detected among the 20 'Kanota' lines examined, corresponding to six monosomes of the A-genome, three of the C-genome and three of the D-genome. The results show that 19 chromosomes out of 21 of the complement are represented by monosomes between the two genetic backgrounds. The identity of the remaining chromosomes can be deduced either from one intergenomic translocation detected on both 'Sun II' and 'Kanota' lines, or from the single reciprocal, intergenomic translocation detected among the 'Sun II' lines. These results permit a new system to be proposed for numbering the 21 chromosome pairs of the hexaploid oat complement. Accordingly, the A-genome contains chromosomes 8A, 11A, 13A, 15A, 16A, 17A and 19A; the C-genome contains chromosomes 1C, 2C, 3C, 4C, 5C, 6C and 7C; and the D-genome consists of chromosomes 9D, 10D, 12D, 14D, 18D, 20D and 21D. Moreover, the FISH patterns of 16 chromosomes in 'Sun II' and 15 in 'Kanota' suggest that these chromosomes could be involved in intergenomic translocations. By comparing the identities of individually translocated chromosomes in the two hexaploid species with those of other hexaploids, we detected different types of intergenomic translocations."

The tests assessed were probe-to-bone (PTB), clinical signs of infection, radiography signs of osteomyelitis, and ulcer specimen culture. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A prospective study was performed on patients with foot ulcers referred to our diabetic foot clinic. Ulcer infection was diagnosed by recording clinical signs of infection and taking specimens for culture. The presumptive diagnosis of osteomyelitis was based on these results and the findings of a plain X-ray and PTB test. All patients with a clinical suspicion of bone infection were subjected to surgical treatment of the affected bone. During surgery, bone specimens were obtained for a histological diagnosis of osteomyelitis. RESULTS Over 2.5 years, 210 foot lesions were consecutively examined and 132 of these wounds with clinical suspicion of infection selected as the study sample. Of these, 105 (79.5%) lesions were diagnosed as osteomyelitis. Among the tests compared, the best results were yielded by the PTB test including an efficiency of 94%, sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 78%, positive predictive value of 95%, and negative predictive value of 91% (P < 0.001, \u03ba 0.803); the positive likelihood ratio was 4.41, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.02 (95% CI).

We conclude that the PTB test can accurately rule in diabetic foot OM in the high-risk patients and rule out OM in low-risk patients."

OBJECTIVE We sought to assess the accuracy of the probe-to-bone (PTB) test in diagnosing foot osteomyelitis in a cohort of diabetic patients with bone culture proven disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this 2-year longitudinal cohort study, we enrolled 1,666 consecutive diabetic individuals who underwent an initial standardized detailed foot assessment, followed by examinations at regular intervals. Patients were instructed to immediately come to the foot clinic if they developed a lower-extremity complication. For all patients with a lower-extremity wound, we compared the results of the PTB test with those of a culture of the affected bone. We called PTB positive if the bone or joint was palpable and defined osteomyelitis as a positive bone culture. RESULTS Over a mean of 27.2 months of follow-up, 247 patients developed a foot wound and 151 developed 199 foot infections. Osteomyelitis was found in 30 patients: 12% of those with a foot wound and 20% in those with a foot infection. When all wounds were considered, the PTB test was highly sensitive (0.87) and specific (0.91); the positive predictive value was only 0.57, but the negative predictive value was 0.98. CONCLUSIONS The PTB test, when used in a population of diabetic patients with a foot wound among whom the prevalence of osteomyelitis was 12%, had a relatively low positive predictive value, but a negative test may exclude the diagnosis."

BACKGROUND Diabetes mellitus continues to grow in global prevalence and to consume an increasing amount of health care resources. One of the key areas of morbidity associated with diabetes is the diabetic foot. To improve the care of patients with diabetic foot and to provide an evidence-based multidisciplinary management approach, the Society for Vascular Surgery in collaboration with the American Podiatric Medical Association and the Society for Vascular Medicine developed this clinical practice guideline. METHODS The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. This was based on five systematic reviews of the literature. Specific areas of focus included (1) prevention of diabetic foot ulceration, (2) off-loading, (3) diagnosis of osteomyelitis, (4) wound care, and (5) peripheral arterial disease. RESULTS Although we identified only limited high-quality evidence for many of the critical questions, we used the best available evidence and considered the patients' values and preferences and the clinical context to develop these guidelines. We include preventive recommendations such as those for adequate glycemic control, periodic foot inspection, and patient and family education. We recommend using custom therapeutic footwear in high-risk diabetic patients, including those with significant neuropathy, foot deformities, or previous amputation. In patients with plantar diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), we recommend off-loading with a total contact cast or irremovable fixed ankle walking boot. In patients with a new DFU, we recommend probe to bone test and plain films to be followed by magnetic resonance imaging if a soft tissue abscess or osteomyelitis is suspected. We provide recommendations on comprehensive wound care and various d\u00e9bridement methods. For DFUs that fail to improve (>50% wound area reduction) after a minimum of 4 weeks of standard wound therapy, we recommend adjunctive wound therapy options. In patients with DFU who have peripheral arterial disease, we recommend revascularization by either surgical bypass or endovascular therapy. CONCLUSIONS Whereas these guidelines have addressed five key areas in the care of DFUs, they do not cover all the aspects of this complex condition. Going forward as future evidence accumulates, we plan to update our recommendations accordingly."

CONTEXT Osteomyelitis of the lower extremity is a commonly encountered problem in patients with diabetes and is an important cause of amputation and admission to the hospital. The diagnosis of lower limb osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes remains a challenge. OBJECTIVE To determine the accuracy of historical features, physical examination, and laboratory and basic radiographic testing. We searched for systematic reviews of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of lower extremity osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes to compare its performance with the reference standard. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE search of English-language articles published between 1966 and March 2007 related to osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes. Additional articles were identified through a hand search of references from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and polling experts. STUDY SELECTION Original studies were selected if they (1) described historical features, physical examination, laboratory investigations, or plain radiograph in the diagnosis of lower extremity osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes mellitus, (2) data could be extracted to construct 2 x 2 tables or had reported operating characteristics of the diagnostic measure, and (3) the diagnostic test was compared with a reference standard. Of 279 articles retrieved, 21 form the basis of this review. Data from a single high-quality meta-analysis were used to summarize the diagnostic characteristics of MRI in osteomyelitis. DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently assigned each study a quality grade using previously published criteria and abstracted operating characteristic data using a standardized instrument. DATA SYNTHESIS The gold standard for diagnosis is bone biopsy. No studies were identified that addressed the utility of the history in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. An ulcer area larger than 2 cm2 (positive likelihood ratio [LR], 7.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-49; negative LR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.76) and a positive \"probe-to-bone\" test result (summary positive LR, 6.4; 95% CI, 3.6-11; negative LR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.76) were the best clinical findings. A erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 70 mm/h increases the probability of a diagnosis of osteomyelitis (summary LR, 11; 95% CI, 1.6-79). An abnormal plain radiograph doubles the odds of osteomyelitis (summary LR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.6-3.3). A positive MRI result increases the likelihood of osteomyelitis (summary LR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.5-5.8). However, a normal MRI result makes osteomyelitis much less likely (summary LR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.26). The overall accuracy (ie, the weighted average of the sensitivity and specificity) of the MRI is 89% (95% CI, 83.0%-94.5%). CONCLUSIONS An ulcer area larger than 2 cm2, a positive probe-to-bone test result, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 70 mm/h, and an abnormal plain radiograph result are helpful in diagnosing the presence of lower extremity osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes. A negative MRI result makes the diagnosis much less likely when all of these findings are absent. No single historical feature or physical examination reliably excludes osteomyelitis. The diagnostic utility of a combination of findings is unknown."

AIMS To investigate the accuracy of the sequential combination of the probe-to-bone test and plain X-rays for diagnosing osteomyelitis in the foot of patients with diabetes. METHODS We prospectively compiled data on a series of 338 patients with diabetes with 356 episodes of foot infection who were hospitalized in the Diabetic Foot Unit of La Paloma Hospital from 1 October 2002 to 31 April 2010. For each patient we did a probe-to-bone test at the time of the initial evaluation and then obtained plain X-rays of the involved foot. All patients with positive results on either the probe-to-bone test or plain X-ray underwent an appropriate surgical procedure, which included obtaining a bone specimen that was processed for histology and culture. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios of the procedures, using the histopathological diagnosis of osteomyelitis as the criterion standard. RESULTS Overall, 72.4% of patients had histologically proven osteomyelitis, 85.2% of whom had positive bone culture. The performance characteristics of both the probe-to-bone test and plain X-rays were excellent. The sequential diagnostic approach had a sensitivity of 0.97, specificity of 0.92, positive predictive value of 0.97, negative predictive value of 0.93, positive likelihood ratio of 12.8 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.02. Only 6.6% of patients with negative results on both diagnostic studies had osteomyelitis. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians seeing patients in a setting similar to ours (specialized diabetic foot unit with a high prevalence of osteomyelitis) can confidently diagnose diabetic foot osteomyelitis when either the probe-to-bone test or a plain X-ray, or especially both, are positive."

BACKGROUND We investigated the validity of probe-to-bone testing in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis in a selected subgroup of patients clinically suspected of having diabetic foot osteomyelitis. METHODS Between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2008, inpatients and outpatients with a diabetic foot ulcer were prospectively evaluated, and those having a clinical diagnosis of foot infection and at least one of the osteomyelitis clinical suspicion criteria were consecutively included in this study. RESULTS Sixty-five patients met the inclusion criteria and were prospectively enrolled in the study. Forty-nine patients (75.4%) were hospitalized, and the remaining 16 (24.6%) were followed as outpatients. Osteomyelitis was diagnosed in 39 patients (60.0%). Probe-to-bone test results were positive in 30 patients (46.1%). The positive predictive value for the probe-to-bone test was fairly high (87%), but the negative predictive value was only 62%. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 66% and 84%, respectively. White blood cell counts and mean C-reactive protein levels did not statistically significantly differ between groups. However, erythrocyte sedimentation rates greater than 70 mm/h reached statistical significance between groups. Wound area and depth were not found to be statistically significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS Positive probe-to-bone test results and erythrocyte sedimentation rates greater than 70 mm/h provide some support for the diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis, but it is not strong; magnetic resonance imaging or bone biopsy will probably be required in cases of doubt."

If drug-induced, it can be an isolated phenomenon, but it may also accompany or follow a cutaneous phototoxicity reaction due to drug intake and exposure to ultraviolet irradiation. Photo-onycholysis is a rare photosensitivity reaction due to exposure to either a natural or artificial source of light. Many drugs are responsible for this phototoxic reaction, especially tetracyclines, psoralens, chloramphenicol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fluoroquinolones, and, rarely, doxycycline. Any patient given enough of a therapeutic dose of an inducing drug and sufficient light irradiation can develop phototoxic reactions. While there is no need to avoid these drugs completely, precautions should be taken. Here we have reported the case of a patient who developed onycholysis of his fingernails with sparing of the toenails following administration of diclofenac therapy for lower back pain. The onycholysis was associated with a phototoxic reaction. The swellings resolved totally within two days, and the patient started to notice the separation of all fingernail plates from their nail beds. The patient was treated symptomatically.

Approximately 13 million individuals in the United Sates suffer from rosacea, a recurrent disease that may require long-term therapy. Topical and oral antibiotics have been used to treat rosacea; however, high-dose antibiotics or long-term, low-dose antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of rosacea flares or for rosacea maintenance therapy, respectively, can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms. The first oral medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of rosacea in the United States is Oracea (CollaGenex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Newtown, PA, USA). Oracea is a 40 mg capsule of doxycycline monohydrate, containing 30 mg immediate-release and 10 mg delayed-release doxycycline beads (\"anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline\"). Anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline is not an antibiotic and does not lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Each capsule of anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline contains a total of 40 mg of anhydrous doxycycline as 30 mg of immediate-release and 10 mg of delayed-release beads. In contrast to other oral therapies, anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline is taken once daily, which may increase treatment compliance. The results of two phase III trials have been encouraging, leading to the recent release (summer 2006) of Oracea for the treatment of rosacea in the United States. Anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines or increased photosensitivity, or by pregnant or nursing women (anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline is a pregnancy category-D medication). The risk of permanent teeth discoloration and decreased bone growth rate make anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline contraindicated in infants and children. However, when used appropriately in patients with rosacea, anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline may help prolong the effectiveness and life span of our most precious antibiotics."

Chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) is an uncommon, eczematous photosensitive eruption affecting predominantly elderly men and to which drug-induced photosensitivity may sometimes appear clinically identical. This retrospective study compares the monochromatic irradiation results in 11 patients with CAD and 14 patients with drug-induced photosensitivity, to assess whether such testing is useful in the differentiation of these two conditions. Thus, the action spectra of the drug photosensitivity patients were plotted and compared with those of 12 nonphotosensitive control patients: 10 patients were found to be photosensitive in the UVA range; the implicated drugs included quinine, sparfloxacin, amiodarone, doxycycline, mefenamic acid, nalidixic acid, fenbrufen, diclofenac, enalapril, diltiazem and prochlorperazine maleate. One patient on doxycycline was photosensitive in both the UVA and UVB ranges. The remaining three patients were not tested until after discontinuation of their drug and their light tests were then normal. In the CAD group, five patients were photosensitive in the UVA, UVB and visible light ranges and six were photosensitive in the UVA and UVB ranges. Comparison of the mean minimal erythema dose responses then demonstrated dissociation of the drug-induced from the CAD group in the UVB region; the result was statistically significant. This suggests that UVA-sensitivity dissociated from UVB-sensitivity is a relative indicator of drug-induced photosensitivity and monochromatic irradiation testing may therefore be helpful in the differentiation of these two disorders."

BACKGROUND One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity. As doxycycline is important for malaria prophylaxis and malaria is mainly spread in countries with high sun radiation, special attention should be paid to this adverse effect. While there are many publications on the phototoxicity of tetracyclines in general, only a few exist focusing on doxycycline. The objective of this systematic review was to summarize all available reports on clinical manifestations, influencing factors like UV dose or dose of medication, and the possibilities of prevention by sun protection. METHODS This review is based on a systematic search in PubMed for articles in English and German and a manual search between 1990 and 2015. RESULTS The number of publications is low. Clinical symptoms vary from light sunburn-like sensation (burning, erythema) to large-area photodermatitis. Also, onycholysis is possible. The triggering UV spectrum seems to consist mainly of UVA1 (340-400 nm), so UV-protective products should be used that cover this range. Travelers to tropical countries taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis need thorough medical counseling to avoid possibly severe phototoxic reactions. CONCLUSION Evidence base must be improved for giving advice on appropriate prevention measures to travelers taking doxycycline and having a risk of significant sun exposure."

BACKGROUND Mefloquine is one of four antimalarial agents commonly recommended for preventing malaria in travellers to malaria-endemic areas. Despite its high efficacy, there is controversy about its psychological side effects. OBJECTIVES To summarize the efficacy and safety of mefloquine used as prophylaxis for malaria in travellers. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE (https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/toxline.htm); and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home) for trials in progress, using 'mefloquine', 'Lariam', and 'malaria' as search terms. The search date was 22 June 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (for efficacy and safety) and non-randomized cohort studies (for safety). We compared prophylactic mefloquine with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative recommended antimalarial agent. Our study populations included all adults and children, including pregnant women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials, extracted and analysed data. We compared dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prespecified adverse outcomes are included in 'Summary of findings' tables, with the best available estimate of the absolute frequency of each outcome in short-term international travellers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included 20 RCTs (11,470 participants); 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants); and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants). Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self-reported or clinician-assessed symptoms, rather than formal medical diagnoses. Mefloquine efficacyOf 12 trials comparing mefloquine and placebo, none were performed in short-term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and 0% to 13% in the mefloquine group (median 1%).In four RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline in non-immune, short-term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (4 trials, 1822 participants). Mefloquine safety versus atovaquone-proguanil Participants receiving mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than atovaquone-proguanil users (RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.31; 3 RCTs, 1438 participants; high-certainty evidence). There were few serious adverse effects reported with mefloquine (15/2651 travellers) and none with atovaquone-proguanil (940 travellers).One RCT and six cohort studies reported on our prespecified adverse effects. In the RCT with short-term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.04, moderate-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.42, 95% CI 2.56 to 7.64, moderate-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 6.12, 95% CI 1.82 to 20.66, moderate-certainty evidence), and depressed mood during travel (RR 5.78, 95% CI 1.71 to 19.61, moderate-certainty evidence). The cohort studies in longer-term travellers were consistent with this finding but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (high-certainty evidence) and dizziness (high-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect sizes for mefloquine versus atovaquone-proguanil are 6% versus 2% for discontinuation of the drug, 13% versus 3% for insomnia, 14% versus 7% for abnormal dreams, 6% versus 1% for anxiety, and 6% versus 1% for depressed mood. Mefloquine safety versus doxycyclineNo difference was found in numbers of serious adverse effects with mefloquine and doxycycline (low-certainty evidence) or numbers of discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.87; 4 RCTs, 763 participants; low-certainty evidence).Six cohort studies in longer-term occupational travellers reported our prespecified adverse effects; one RCT in military personnel and one cohort study in short-term travellers reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 10.49, 95% CI 3.79 to 29.10; 4 cohort studies, 2588 participants, very low-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.19 to 14.44; 4 cohort studies, 3212 participants, very low-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 18.04, 95% CI 9.32 to 34.93; 3 cohort studies, 2559 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and depressed mood (RR 11.43, 95% CI 5.21 to 25.07; 2 cohort studies, 2445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short-term international travellers were consistent with this finding but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in frequencies of abnormal dreams or insomnia.Mefloquine users were less likely to report dyspepsia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 5 cohort studies, 5104 participants, low certainty-evidence), photosensitivity (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11; 2 cohort studies, 1875 participants, very low-certainty evidence), vomiting (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; 4 cohort studies, 5071 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and vaginal thrush (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 1 cohort study, 1761 participants, very low-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush.Additional analyses, including comparisons of mefloquine with chloroquine, added no new information. Subgroup analysis by study design, duration of travel, and military versus non-military participants, provided no conclusive findings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The absolute risk of malaria during short-term travel appears low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone-proguanil).The choice of antimalarial agent depends on how individual travellers assess the importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden, and cost. Some travellers will prefer mefloquine for its once-weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood."

BACKGROUND Therapeutic guidelines for treatment of late manifestations of Lyme borreliosis have not yet become well established. Patients with symptoms suggesting central nervous system involvement are often treated with courses of intravenous ceftriaxone. This is an expensive treatment approach with potentially severe side effects. We compared the efficacy, side effects and costs of doxycycline and ceftriaxone in the treatment of such patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Adult patients qualified for the study if they had nonspecific symptoms suggesting central nervous system involvement for more than six months (but without overt clinical signs of the involvement), had positive serum borrelial antibody titers and/or erythema migrans prior to the onset of symptoms, had not been previously treated with antibiotics and did not have pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. Patients were given either 100 mg of oral doxycycline twice daily for 4 weeks (23 patients) or 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone daily for 2 weeks followed by 100 mg of doxycycline twice daily for another 2 weeks (23 patients). Clinical outcome was assessed during a 12-month follow-up period. RESULTS Improvement in the frequency and/or the intensity of symptoms was reported by more than two-thirds of the 46 patients enrolled in the study. The two treatment regimens were found to be correspondingly effective. Photosensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were noted more often among patients receiving doxycycline than in those receiving ceftriaxone. Treatment with doxycycline proved to be much cheaper than with ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS In patients with previously untreated chronic Lyme borreliosis with symptoms suggesting central nervous system involvement but without overt clinical signs of it, and without pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, treatment with doxycycline is as effective as with ceftriaxone. Treatment with doxycycline is cheap and relatively safe, but gastrointestinal symptoms and photosensitivity reactions can be expected more often than with ceftriaxone."

BACKGROUND It has been hypothesized that certain Mycoplasma species may cause Gulf War veterans' illnesses (GWVIs), chronic diseases characterized by pain, fatigue, and cognitive symptoms, and that affected patients may benefit from doxycycline treatment. OBJECTIVE To determine whether a 12-month course of doxycycline improves functional status in Gulf War veterans with GWVIs. DESIGN A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 12 months of treatment and 6 additional months of follow-up. SETTING 26 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and 2 U.S. Department of Defense medical centers. PARTICIPANTS 491 deployed Gulf War veterans with GWVIs and detectable Mycoplasma DNA in the blood. INTERVENTION Doxycycline, 200 mg, or matching placebo daily for 12 months. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who improved more than 7 units on the Physical Component Summary score of the Veterans Short Form-36 General Health Survey 12 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes were measures of pain, fatigue, and cognitive function and change in positivity for Mycoplasma species at 6, 12, and 18 months after randomization. RESULTS No statistically significant differences were found between the doxycycline and placebo groups for the primary outcome measure (43 of 238 participants [18.1%] vs. 42 of 243 participants [17.3%]; difference, 0.8 percentage point [95% CI, -6.5 to 8.0 percentage points]; P > 0.2) or for secondary outcome measures at 1 year. In addition, possible differences in outcomes at 3 and 6 months were not apparent at 9 or 18 months. Participants in the doxycycline group had a higher incidence of nausea and photosensitivity. LIMITATIONS Adherence to treatment after 6 months was poor. CONCLUSION Long-term treatment with doxycycline did not improve outcomes of GWVIs at 1 year."

BACKGROUND Data regarding the treatment of nonsexually acquired genital ulceration (NSAGU) are limited. OBJECTIVE We sought to provide evidence for the safety and efficacy of topical and systemic corticosteroids followed by doxycycline prophylaxis for acute and recurrent NSAGU. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with NSAGU treated in a private dermogynecology practice. RESULTS A total of 26 girls and women with NSAGU were identified and divided into 2 groups: group A = 17 patients with moderate to severe ulceration treated in the acute stage with oral corticosteroid; and group B = 9 patients with mild ulceration treated in the acute stage with topical corticosteroid. Patients in group A, with a mean age of 27.9 years (range, 11-62 years), were treated with oral prednisolone commencing with 15 to 50 mg per day depending on severity. Sixteen (94%) achieved rapid pain relief and complete healing of ulcers within 16 days. Eight (47%) commenced doxycycline prophylaxis. Women in group B, with a mean age of 42.5 years (range, 26-67 years) were treated with topical corticosteroids. Eight (89%) had a history of recurrent ulcers and 6 (66%) commenced doxycycline prophylaxis. Of all 14 patients on doxycycline prophylaxis, none reported any recurrences during a mean follow-up of 18.3 months. There were no adverse effects caused by prednisolone. One patient experienced mild photosensitivity from doxycycline but continued to take it. LIMITATIONS This was a retrospective case series from a single private practice-based population. CONCLUSION Topical or oral corticosteroids followed by prophylactic doxycycline can be effective in rapidly resolving acute flareups and preventing recurrences of NSAGU. All patients responded to therapy without treatment-limiting side effects."

OBJECTIVES Many patients undergoing long-term doxycycline treatment do not regularly take their treatment because of photosensitivity. Our objective was to create an assay for determining doxycycline levels and to use hair samples for monitoring the compliance over a longer period of time. METHODS We tested sera and hair samples from patients treated with doxycycline by a suitable ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) based assay. RESULTS We estimated that the speed of hair growth is roughly 1.25 cm per month and we were able to determine doxycycline levels over a 6-month period. We tested 14 patients treated with doxycycline and we found similar levels of doxycycline in the serum and the hair samples representing the last 4 months. Linear regression analysis revealed that the level of doxycycline in the serum remained stable over time (p = 0.7) but the level of doxycycline in the hair decreased significantly over time (p = 0.03) indicating a degradation of this molecule in the hair. We detected two patients who did not have antibiotic in the hair, indicating a lack of compliance that was also confirmed by interview.

Doxycycline is a commonly used tetracycline antibiotic showing the broad spectrum of antibacterial action.

One of the factors influencing the photosensitivity reactions is the melanin content in melanocytes. In this study, the impact of doxycycline and UVA irradiation on cell viability, melanogenesis and antioxidant defense system in cultured normal human epidermal melanocytes (HEMn-DP) was examined. The exposure of cells to doxycycline and UVA radiation resulted in concentration-dependent loss in melanocytes viability and induced melanin biosynthesis. Significant changes were stated in cellular antioxidant enzymes activity: SOD, CAT and GPx, which indicates alterations of antioxidant defense system.

UNLABELLED INTRODUCTION Doege-Potter syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia secondary to a solitary fibrous tumor. This tumor causes hypoglycemia by the secretion of a prohormone form of insulin-like growth factor II. We describe the diagnosis and management of Doege-Potter syndrome and the use of transarterial chemoembolization in a patient with a malignant extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor. CASE PRESENTATION Our patient was a 64-year-old Caucasian woman who initially presented with urinary incontinence and was found to have a 14.5\u00d79.0\u00d79.0cm retroperitoneal solitary fibrous tumor compressing her bladder. Her tumor was surgically resected but recurred with multiple hepatic metastatic lesions. The hepatic metastases progressed despite systemic chemotherapy and treatment with doxorubicin transarterial chemoembolization. Her course was complicated by the development of recurrent fasting hypoglycemia, most likely secondary to Doege-Potter syndrome. Her hypoglycemia was managed with corticosteroid therapy and frequent scheduled nutrient intake overnight. CONCLUSIONS The rarity of hepatic solitary fibrous tumors and consequent lack of controlled trials make this report significant in that it describes the diagnostic approach to Doege-Potter syndrome, describes our experience with the use of doxorubicin transarterial chemoembolization, and presents management options for tumor-associated hypoglycemia in the case of extensive disease not amenable to surgical resection."

AIM Doege-Potter syndrome is a rare condition consisting of a mesenchymal tumor, either benign or malignant, accompanied by severe hypoglycemia. The syndrome was first described independently by two American physicians, Karl Walter Doege (1867-1932) and Roy Pilling Potter (1879-1968), in 1930, but it was not before 1988 that it was associated with non-islet cell tumor production of insulin growth factor (IGF) that induces hypoglycemia as a paraneoplastic syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION We present the case of a 61-year-old woman with severe hypoglycemia that induced seizures. On the general check-up, a massive tumor occupying the lower part of left hemi-thorax was discovered. Initially, corticosteroids, glucose i.v. and high carbohydrate diet managed to prevent the severe blood glucose drop. Surgery exposed a massive well-defined pleural tumor. After surgical removal, blood glucose stabilized. Histological examination confirmed the fibrous tumor that proved to be malignant on immunochemistry. DISCUSSION The authors discuss other cases reported in the literature of this rare condition and its pathogenic mechanisms, the presented case being the first reported in Romania. CONCLUSIONS The clinician should be aware of the possible existence of a pleural tumor in a patient presenting an unexplained hypoglycemia because the surgical removal of the tumor can solve the clinical manifestations."

BACKGROUND AND AIM Routine screening for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) or portal vein thrombosis (PVT) has been recommended in Western countries. However, little is known about whether the routine screening test should be necessary in Chinese patients with BCS or PVT. We conducted a prospective observational study to examine the prevalence of PNH in these patients. METHODS Patients with primary BCS or non-malignant PVT who were consecutively admitted to our department or regularly followed up between September 2009 and December 2011 were eligible for the study and detected the expression of CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes and granulocytes. The CD55 or CD59 deficiency was considered as the proportion of erythrocytes or granulocytes with normal expression of CD55 or CD59 was less than 90%. PNH was diagnosed by both CD55 and CD59 deficient clone at flow cytometry of peripheral blood cells. RESULTS CD55 and/or CD59 deficiencies were found in 1.6% (2/127) of patients with primary BCS, 1.0% (1/100) of non-malignant and non-cirrhotic patients with PVT, and 4.7% (4/85) of cirrhotic patients with PVT. Only one patient had both CD55 and CD59 deficiencies on granulocytes. But he had been diagnosed with PNH before BCS. CONCLUSIONS Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was very rare in Chinese patients with BCS or PVT, suggesting that routine screening for PNH should not be indiscriminately performed in such patients."

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired disease characterized by a clone of blood cells lacking glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins at the cell membrane. Deficiency of the GPI-anchored complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis upon complement activation. Apart from hemolysis, another prominent feature is a highly increased risk of thrombosis. Thrombosis in PNH results in high morbidity and mortality. Often, thrombosis occurs at unusual locations, with the Budd\u2013Chiari syndrome being the most frequent manifestation. Primary prophylaxis with vitamin K antagonists reduces the risk but does not completely prevent thrombosis. Eculizumab, a mAb against complement factor C5, effectively reduces intravascular hemolysis and also thrombotic risk. Therefore, eculizumab treatment has dramatically improved the prognosis of PNH. The mechanism of thrombosis in PNH is still unknown, but the highly beneficial effect of eculizumab on thrombotic risk suggests a major role for complement activation. Additionally, a deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins involved in hemostasis may be implicated."

Whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify gene variants. We evaluated the function of CD55 in patients' cells, which we confirmed by means of exogenous induction of expression of CD55. RESULTS We identified homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding CD55 (decay-accelerating factor), which lead to loss of protein expression. Patients' T lymphocytes showed increased complement activation causing surface deposition of complement and the generation of soluble C5a. Costimulatory function and cytokine modulation by CD55 were defective. Genetic reconstitution of CD55 or treatment with a complement-inhibitory therapeutic antibody reversed abnormal complement activation.

Flowcytometry with glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored proteins (GPI-AP)-CD55, -CD59, and -CD16 was performed on all patients and controls to assess the prevalence of deficiencies and PNH-type phenotype clone size. Deficiencies of individual GPI-AP were seen in 17.3% cases versus 3.4% controls. This was due to CD55 deficiency on red blood cells and CD16 deficiency on the granulocytes. Deficiency of multiple GPI-APs was less frequent (3.7% cases). Data of this study indicate that the PNH defect as detected with CD55, CD59, and CD16 is not an important cause of intra-abdominal thrombosis in northwestern India."

PURPOSE To report on isolated central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) as an initial presentation in two patients with undiagnosed paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). METHODS CRAO related to the aggravation of PNH was observed in 2 of 98 consecutive PNH patients for 10 years. Ocular and systemic manifestations were evaluated before and after systemic steroid, eculizumab and anticoagulant administration with adjuvant ocular treatments. RESULTS Two young patients presented with complaints of acute painless monocular vision loss. In both cases, fundus examination revealed retinal edema and a cherry-red spot in the macula, consistent with CRAO. On systemic evaluation, severe anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed, and simultaneously thrombogenic processes were suggested by increased D-dimers, fibrinogen degradation products and/or portal vein thrombosis. PNH testing of red blood cells revealed a CD55 and CD59 deficiency consistent with PNH in both cases. The systemic complications typically associated with thrombosis were not observed for the following several months with early conservative treatments including eculizumab. CONCLUSIONS Acute blindness from CRAO can be a unique manifestation of undiagnosed PNH and its subsequent aggravation. Systemic evaluations including PNH testing, especially in young CRAO patients, are strongly recommended for early detection of the further systemic thrombogenic processes."

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hemolytic anemia with highly variable clinical symptoms making the diagnosis and prediction of its outcome difficult. It is caused by the expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor cell that has acquired a mutation in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) gene that results in deficiency of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor structure responsible for fixing a wide spectrum of proteins particularly CD55 and CD59. The clinical features of this disease arise as a result of complement-mediated hemolysis in unprotected red cells, leukocytes, and platelets as well as the release of free hemoglobin. Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as anemia, thrombosis, kidney disease, smooth muscle dystonias, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue. PNH is an outstanding example of how an increased understanding of pathophysiology may directly improve clinical symptoms and treat disease-associated complications when we inhibit the terminal complement cascade. This topic will discuss PNH overview to assist specialists looking after PNH patients."

Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a clonal haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disease that presents with haemolytic anaemia, thrombosis and smooth muscle dystonias, as well as bone marrow failure in some cases. PNH is caused by somatic mutations in PIGA (which encodes phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit A) in one or more HSC clones. The gene product of PIGA is required for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors; thus, PIGA mutations lead to a deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins, such as complement decay-accelerating factor (also known as CD55) and CD59 glycoprotein (CD59), which are both complement inhibitors. Clinical manifestations of PNH occur when a HSC clone carrying somatic PIGA mutations acquires a growth advantage and differentiates, generating mature blood cells that are deficient of GPI-anchored proteins. The loss of CD55 and CD59 renders PNH erythrocytes susceptible to intravascular haemolysis, which can lead to thrombosis and to much of the morbidity and mortality of PNH. The accumulation of anaphylatoxins (such as C5a) from complement activation might also have a role. The natural history of PNH is highly variable, ranging from quiescent to life-threatening. Therapeutic strategies include terminal complement blockade and bone marrow transplantation. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody complement inhibitor, is highly effective and the only licensed therapy for PNH."

This is a chronic, progressive condition usually affecting young male smokers and is characterized by giant emphysematous bullae, which commonly develop in the upper lobes. Extensive paraseptal emphysema coalesces to form giant bullae, compressing the normal lung parenchyma and often displacing it centrally. These bullae occupy at least one-third of a hemithorax. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven patients with chest radiographic evidence of a bulla or bullae occupying at least one-third of a hemithorax, who had also been examined with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), were included in this retrospective study. On HRCT scans, the size, location, and distribution of the bullae were documented and categorized as either subpleural or central. RESULTS The HRCT scan findings in all 7 study patients included numerous bullae ranging in size from a few centimeters in diameter to giant bullae nearly filling an entire hemithorax, mimicking a pneumothorax. Five of the 7 patients had extensive upper lobe predominant bullae, 4 of the 7 patients showed severe bilateral disease with asymmetric involvement, 2 of the 7 patients demonstrated left lung predominance and whereas 1 patient showed right lung predominant disease. All of our patients had subpleural bullae, had parenchymal fibrosis, another had extensive subcutaneous emphysema, and 1 had accompanying bronchiectasis. CONCLUSIONS The predominant findings on HRCT scans are extensive paraseptal emphysema coalescing into giant bullae.

The frequency of HCW tested positive for TB seems not far from other experiences in low incidence countries. Our results confirm the higher specificity of IGRA, but, due to its higher cost, TST can be considered a good first level screening test, whose positive results should be further confirmed by IGRA before the patients undergo X-ray diagnosis and/or chemotherapy."

However active, prompt and accurate diagnosis is the key element in the public health response to tuberculosis and the cornerstone of tuberculosis control. Different diagnostic methods for an assured diagnosis of TB are necessary. Chest radiography is a useful keystone to identify tuberculosis, but diagnosis of tuberculosis cannot be established by radiography alone. CT scanning is used in patients without pathological chest radiography but clinically suspected active TB and to differentiate TB from other diseases. Radiological appearance is primarily determined by the immune status of patients and caverns and disseminated disease foci are often observed. Laboratory diagnostic methods include microscopic identification of acid-fast mycobacteria from any body fluid (especially sputum), as well as isolation and characterisation of mycobacteria in culture. It is then possible to type the pathogens by the shape of their colony, their growth behavior and their biochemical characteristics. These methods are regarded as the gold standard in diagnosis of active TB. In patients who are highly suspected of having TB, but whose sputum specimens tested negative for mycobacteria, a nucleic acid amplification test is additionally performed. Moreover, sensitivity testing with first and second line antitubercular drugs is applied as standard. Laboratory diagnostic testing of cellular immunity against pathogenic mycobacteria employs the tuberculin skin test (TST, Mantoux tuberculin test) or the more specific interferon \u03b3 test to determine \u03b3 interferon released by T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro. The new ELISA and ELISPOT procedures exhibit higher test specificity and less cross reactivity to NTM (non-tuberculosis mycobacteria), are independent of BCG-vaccination status and correlate better with the degree of exposure than does the TST."

Tuberculosis is responsible for more then 2 million deaths worldwide each year and vies with HIV as the world's most fatal infectious disease. In many developing countries, attempts to control the spread of infection rely solely on identification and treatment of those with active disease, ignoring subclinical infection. However, in developed countries, large efforts are also expended to identify and give prophylactic drugs to people with latent tuberculosis infection. Until recently, the 100-year-old tuberculin skin test (Mantoux) has been the only available diagnostic test for latent tuberculosis infection, despite its many well-known limitations. Advances in scientific knowledge have led to the development of tests for tuberculosis that measure the production of interferon-gamma by T-cells stimulated in vitro with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens. These interferon-gamma tests are highly specific and unaffected by prior Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccination or immune reactivity to most atypical mycobacteria. They are more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in detecting people with active tuberculosis, and their results correlate more closely with M. tuberculosis exposure risk factors than the tuberculin skin test in people likely to have latent tuberculosis infection. Science has caught up with one of the oldest diagnostic tests still in use worldwide, and the adoption of new, tuberculosis-specific interferon-gamma-based tests should move us one step closer to better control of this insidious pathogen."

BACKGROUND Minors with a stated age <18 years unaccompanied by a responsible adult form an increasing part of refugees to Europe. They are older than other asylum-seeking children and many come from countries with a high tuberculosis (TB) incidence. During the 2015 refugee crisis, 35,369 of 162,877 refugees (22%) seeking asylum in Sweden were unaccompanied minors, which gave us the opportunity to study their burden of TB infection and disease. METHODS Of the unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Sweden during 2015, 2936 (8.3%) were allocated to northern Stockholm. Of these, 2422 were from countries with an incidence of TB exceeding 100/105, and were screened for TB infection with a Mantoux tuberculin skin test or a QuantiFERON-TB Gold\u00ae. Those from countries with a lower TB incidence were screened only if they had other risk factors for TB exposure. RESULTS Of those screened, 349 had a positive test and were referred to the northern paediatric TB clinic at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital. Of these, 16 had TB disease and 278 latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), while we considered 53 uninfected. In addition, eight sought medical attention with symptomatic TB outside the screening system. Cohort rates were 6.8% of LTBI and 0.5% of TB in minors from Afghanistan and 26-32% of LTBI and 3.4-3.5% of TB among those from Eritrea, Ethiopia or Somalia.

Of 697 tested patients, 252 showed test results consistent with tuberculosis infection (36.2%). 55 of these 697 patients had active tuberculosis disease or a prior history of tuberculosis (7.9%). A positive tuberculin skin test was found in 197 of 642 patients (30.7%) with a diagnosis different from tuberculosis (COPD, pneumonia, cancer and others). In our study, the sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test for active tuberculosis infection was 95%. The present study revealed a high prevalence of tuberculosis infection among hospitalized patients in a pneumological department. Further studies are needed to assess the usefulness of routine tuberculin skin testing in hospitalized populations."

In Russia, an intradermal Diaskintest\u00ae drug has been designed, which is a recombinant tuberculosis allergen based on M. tuberculosis-- specific proteins: ESAT-6 and CFP-10 produced by a genetically modified Escherichia coli culture. Diaskintest\u00ae test and Mantoux test with 2TE PPD-L were concurrently carried out in 300 children and adolescents with tuberculosis and followed up in risk groups at a tuberculosis dispensary to determine the sensitivity of the new skin test in active tuberculosis infection. Diaskintest\u00ae showed a high sensitivity not only in active tuberculosis, but also in occult, the so-called latent, tuberculosis infection. This is suggested by the following evidence. The high percentage (83.8%) of positive responses to Diaskintest\u00ae is noted in children and adolescents with tuberculosis, receiving an intensive course of chemotherapy. Negative tests were observed only in minor forms at the resolution stage. In the children who had completed treatment, positive tests were seen in 78.3%, moreover in those with prior tuberculosis of intrathoracic lymph nodes; negative tests were observed not earlier than 18 months after start of treatment. The highest sensitivity of Diaskintest\u00ae was shown in children with early primary tuberculosis infection and through family contact with bacteria-excreting subjects (91.7%). These children may be judged with the highest assurance to have latent tuberculosis infection, the population of which is in an active state at the moment of the study. The children with early primary tuberculosis infection, but in no family contact with bacteria-excreting individuals, showed a lower percentage of positive responses to Diaskintest\u00ae both before (37.5%) and after (10%) treatment, which suggests that there must be a lower bacterial burden in the child. A high percentage of positive responses to Diaskintest\u00ae (76.2%) were found in subjects with hyperergic reactions to tuberculin. These were in only 16.7% in the group of patients receiving preventive therapy. In children and adolescents with a persistent positive Mantoux test (for more than 3 years), the response to Diaskintest\u00ae was negative in most cases since in early infection when mycobacteria propagated, the reaction to the drug was positive, but as 3 years pass the probability of the infection transition to the persistence stage is high--at that time the response to Diaskintest\u00ae becomes negative. Diaskintest\u00ae induces no delayed hypersensitivity associated with BCG vaccination, suggesting its high specificity. There were no positive reactions in patients with nonspecific lung diseases."

BACKGROUND The nationwide prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in Italian patients with psoriasis has never been investigated. OBJECTIVES To estimate the nationwide prevalence of LTBI in Italian patients with psoriasis who are candidates for systemic treatment. METHODS Data were obtained from the Psocare Registry on those patients (n = 4946) with age > 18 years, systemic treatment at entry specified and tuberculin skin test (TST) performed according to the Mantoux method. LTBI diagnosis was based on a positive TST result in the absence of any clinical, radiological or microbiological evidence of active tuberculosis. RESULTS Latent tuberculosis infection was diagnosed in 8\u00b73% of patients with psoriasis (409 of 4946). The prevalence of LTBI was lower in patients on biologics than in those on conventional systemic treatments, ranging from 4\u00b73% (19 of 444) of patients on adalimumab to 31% (eight of 26) of those on psoralen-ultraviolet A (P < 0\u00b705). Independent factors associated with LTBI were male sex [odds ratio (OR) 1\u00b730, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1\u00b704-1\u00b762; P = 0\u00b702], age over 55 years (OR 2\u00b793, 95% CI 2\u00b718-3\u00b793; P < 0\u00b7001) and being entered into a conventional treatment (OR 3\u00b783, 95% CI 3\u00b710-4\u00b774; P < 0\u00b7001). Positive history of tuberculosis was seen in 1% of patients (n = 49).

This article gives the recommendations for the prevention and management of tuberculosis in patients with rheumatic diseases before initiating therapy with tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors. They are adapted considering the high prevalence of tuberculosis, high drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and extensive bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccination against tuberculosis in Lithuania. In order to reduce the risk of tuberculosis, the screening should be done before starting antitumor necrosis factor alpha therapy. This includes complete medical history and posterior-anterior, lateral chest radiography. Tuberculin skin test using the Mantoux method with 5 tuberculin units and interferon-gamma release assay should be performed in patients without posttuberculous radiological lesions. If Ghon's complex or untreated posttuberculous lesions are present, or if the results the Mantoux test or interferon-gamma release assay are positive, the patient should be treated for latent tuberculosis. For the treatment of latent tuberculosis, isoniazid and rifampicin are given for 3 months, and the introduction of antitumor necrosis factor alpha therapy is delayed at least for one month. In cases of suspected active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, tuberculosis should be confirmed microbiologically or morphologically, and adequate antituberculosis treatment should be initiated."

CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a DNA-binding protein that interacts with a large number of highly divergent target sequences throughout the genome. It is implicated in a variety of functions, including chromatin organization and transcriptional control. The functional role of CTCF in tumour pathogenesis remains elusive. We showed that CTCF is frequently upregulated in a subset of primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) as compared with non-tumoural liver. Overexpression of CTCF was associated with shorter disease-free survival of patients. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated suppression of CTCF inhibited cell proliferation, motility and invasiveness in HCC cell lines; these effects were correlated with prominent reductions in the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), the shelterin complex member telomerase repeat-binding factor 1, and forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1). In contrast, upregulation of CTCF was positively correlated with FOXM1 and TERT expression in clinical HCC biopsies. Depletion of CTCF resulted in reduced motility and invasiveness in HCC cells that could be reversed by ectopic expression of FOXM1, suggesting that FOXM1 is one of the important downstream effectors of CTCF in HCC. Reporter gene analysis suggested that depletion of CTCF is associated with reduced FOXM1 and TERT promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis further revealed occupancy of the FOXM1 promoter by CTCF in vivo. Importantly, depletion of CTCF by shRNA significantly inhibited tumour progression and metastasis in HCC mouse models. Our work uncovered a novel functional role of CTCF in HCC pathogenesis, which suggests that targeting CTCF could be further explored as a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

A human cell line, K562, that can be chemically induced to differentiate into various hematopoietic lineages was chosen as a model system for this study. Several K562 cell lines with constitutive and conditional expression of CTCF have been generated. By using these model systems we demonstrated that: (i) ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage; (ii) CTCF knock-down significantly inhibited differentiation of K562 cells into erythroid lineage; (iii) differentiation of K562 into the megakaryocytic lineage was not significantly affected; and (iv) down-regulation of MYC has been identified as one of the mechanisms by which CTCF promotes erythroid differentiation.

The close positioning of CTCF sites is often cell type or tissue specific. Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites around the \u03b2-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21 occupancy was reduced in the \u03b2-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293 cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2.

BACKGROUND CTCF and BORIS (CTCFL), two paralogous mammalian proteins sharing nearly identical DNA binding domains, are thought to function in a mutually exclusive manner in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. RESULTS Here we show that these two proteins co-occupy a specific subset of regulatory elements consisting of clustered CTCF binding motifs (termed 2xCTSes). BORIS occupancy at 2xCTSes is largely invariant in BORIS-positive cancer cells, with the genomic pattern recapitulating the germline-specific BORIS binding to chromatin. In contrast to the single-motif CTCF target sites (1xCTSes), the 2xCTS elements are preferentially found at active promoters and enhancers, both in cancer and germ cells. 2xCTSes are also enriched in genomic regions that escape histone to protamine replacement in human and mouse sperm. Depletion of the BORIS gene leads to altered transcription of a large number of genes and the differentiation of K562 cells, while the ectopic expression of this CTCF paralog leads to specific changes in transcription in MCF7 cells. CONCLUSIONS We discover two functionally and structurally different classes of CTCF binding regions, 2xCTSes and 1xCTSes, revealed by their predisposition to bind BORIS. We propose that 2xCTSes play key roles in the transcriptional program of cancer and germ cells."

The 11-zinc finger protein CCTC-binding factor (CTCF) employs different sets of zinc fingers to form distinct complexes with varying CTCF- target sequences (CTSs) that mediate the repression or activation of gene expression and the creation of hormone-responsive gene silencers and of diverse vertebrate enhancer-blocking elements (chromatin insulators). To determine how these varying effects would integrate in vivo, we engineered a variety of expression systems to study effects of CTCF on cell growth. Here we show that ectopic expression of CTCF in many cell types inhibits cell clonogenicity by causing profound growth retardation without apoptosis. In asynchronous cultures, the cell-cycle profile of CTCF-expressing cells remained unaltered, which suggested that progression through the cycle was slowed at multiple points. Although conditionally induced CTCF caused the S-phase block, CTCF can also arrest cell division. Viable CTCF-expressing cells could be maintained without dividing for several days. While MYC is the well-characterized CTCF target, the inhibitory effects of CTCF on cell growth could not be ascribed solely to repression of MYC, suggesting that additional CTS-driven genes involved in growth-regulatory circuits, such as p19ARF, are likely to contribute to CTCF-induced growth arrest. These findings indicate that CTCF may regulate cell-cycle progression at multiple steps within the cycle, and add to the growing evidence for the function of CTCF as a tumor suppressor gene."

Immunofluorescent staining reveals that in interphase CTCF is a nuclear protein, which is mainly excluded from the nucleolus. Strikingly, CTCF is associated with the centrosome during mitosis, especially from metaphase to anaphase. At telophase, CTCF dissociates from the centrosome and localizes to the midbody and the reformed nuclei.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency is characterized by the highly regulated transcription of a few viral genes essential for genome maintenance and host cell survival. A major latency control region has been identified upstream of the divergent promoters for the multicistronic transcripts encoding LANA (ORF73), vCyclin (ORF72), and vFLIP (ORF71) and for the complementary strand transcript encoding K14 and vGPCR (ORF74). Previous studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex. Deletion of the CTCF-cohesin binding site caused an inhibition of cell growth and viral genome instability. We now show that the KSHV genes regulated by CTCF-cohesin are under cell cycle control and that mutation of the CTCF binding sites abolished cell cycle-regulated transcription. Cohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Subcellular distribution of CTCF and colocalization with cohesins also varied across the cell cycle. Ectopic expression of Rad21 repressed CTCF-regulated transcription of KSHV lytic genes, and a Rad21-CTCF chimeric protein converted CTCF into an efficient transcriptional repressor of KSHV genes normally activated in the G(2) phase. We conclude that cohesins interact with CTCF in mid-S phase and repress CTCF-regulated genes in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival."

The cellular protooncogene MYC encodes a nuclear transcription factor that is involved in regulating important cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. Dysregulated MYC expression appears critical to the development of various types of malignancies, and thus factors involved in regulating MYC expression may also play a key role in the pathogenesis of certain cancers. We have cloned one such MYC regulatory factor, termed CTCF, which is a highly evolutionarily conserved-11-zinc finger transcriptional factor possessing multiple DNA sequence specificity. CTCF binds to a number of important regulatory regions within the 5' noncoding sequence of the human MYC oncogene, and it can regulate its transcription in several experimental systems. CTCF mRNA is expressed in cells of multiple different lineages. Enforced ectopic expression of CTCF inhibits cell growth in culture. Southern blot analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with normal human metaphase chromosomes showed that the human CTCF is a single-copy gene situated at chromosome locus 16q22. Cytogenetic studies have pointed out that chromosome abnormalities (deletions) at this locus frequently occur in many different human malignancies, suggesting the presence of one or more tumor suppressor genes in the region. To narrow down their localization, several loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies of chromosome arm 16q in sporadic breast and prostate cancers have been carried out to define the most recurrent and smallest region(s) of overlap (SRO) for commonly deleted chromosome arm 16q material. For CTCF to be considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene associated with tumorigenesis, it should localize within one of the SROs at 16q. Fine-mapping of CTCF has enabled us to assign the CTCF gene to about a 2 centiMorgan (cM) interval of 16q22.1 between the somatic cell hybrid breakpoints CY130(D) and CY4, which is between markers D16S186 (16AC16-101) and D16S496 (AFM214zg5). This relatively small region, containing the CTCF gene, overlaps the most frequently observed SROs for common chromosomal deletions found in sporadic breast and prostate tumors. In one of four analyzed paired DNA samples from primary breast cancer patients, we have detected a tumor-specific rearrangement of CTCF exons encoding the 11-zinc-finger domain. Therefore, taken together with other CTCF properties, localization of CTCF to a narrow cancer-associated chromosome region suggests that CTCF is a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene at 16q22.1."

Clinical trials involving approximately 10,000 patients (including patients from nongenital herpes studies, such as herpes zoster) have assessed the safety and efficacy of valacyclovir in the treatment of initial genital herpes outbreaks, episodic treatment of recurrent episodes and daily suppressive therapy. It was shown that valacyclovir has similar efficacy to acyclovir in the episodic and suppressive treatment of genital herpes. Valacyclovir is the only antiviral drug approved for a once-daily dose of suppressive therapy for genital herpes, as well as the only antiviral drug US FDA approved for a 3-day regimen of episodic treatment of recurrent genital herpes. In addition, valacyclovir is also indicated in the reduction of the sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus infection and for the treatment of herpes labialis. In herpes zoster, valacyclovir is more effective than acyclovir or placebo (and as equally effective as famciclovir) in shortening the length and severity of herpes zoster-associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia.

A similar estimate of 51.3% was made from urinary recovery of acyclovir. In the second study, four fasting volunteers received a single oral dose of 1,000 mg of [14C]valaciclovir. The majority of plasma radioactivity was accounted for by acyclovir, with very low plasma valaciclovir concentrations (mean maximum concentration of drug in plasma = 0.19 microM), which were undetectable after 3 h postdose. By 168 h, more than 90% of the administered radioactive dose was recovered, with approximately 45% in urine and 475 in feces. More than 99% of the radioactivity recovered in urine corresponded to acyclovir and its known metabolites, 9-(carboxymethoxymethyl)guanine and 8-hydroxy-9- [(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine, with valaciclovir accounting for less than 0.5% of the dose. Acyclovir, but no valaciclovir, was detected in fecal samples. These studies show that after oral administration to humans, valaciclovir is rapidly and virtually completely converted to acyclovir to provide a high level of acyclovir bioavailability in comparison with that following oral administration of acyclovir. The plasma acyclovir exposure obtained following oral administration of valaciclovir is similar to that achieved with doses of intravenous acyclovir, which are effective in the treatment and suppression of the less susceptible herpesviral diseases."

Famciclovir is a guanine analog antiviral drug used commonly for herpes zoster. Efficacy of famciclovir treatment has been reported to be comparable to valacyclovir treatment. Both of these medications reduce the time to complete cessation of zoster-associated pain including post-herpetic neuralgia, as compared to acyclovir. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open clinical trial in order to evaluate the extent of pain relief afforded by these two antiviral drugs during the acute disease phase of herpes zoster. The study group comprised 86 immunocompetent adult patients suffering from herpes zoster, who were treated with either famciclovir or valacyclovir for 7 days. Of these, 55 patients enrolled in this study within 72 h of the onset of the rash and 31 patients after 72 h of the onset. There was a significant reduction in acute herpes zoster pain with famciclovir on day 7 and at 2-3 weeks in both of these patient groups, while with valacyclovir, there was not significant reduction in pain on day 7. Of patients aged 50 years or older, there was a significantly earlier reduction in pain with famciclovir than with valacyclovir. In addition, a significant reduction in the number of patients with pain was observed as early as days 3-4 with famciclovir treatment as compared with valacyclovir treatment. We conclude that famciclovir was superior to valacyclovir in the relief of acute pain of herpes zoster. Accordingly, famciclovir is recommended for herpes zoster patients with moderate symptoms and a visual analog scale score of under 50 mm."

In addition, high doses of oral acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir have been shown to speed the healing of herpes zoster, and data suggests that these agents also decrease associated acute and chronic pain in people of 50 years of age or older. Further research is required to clarify the safety of these agents in pregnant women with genital herpes, the role of antiviral therapy in decreasing the sexual transmission of genital herpes, and the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these agents in treating herpes zoster in people below the age of 50 years."

Five days before admission, he visited an ophthalmologist with inflammation of the right palpebra and conjunctiva and began taking valacyclovir at a dose of 3,000 mg for the treatment of herpes zoster. Two days before admission, he was prescribed loxoprofen at a dose of 180 mg for a headache. One day prior to admission, he developed dysarthria, wandering and loss of appetite. He was subsequently admitted to our hospital with progressive deterioration of consciousness (Japan Coma Scale: II-20). On admission, he exhibited renal dysfunction, with a serum creatinine level of 5.11 mg/dl (eGFR: 9.16 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Based on his diverse symptoms and current treatment with valacyclovir, the patient was diagnosed with acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and his symptoms rapidly improved after hemodialysis. The serum acyclovir level on admission was found to be 9.25 \u03bcg/ml. Although acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity is commonly seen in elderly patients with renal dysfunction, there are also reports of this condition in patients with a normal renal function. Valacyclovir is frequently prescribed to the elderly to treat diseases such as herpes zoster. As valacyclovir induces renal dysfunction, which raises the serum acyclovir level to the toxic range, special attention must be paid when administering this drug in elderly subjects."

BACKGROUND Genital herpes and herpes labialis are prevalent, physically and psychologically painful, and often disabling. Herpes zoster is often very painful and may result in months or years of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Over the past two decades, the treatment of these conditions has been transformed by guanosine nucleoside antivirals such as valacyclovir (Valtrex, a highly bioavailable prodrug of acyclovir (Zovirax, and famciclovir (Famvir), a highly bioavailable prodrug of penciclovir (Denavir). OBJECTIVE We describe the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy of valacyclovir for the treatment of herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and other viral infections. Valacyclovir is also compared with acyclovir and famciclovir. METHODS All published literature containing the word \"valacyclovir\" was reviewed and summarized. RESULTS Valacyclovir is the only oral antiviral agent approved for therapy of herpes labialis, the only antiviral drug approved for a 3-day course in the episodic treatment of recurrent genital herpes, as well as the only antiviral drug approved for once daily dosing for suppressive therapy. In herpes zoster, valacyclovir is more effective than acyclovir and equally effective as famciclovir at hastening the healing of zoster-associated pain and PHN. CONCLUSION Valacyclovir is safe and effective in the therapy of patients with herpes simplex and herpes zoster and may be useful in other viral infections."

Treatment for PHN is initiated with antivirals during the acute herpes zoster outbreak. Acyclovir (Zoviraxr, GlaxoSmithKline), valacyclovir (Valtrex, GlaxoSmithKline) or famciclovir (Famvir, Novartis) can be used to treat herpes zoster, and all three have been shown to reduce the duration of the herpetic rash and zoster-associated pain. These antivirals are most effective when used within the first 72 hours of the onset of the rash. Side-effects of these antivirals are low and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and headache. Other treatment options for PHN include topical analgesics, opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants and gabapentin. Because of the complexity of PHN, most patients require a combination of treatment modalities for adequate pain relief."

Valaciclovir (Valtrex, Zelitrex), the L-valine ester of aciclovir, increases aciclovir bioavailability by 3- to 5-fold over that achievable with oral aciclovir. It addresses many unmet needs of currently available anti-herpesvirus therapies. Valaciclovir extends the efficacy of aciclovir in the treatment of herpes zoster and genital HSV infections, using less frequent dose regimens but retaining the highly acceptable safety profile established for aciclovir. The potential for valaciclovir in CMV prophylaxis has now been proven, and further refining to identify the optimal dose regimen is ongoing. After oral administration, valaciclovir is rapidly absorbed and extensively converted to aciclovir and L-valine, the essential amino acid. The mode of action and spectrum of antiviral activity of valaciclovir are thus identical to aciclovir. The bioavailability of aciclovir after valaciclovir, characterised from studies in healthy adult volunteers, is similar in a wide range of patient populations, including the elderly, those with advanced HIV disease, patients with impaired liver or renal function, or undergoing bone marrow transplantation. No clinically significant drug interactions with valaciclovir have so far been identified. Dosage reductions in clinical use of valaciclovir are only necessary when renal function is severely impaired. In controlled clinical trials in herpes zoster, valaciclovir (1000 mg three times daily) is superior to aciclovir in speeding the resolution of zoster-associated pain and post-herpetic neuralgia. It is as effective as aciclovir in hastening rash healing. In patients with ophthalmic zoster, no differences were evident between valaciclovir and aciclovir treatment on zoster-associated pain or the occurrence of ocular complications. The safety profiles of valaciclovir, aciclovir and placebo were not different in this study programme. In a series of controlled, randomised trials of valaciclovir, aciclovir and placebo for the acute treatment of genital HSV infections in approximately 3000 patients, twice daily valaciclovir was proven as effective as the standard 5 times daily aciclovir regimen in resolving the clinical signs and symptoms of lesional disease. Early patient-initiated valaciclovir therapy (500 mg twice daily) of recurrent genital herpes episodes was shown significantly to increase the chance of prevention of vesicular or ulcerative lesions, a valuable clinical advantage not prospectively proven for aciclovir. When used for periods of up to one year, valaciclovir (500 mg once daily) effectively suppresses genital herpes recurrences. Long-term studies of valaciclovir for HSV suppression, evaluating doses of up to 1000 mg daily in approximately 3000 patients, about 25% of whom were HIV seropositive (CD+ > 100 cells/microl), revealed a highly acceptable clinical tolerability profile for valaciclovir that did not differ from aciclovir or placebo. There were no cases resembling thrombotic microangiopathy in these long-term studies. The aciclovir safety heritage and pharmacokinetic rationale for the development of valaciclovir have been realised through the clinical research programmes in the zoster and HSV indications. Further studies in these and related areas, including CMV prophylaxis, are in progress and aim to expand further the clinical potential of valaciclovir in the future."

The quiet pandemic of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection has plagued humanity since ancient times, causing mucocutaneous infection, such as herpes labialis and herpes genitalis. Disease symptoms often interfere with everyday activities and occasionally HSV infections are the cause of life-threatening or sight-impairing disease, especially in neonates and the immunocompromised patient population. After primary or initial infection the virus persists for life in a latent form in neurons of the host, periodically reactivating and often resulting in significant psychosocial distress for the patient. Currently, no cure is available. In the mid-1950s the first antiviral, idoxuridine, was developed for topical treatment of herpes disease and, in 1978, vidarabine was licensed for systemic use to treat HSV encephalitis. Acyclovir (Zovirax), a potent, specific and tolerable nucleosidic inhibitor of the herpes DNA polymerase, was a milestone in the development of antiviral drugs in the late 1970s. In the mid-1990s, when acyclovir became a generic drug, valacyclovir (Valtrex) and famciclovir (Famvir), prodrugs of the gold standard and penciclovir (Denavir), Vectavir), a close analogue, were launched. Though numerous approaches and strategies were tested and considerable effort was expended in the search of the next generation of an antiherpetic therapy, it proved difficult to outperform acyclovir. Notable in this regard was the award of a Nobel Prize in 1988 for the elucidation of mechanistic principles which resulted in the development of new drugs such as acyclovir. Vaccines, interleukins, interferons, therapeutic proteins, antibodies, immunomodulators and small-molecule drugs with specific or nonspecific modes of action lacked either efficacy or the required safety profile to replace the nucleosidic drugs acyclovir, valacyclovir, penciclovir and famciclovir as the first choice of treatment. Recently though, new inhibitors of the HSV helicase-primase with potent in vitro antiherpes activity, novel mechanisms of action, low resistance rates and superior efficacy against HSV in animal models have been discovered. This review summarises the current therapeutic options, discusses the potential of preclinical or investigational drugs and provides an up-to-date interpretation of the challenge to establish novel treatments for herpes simplex disease."

XMAP215, CLASP, and Crescerin use arrayed tubulin-binding tumor overexpressed gene (TOG) domains to modulate microtubule dynamics. We hypothesized that TOGs have distinct architectures and tubulin-binding properties that underlie each family's ability to promote microtubule polymerization or pause. As a model, we investigated the pentameric TOG array of a Drosophila melanogaster XMAP215 member, Msps. We found that Msps TOGs have distinct architectures that bind either free or polymerized tubulin, and that a polarized array drives microtubule polymerization. An engineered TOG1-2-5 array fully supported Msps-dependent microtubule polymerase activity. Requisite for this activity was a TOG5-specific N-terminal HEAT repeat that engaged microtubule lattice-incorporated tubulin. TOG5-microtubule binding maintained mitotic spindle formation as deleting or mutating TOG5 compromised spindle architecture and increased the mitotic index. Mad2 knockdown released the spindle assembly checkpoint triggered when TOG5-microtubule binding was compromised, indicating that TOG5 is essential for spindle function. Our results reveal a TOG5-specific role in mitotic fidelity and support our hypothesis that architecturally distinct TOGs arranged in a sequence-specific order underlie TOG array microtubule regulator activity."

Rab7 GTPase siRNA knocking down in isolated bone marrow lal-/- MDSCs or HD1B cells not only reduced over-activation of mTOR and its downstream effector S6, but also decreased glucose consumption, decreased ROS over-production, and increased healthy mitochondria by membrane potential measurement.

Rap1-interacting factor 1 (Rif1) was originally identified in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a telomere-binding protein that negatively regulates telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. Although this function is conserved in the distantly related fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, recent studies, both in yeasts and in metazoans, reveal that Rif1 also functions more globally, both in the temporal control of DNA replication and in DNA repair. Rif1 proteins are large and characterized by N-terminal HEAT repeats, predicted to form an elongated alpha-helical structure. In addition, all Rif1 homologs contain two short motifs, abbreviated RVxF/SILK, that are implicated in recruitment of the PP1 (yeast Glc7) phosphatase. In yeasts the RVxF/SILK domains have been shown to play a role in control of DNA replication initiation, at least in part through targeted de-phosphorylation of proteins in the pre-Replication Complex. In human cells Rif1 is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks through an interaction with 53BP1 where it counteracts DNA resection, thus promoting repair by non-homologous end-joining. This function requires the N-terminal HEAT repeat-containing domain. Interestingly, this domain is also implicated in DNA end protection at un-capped telomeres in yeast. We conclude by discussing the deployment of Rif1 at telomeres in yeasts from both an evolutionary perspective and in light of its recently discovered global functions."

Elucidating mechanisms of chemoresistance is critical to improve cancer therapy, especially for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Genome-wide association studies have suggested the less studied gene HEAT repeat-containing protein 1 (HEATR1) as a possible determinant of cellular sensitivity to different chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we assessed this hypothesized link in PDAC, where HEATR1 expression is downregulated significantly. HEATR1 silencing in PDAC cells increased resistance to gemcitabine and other chemotherapeutics, where this effect was associated with increased AKT kinase phosphorylation at the Thr308 regulatory site. Mechanistically, HEATR1 enhanced cell responsiveness to gemcitabine by acting as a scaffold to facilitate interactions between AKT and the protein phosphatase PP2A, thereby promoting Thr308 dephosphorylation. Consistent with these findings, treatment with the AKT inhibitor triciribine sensitized HEATR1-depleted PDAC cells to gemcitabine, suggesting that this therapeutic combination may overcome gemcitabine resistance in patients with low HEATR1 expression. Clinically, we found that HEATR1 downregulation in PDAC patients was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, poor response to tumor resection plus gemcitabine standard-of-care treatment, and shorter overall survival. Collectively, our findings establish HEATR1 as a novel regulator of AKT and a candidate predictive and prognostic indicator of drug responsiveness and outcome in PDAC patients."

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) enzyme consists of a heterodimeric core (AC core) comprising a scaffolding subunit (A), a catalytic subunit (C), and a variable regulatory subunit (B). Earlier studies suggest that upon DNA damage, a specific B subunit, B56\u03b3, bridges the PP2A AC core to p53, leading to dephosphorylation of p53 at Thr-55, induction of the p53 transcriptional target p21, and the inhibition of cell proliferation and transformation. In addition to dephosphorylation of p53, B56\u03b3-PP2A also inhibits cell proliferation and transformation by an unknown mechanism. B56\u03b3 contains 18 \u03b1-helices that are organized into eight HEAT (Huntington-elongation-A subunit-TOR) repeat motifs. Although previous crystal structure study has revealed the residues of B56\u03b3 that directly contact the A and C subunits, the contribution of HEAT repeats to holoenzyme assembly and to B56\u03b3-PP2A tumor-suppressive function remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that HEAT repeat 1 is required for the interaction of B56\u03b3 with the PP2A AC core and, more importantly, for B56\u03b3-PP2A tumor-suppressive function. Within this region, we identified a tumor-associated mutation, C39R, which disrupts the interaction of B56\u03b3 with the AC core and thus was unable to mediate dephosphorylation of p53 by PP2A. Furthermore, due to its lack of AC interaction, C39R was also unable to promote the p53-independent tumor-suppressive function of B56\u03b3-PP2A. This study provides structural insight into the PP2A holoenzyme assembly and emphasizes the importance of HEAT repeat 1 in B56\u03b3-PP2A tumor-suppressive function."

Ibudilast (IBD) is a non\u2011selective (3, 4, 10, 11) phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, used mainly as a bronchodilator for the treatment of bronchial asthma. PDE play a central role in cellular function (e.g. differentiation, synaptic plasticity and inflammatory response) by metabolizing cyclic nucleotides. The results from preclinical and clinical studies indicate that IBD has a broader range of action through suppression of pro\u2011inflammatory cytokines (IL\u20116, IL\u20111\u03b2, TNF\u2011\u03b1), toll\u2011like receptor 4 blockade (TLR\u20114), inhibition of a macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), up\u2011regulation the anti\u2011inflammatory cytokine (IL\u201110), and promotion of neurotrophic factors (GDNF, NGF, NT\u20114). Recent data indicate that the efficacy of IBD appears to be independent from PDE inhibition activity and rather linked to glial activity attenuation. Additional advantages of IBD, such as crossing the blood-brain barrier, good tolerance and activity by oral administration, makes it a promising therapeutic candidate for treating neuroinflammatory conditions, where the currently available treatment remains unsatisfying due to poor tolerability and/or sub\u2011optimal efficacy.

Despite the fact that majority of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have relapsing-remitting disease, many transition to secondary progressive disease (SPMS) over time. This transition is thought to be related to neurodegenerative processes increasingly predominating over inflammatory processes as the driving forces of disability. However, some patients initially present with primary progressive disease (PPMS) that is characterized by a gradual accumulation of neurological symptoms and subsequent disability accumulation. The treatment of both PPMS and SPMS, collectively referred to as progressive MS, has proven quite challenging due to the multifactorial and poorly understood pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis in general, specifically that of progressive disease. The purpose of this article is to discuss important clinical and pathophysiologic differences between relapsing and progressive forms of MS, review previous notable trials of drugs in progressive MS, examine current literature regarding recent and promising progressive MS treatments, and discuss future considerations for progressive MS therapeutics and management. Specifically, the current evidence regarding treatment of progressive MS with ocrelizumab, simvastatin, ibudilast, alpha-lipoic acid, high-dose biotin, siponimod, and cell-based therapies are discussed."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS), often first affecting people in early adulthood. Although most MS patients have a relapsing-remitting course (RRMS) at disease onset, a substantial proportion later develop chronic progression, termed secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Approximately 10% of MS patients experience chronic progression from disease onset, termed primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Although several disease-modifying treatment (DMT) options exist for relapsing forms of this disease, DMT options are few for progressive MS (PPMS and SPMS). Herein, we strive to define progressive MS, review major clinical trials aimed at progressive MS, and delineate potential strategies in the management of progressive MS. RECENT FINDINGS In 2017, the first DMT for PPMS, the B lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody, ocrelizumab, came to market. Ocrelizumab reduced 12-week confirmed disability progression (CDP) by 24% versus placebo. Siponimod, a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, reduced 3-month CDP by 21% versus placebo in SPMS. Ibudilast slowed brain atrophy in PPMS and SPMS patients in a multicenter phase 2b study. Smaller early phase studies of alpha-lipoic acid and simvastatin each found slowing of rate of whole brain atrophy in SPMS patients. Reasons now exist for optimism in the search for DMTs for progressive MS. It remains a challenge to identify outcome measures that accurately reflect the underlying pathology in progressive MS, which is less inflammatory and more degenerative than RRMS."

INTRODUCTION Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammatory demyelination and progressive axonal loss. Clinically, this is manifest as relapsing and remitting neurological symptoms and progressive accumulation of disability. Ibudilast is a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which works by blocking the cleavage of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). It has been found to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in animal studies and in-vitro studies; it is currently being studied in progressive MS. AREAS COVERED This article reviews various studies looking at ibudilast as a potential therapy for MS. It summarizes prior and current clinical trials of ibudilast in MS as well as its pharmacology. EXPERT OPINION Although ibudilast has not been found to decrease the focal inflammatory activity in relapsing MS, it was shown to have an effect on preserving brain volume and disability progression. Ibudilast may have a role in the treatment of progressive MS phenotypes."

Ibudilast inhibits several cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, and toll-like receptor 4 and can cross the blood-brain barrier, with potential salutary effects in progressive multiple sclerosis. METHODS We enrolled patients with primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in a phase 2 randomized trial of oral ibudilast (\u2264100 mg daily) or placebo for 96 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the rate of brain atrophy, as measured by the brain parenchymal fraction (brain size relative to the volume of the outer surface contour of the brain). Major secondary end points included the change in the pyramidal tracts on diffusion tensor imaging, the magnetization transfer ratio in normal-appearing brain tissue, the thickness of the retinal nerve-fiber layer, and cortical atrophy, all measures of tissue damage in multiple sclerosis. RESULTS Of 255 patients who underwent randomization, 129 were assigned to ibudilast and 126 to placebo. A total of 53% of the patients in the ibudilast group and 52% of those in the placebo group had primary progressive disease; the others had secondary progressive disease. The rate of change in the brain parenchymal fraction was -0.0010 per year with ibudilast and -0.0019 per year with placebo (difference, 0.0009; 95% confidence interval, 0.00004 to 0.0017; P=0.04), which represents approximately 2.5 ml less brain-tissue loss with ibudilast over a period of 96 weeks. Adverse events with ibudilast included gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and depression. CONCLUSIONS In a phase 2 trial involving patients with progressive multiple sclerosis, ibudilast was associated with slower progression of brain atrophy than placebo but was associated with higher rates of gastrointestinal side effects, headache, and depression.

BACKGROUND Ibudilast is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor influencing inflammation and neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS). This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and effects on MRI parameters of 2 different doses of ibudilast in relapsing forms of MS. METHODS In this multicenter, double-blind, phase 2 trial, patients with relapsing MS and gadolinium-enhancing lesions were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive 30 or 60 mg ibudilast or placebo every day for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the cumulative number of newly active lesions on bimonthly brain MRI over 12 months. Secondary endpoints included relapse rate, change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, T2-hyperintense and T1-hypointense lesion volumes, and percent brain volume change (PBVC). RESULTS A total of 297 patients were randomized in 19 centers. During the first 12 months, the mean number of active lesions and relapse rate did not differ between treatment arms. A reduction in PBVC (p = 0.04) was found in the 60-mg group (0.8%) compared with placebo (1.2%). Post hoc analysis showed a reduction in the proportion active lesions that evolved into persistent black holes for the 60-mg (0.14; p = 0.004) and 30-mg (0.17; p = 0.036) groups compared with the placebo group (0.24). Over 2 years, there were fewer patients (p = 0.026) with confirmed progression on the EDSS. Treatment with ibudilast was generally safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSION Ibudilast showed no beneficial effect on the rate of newly active lesions and relapses. However, preliminary evidence suggests that ibudilast seems to act in a neuroprotective fashion as measured by 2 independent MRI outcomes, with a possible beneficial clinical effect on disability progression.

BACKGROUND Primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), collectively called progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS), is characterized by gradual progression of disability. The current anti-inflammatory treatments for MS have little or no efficacy in PMS in the absence of obvious active inflammation. Optimal biomarkers for phase II PMS trials is unknown. Ibudilast is an inhibitor of macrophage migration inhibitor factor and phosphodiesterases-4 and -10 and exhibits possible neuroprotective properties. The goals of SPRINT-MS study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ibudilast in PMS and to directly compare several imaging metrics for utility in PMS trials. METHODS SPRINT-MS is a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II trial of ibudilast in patients with PMS. Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either ibudilast (100mg/day) or placebo for 96weeks. Imaging is conducted every 24weeks for whole brain atrophy, magnetization transfer ratio, diffusion tensor imaging, cortical brain atrophy, and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Clinical outcomes include neurologic disability and patient reported quality of life. Safety assessments include laboratory testing, electrocardiography, and suicidality screening. RESULTS A total of 331 subjects were enrolled, of which 255 were randomized onto active study treatment. Randomized subjects were 53.7% female and mean age 55.7 (SD 7.3) years. The last subject is projected to complete the study in May 2017. CONCLUSION SPRINT-MS is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ibudilast as a treatment for PMS while simultaneously validating five different imaging biomarkers as outcome metrics for use in future phase II proof-of-concept PMS trials."

In this article, I present a historical perspective on the development of camelid single-domain antibodies (sdAbs or VHHs, also widely known as nanobodies) since their discovery and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these unique molecules in various areas of research, industry, and medicine. Commercialization of camelid sdAbs exploded in 2001 with a flurry of patents issued to the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and later taken on by the Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) and, after 2002, the VIB-founded spin-off company, Ablynx. While entrepreneurial spirit has certainly catalyzed the exploration of nanobodies as marketable products, IP restrictions may be partially responsible for the relatively long time span between the discovery of these biomolecules and their entry into the pharmaceutical market. It is now anticipated that the first VHH-based antibody drug, Caplacizumab, a bivalent anti-vWF antibody for treating rare blood clotting disorders, may be approved and commercialized in 2018 or shortly thereafter. This elusive first approval, along with the expiry of key patents, may substantially alter the scientific and biomedical landscape surrounding camelid sdAbs and pave the way for their emergence as mainstream biotherapeutics."

Essentials Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is linked with significant morbidity/mortality. Caplacizumab's effect on major thromboembolic (TE) events, exacerbations and death was studied. Fewer caplacizumab-treated patients had a major TE event, an exacerbation, or died versus placebo. Caplacizumab has the potential to reduce the acute morbidity and mortality associated with aTTP. SUMMARY Background Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is a life-threatening autoimmune thrombotic microangiopathy. In spite of treatment with plasma exchange and immunosuppression, patients remain at risk for thrombotic complications, exacerbations, and death. In the phase II TITAN study, treatment with caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor Nanobody\u00ae was shown to reduce the time to confirmed platelet count normalization and exacerbations during treatment. Objective The clinical benefit of caplacizumab was further investigated in a post hoc analysis of the incidence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations during the study drug treatment period and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-related death during the study. Methods The Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query (SMQ) for 'embolic and thrombotic events' was run to investigate the occurrence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations in the safety population of the TITAN study, which consisted of 72 patients, of whom 35 received caplacizumab and 37 received placebo. Results Four events (one pulmonary embolism and three aTTP exacerbations) were reported in four patients in the caplacizumab group, and 20 such events were reported in 14 patients in the placebo group (two acute myocardial infarctions, one ischemic stroke, one hemorrhagic stroke, one pulmonary embolism, one deep vein thrombosis, one venous thrombosis, and 13 aTTP exacerbations). Two of the placebo-treated patients died from aTTP during the study. Conclusion In total, 11.4% of caplacizumab-treated patients and 43.2% of placebo-treated patients experienced one or more major thromboembolic events, experienced an exacerbation, or died. This analysis shows the potential for caplacizumab to reduce the risk of major thromboembolic morbidities and mortality associated with aTTP."

Daily therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) transformed the historically fatal prognosis of acquired, anti-ADAMTS13 antibody-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), leading to the current overall survival rates of >80%. However, relapses occur in up to 40% of patients and refractory disease with fatal outcomes still occurs. In this context, the introduction of rituximab has probably been the second major breakthrough in TTP management. Rituximab is now routinely recommended during the acute phase, typically in patients with a suboptimal response to treatment, or even as frontline therapy, with high response rates.

BACKGROUND Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is caused by aggregation of platelets on ultralarge von Willebrand factor multimers. This microvascular thrombosis causes multiorgan ischemia with potentially life-threatening complications. Daily plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapies induce remission, but mortality and morbidity due to microthrombosis remain high. METHODS Caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor humanized single-variable-domain immunoglobulin (Nanobody), inhibits the interaction between ultralarge von Willebrand factor multimers and platelets. In this phase 2, controlled study, we randomly assigned patients with acquired TTP to subcutaneous caplacizumab (10 mg daily) or placebo during plasma exchange and for 30 days afterward. The primary end point was the time to a response, defined as confirmed normalization of the platelet count. Major secondary end points included exacerbations and relapses. RESULTS Seventy-five patients underwent randomization (36 were assigned to receive caplacizumab, and 39 to receive placebo). The time to a response was significantly reduced with caplacizumab as compared with placebo (39% reduction in median time, P=0.005). Three patients in the caplacizumab group had an exacerbation, as compared with 11 patients in the placebo group. Eight patients in the caplacizumab group had a relapse in the first month after stopping the study drug, of whom 7 had ADAMTS13 activity that remained below 10%, suggesting unresolved autoimmune activity. Bleeding-related adverse events, most of which were mild to moderate in severity, were more common with caplacizumab than with placebo (54% of patients vs. 38%). The frequencies of other adverse events were similar in the two groups. Two patients in the placebo group died, as compared with none in the caplacizumab group. CONCLUSIONS Caplacizumab induced a faster resolution of the acute TTP episode than did placebo. The platelet-protective effect of caplacizumab was maintained during the treatment period. Caplacizumab was associated with an increased tendency toward bleeding, as compared with placebo. (Funded by Ablynx; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01151423.)."

METHODS We conducted a phase 2, single-cohort, 25-center, global study of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. The primary end point was the overall remission rate (the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 3 months. RESULTS For this planned analysis, 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and could be evaluated for efficacy. The overall remission rate within 3 months was 81%, with all patients who had a response to treatment found to be negative for minimal residual disease, as assessed by means of flow cytometry. The rates of event-free survival and overall survival were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60 to 82) and 90% (95% CI, 81 to 95), respectively, at 6 months and 50% (95% CI, 35 to 64) and 76% (95% CI, 63 to 86) at 12 months. The median duration of remission was not reached. Persistence of tisagenlecleucel in the blood was observed for as long as 20 months. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel occurred in 73% of patients. The cytokine release syndrome occurred in 77% of patients, 48% of whom received tocilizumab. Neurologic events occurred in 40% of patients and were managed with supportive care, and no cerebral edema was reported. CONCLUSIONS In this global study of CAR T-cell therapy, a single infusion of tisagenlecleucel provided durable remission with long-term persistence in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, with transient high-grade toxic effects.

The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel targets and eliminates CD19-expressing B cells and showed efficacy against B-cell lymphomas in a single-center, phase 2a study. METHODS We conducted an international, phase 2, pivotal study of centrally manufactured tisagenlecleucel involving adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who were ineligible for or had disease progression after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The primary end point was the best overall response rate (i.e., the percentage of patients who had a complete or partial response), as judged by an independent review committee. RESULTS A total of 93 patients received an infusion and were included in the evaluation of efficacy. The median time from infusion to data cutoff was 14 months (range, 0.1 to 26). The best overall response rate was 52% (95% confidence interval, 41 to 62); 40% of the patients had complete responses, and 12% had partial responses. Response rates were consistent across prognostic subgroups. At 12 months after the initial response, the rate of relapse-free survival was estimated to be 65% (79% among patients with a complete response). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events of special interest included cytokine release syndrome (22%), neurologic events (12%), cytopenias lasting more than 28 days (32%), infections (20%), and febrile neutropenia (14%). Three patients died from disease progression within 30 days after infusion. No deaths were attributed to tisagenlecleucel, cytokine release syndrome, or cerebral edema. No differences between response groups in tumor expression of CD19 or immune checkpoint-related proteins were found.

BACKGROUND Anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy has demonstrated high response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B cell malignancies but is associated with significant toxicity. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most significant complication associated with CAR T cell therapy, and it is critical to have a reproducible and easy method to grade CRS after CAR T cell infusions. DISCUSSION The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale is inadequate for grading CRS associated with cellular therapy. Clinical experience with the anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy tisagenlecleucel at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) was used to develop the Penn grading scale for CRS. The Penn grading scale depends on easily accessible clinical features; does not rely on location of care or quantitation of supportive care; assigns grades to guide CRS management; distinguishes between mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening CRS; and applies to both early-onset and delayed-onset CRS associated with T cell therapies. Clinical data from 55 pediatric patients with r/r B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 42 patients with r/r chronic lymphocytic lymphoma treated with tisagenlecleucel were used to demonstrate the current application of the Penn grading scale. CONCLUSION We show that the Penn grading scale provides reproducible CRS grading that can be useful to guide therapy and that can be applied across clinical trials and treatment platforms."

PURPOSE Tisagenlecleucel is an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19) T-cell therapy approved for the treatment of children and young adults with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS We evaluated the cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel, the effect of patient factors, humoral immunogenicity, and manufacturing attributes on its kinetics, and exposure-response analysis for efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints in 79 patients across two studies in pediatric B-ALL (ELIANA and ENSIGN). RESULTS Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction to quantify levels of tisagenlecleucel transgene, responders (N = 62) had \u22482-fold higher tisagenlecleucel expansion in peripheral blood than nonresponders (N = 8; 74% and 104% higher geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-28d, respectively) with persistence measurable beyond 2 years in responding patients. Cmax increased with occurrence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Tisagenlecleucel continued to expand and persist following tocilizumab, used to manage CRS. Patients with B-cell recovery within 6 months had earlier loss of the transgene compared with patients with sustained clinical response. Clinical responses were seen across the entire dose range evaluated (patients \u226450 kg: 0.2 to 5.0 \u00d7 106/kg; patients >50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5 \u00d7 108 CAR-positive viable T cells) with no relationship between dose and safety. Neither preexisting nor treatment-induced antimurine CAR19 antibodies affected the persistence or clinical response. CONCLUSIONS Response to tisagenlecleucel was associated with increased expansion across a wide dose range.

The TYRO3, AXL (also known as UFO) and MERTK (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are aberrantly expressed in multiple haematological and epithelial malignancies. Rather than functioning as oncogenic drivers, their induction in tumour cells predominately promotes survival, chemoresistance and motility. The unique mode of maximal activation of this RTK family requires an extracellular lipid\u2013protein complex. For example, the protein ligand, growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6), binds to phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) that is externalized on apoptotic cell membranes, which activates MERTK on macrophages. This triggers engulfment of apoptotic material and subsequent anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization. In tumours, autocrine and paracrine ligands and apoptotic cells are abundant, which provide a survival signal to the tumour cell and favour an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive microenvironment. Thus, TAM kinase inhibition could stimulate antitumour immunity, reduce tumour cell survival, enhance chemosensitivity and diminish metastatic potential."

Severe hepatic inflammation is a common cause of acute or chronic liver disease. Macrophages are one of the key mediators which regulate the progress of hepatic inflammation. Increasing evidence shows that the TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) family of RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases), which is expressed in macrophages, alleviates inflammatory responses through a negative feedback loop. However, the functional contribution of each TAM family member to the progression of hepatic inflammation remains elusive. In this study, we explore the role of individual TAM family proteins during autophagy induction and evaluate their contribution to hepatic inflammation. Among the TAM family of RTKs, AXL (AXL receptor tyrosine kinase) only induces autophagy in macrophages after interaction with its ligand, GAS6 (growth arrest specific 6). Based on our results, autophosphorylation of 2 tyrosine residues (Tyr815 and Tyr860) in the cytoplasmic domain of AXL in mice is required for autophagy induction and AXL-mediated autophagy induction is dependent on MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)14 activity. Furthermore, induction of AXL-mediated autophagy prevents CASP1 (caspase 1)-dependent IL1B (interleukin 1, \u03b2) and IL18 (interleukin 18) maturation by inhibiting NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome activation. In agreement with these observations, axl-/- mice show more severe symptoms than do wild-type (Axl+/+) mice following acute hepatic injury induced by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Hence, GAS6-AXL signaling-mediated autophagy induction in murine macrophages ameliorates hepatic inflammatory responses by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation."

Deregulation of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) has recently been demonstrated to predominately promote survival and chemoresistance of cancer cells. Intramembrane proteolysis mediated by presenilin/\u03b3-secretase is known to regulate the homeostasis of some RTKs. In the present study, we demonstrate that AXL, but not TYRO3 or MERTK, is efficiently and sequentially cleaved by \u03b1- and \u03b3-secretases in various types of cancer cell lines. Proteolytic processing of AXL redirected signaling toward a secretase-mediated pathway, away from the classic, well-known, ligand-dependent canonical RTK signaling pathway. The AXL intracellular domain cleavage product, but not full-length AXL, was further shown to translocate into the nucleus via a nuclear localization sequence that harbored a basic HRRKK motif. Of interest, we found that the \u03b3-secretase-uncleavable AXL mutant caused an elevated chemoresistance in non-small-cell lung cancer cells. Altogether, our findings suggest that AXL can undergo sequential processing mediated by various proteases kept in a homeostatic balance. This newly discovered post-translational processing of AXL may provide an explanation for the diverse functions of AXL, especially in the context of drug resistance in cancer cells.-Lu, Y., Wan, J., Yang, Z., Lei, X., Niu, Q., Jiang, L., Passtoors, W.

Tyro-3, Axl, and Mer constitute the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) characterized by a conserved sequence within the kinase domain and adhesion molecule-like extracellular domains. This small family of RTKs regulates an intriguing mix of processes, including cell proliferation/survival, cell adhesion and migration, blood clot stabilization, and regulation of inflammatory cytokine release. Genetic or experimental alteration of TAM receptor function can contribute to a number of disease states, including coagulopathy, autoimmune disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and cancer. In this chapter, we first provide a comprehensive review of the structure, regulation, biologic functions, and downstream signaling pathways of these receptors. In addition, we discuss recent evidence which suggests a role for TAM receptors in oncogenic mechanisms as family members are overexpressed in a spectrum of human cancers and have prognostic significance in some. Possible strategies for targeted inhibition of the TAM family in the treatment of human cancer are described. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the full clinical implications of TAM family expression and activation in cancer."

Proteases known as sheddases cleave the extracellular domains of their substrates from the cell surface. The A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 are among the most prominent sheddases, being widely expressed in many tissues, frequently overexpressed in cancer, and promiscuously cleaving diverse substrates. It is increasingly clear that the proteolytic shedding of transmembrane receptors impacts pathophysiology and drug response. Receptor substrates of sheddases include the cytokine receptors TNFR1 and IL6R; the Notch receptors; type-I and -III TGF\u03b2 receptors; receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as HER2, HER4, and VEGFR2; and, in particular, MET and TAM-family RTKs AXL and Mer (MerTK). Activation of receptor shedding by mechanical cues, hypoxia, radiation, and phosphosignaling offers insight into mechanisms of drug resistance. This particularly holds for kinase inhibitors targeting BRAF (such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib) and MEK (such as trametinib and cobimetinib), along with direct sheddase inhibitors. Receptor proteolysis can be detected in patient fluids and is especially relevant in melanoma, glioblastoma, lung cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer where RTK substrates, MAPK signaling, and ADAMs are frequently dysregulated.

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been demonstrated to signal via regulated intramembrane proteolysis, in which ectodomain shedding and subsequent intramembrane cleavage by gamma-secretase leads to release of a soluble intracellular receptor fragment with functional activity. For most RTKs, however, it is unknown whether they can exploit this new signaling mechanism. Here we used a system-wide screen to address the frequency of susceptibility to gamma-secretase cleavage among human RTKs. The screen covering 45 of the 55 human RTKs identified 12 new as well as all nine previously published gamma-secretase substrates. We biochemically validated the screen by demonstrating that the release of a soluble intracellular fragment from endogenous AXL was dependent on the sheddase disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) and the gamma-secretase component presenilin-1. Functional analysis of the cleavable RTKs indicated that proliferation promoted by overexpression of the TAM family members AXL or TYRO3 depends on gamma-secretase cleavage.

OBJECTIVE The SAD PERSONS scale is a widely used risk assessment tool for suicidal behavior despite a paucity of supporting data. The objective of this study was to examine the ability of the scale in predicting suicide attempts. METHOD Participants consisted of consecutive referrals (N=4,019) over 2 years (January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010) to psychiatric services in the emergency departments of the 2 largest tertiary care hospitals in the province of Manitoba, Canada. SAD PERSONS and Modified SAD PERSONS (MSPS) scale scores were recorded for individuals at their index and all subsequent presentations. The 2 main outcome measures in the study included current suicide attempts (at index presentation) and future suicide attempts (within the next 6 months). The ability of the scales to predict suicide attempts was evaluated with logistic regression, sensitivity and specificity analyses, and receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS 566 people presented with suicide attempts (14.1% of the sample). Both SAD PERSONS and MSPS showed poor predictive ability for future suicide attempts. Compared to low risk scores, high risk baseline scores had low sensitivity (19.6% and 40.0%, respectively) and low positive predictive value (5.3% and 7.4%, respectively). SAD PERSONS did not predict suicide attempts better than chance (area under the curve =0.572; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.64; P value nonsignificant). Stepwise regression identified 5 original scale items that accounted for the greatest proportion of future suicide attempt variance. High risk scores using this model had high sensitivity (93.5%) and were associated with a 5-fold higher likelihood of future suicide attempt presentation (odds ratio =5.58; 95% CI, 2.24-13.86; P<.001).

MEASUREMENTS Short sleep was defined by self-assessment as \u2264 5 h per day. The MINI and the DSM-IV version of the International Personality Disorder Examination Screening Questionnaire were used to diagnose Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, respectively. Suicide intent and lethality were evaluated through the Beck's Suicidal Intent Scale (SIS) and the Risk-Rescue Rating Scale (RRRS), respectively.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses explored frequencies of short sleep in 3 samples. Chi-square tests explored whether or not suicide intent, lethality and risk were greater in SAs with short-sleep versus those without short-sleep. RESULTS Short sleep was more prevalent in SAs than in psychiatric controls only in males. In female SAs, short sleep was significantly associated with several SIS items and high scores in the SAD PERSONS. LIMITATIONS Sleep duration was assessed only by self-report.

However, there is evidence that their diagnostic accuracy in predicting repeat self-harm is limited. Their predictive accuracy in population settings, and in identifying those at highest risk of suicide is not known. METHOD We compared the predictive accuracy of the Manchester Self-Harm Rule (MSHR), ReACT Self-Harm Rule (ReACT), SAD PERSONS Scale (SPS) and Modified SAD PERSONS Scale (MSPS) in an unselected sample of patients attending hospital following self-harm. Data on 4000 episodes of self-harm presenting to Emergency Departments (ED) between 2010 and 2012 were obtained from four established monitoring systems in England. Episodes were assigned a risk category for each scale and followed up for 6 months. RESULTS The episode-based repeat rate was 28% (1133/4000) and the incidence of suicide was 0.5% (18/3962). The MSHR and ReACT performed with high sensitivity (98% and 94% respectively) and low specificity (15% and 23%). The SPS and the MSPS performed with relatively low sensitivity (24-29% and 9-12% respectively) and high specificity (76-77% and 90%).

OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between various suicide screening tools and clinical impression with subsequent patient psychiatric admission and near-term adverse emergency department (ED) events. METHODS We performed a prospective observational study of 50 patients with suicidal ideation in the ED. Subjects completed a series of depression/suicide screening tools: the Columbia Suicide Severity Scale, SAD PERSONS scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. Clinicians were also asked about their impression on likelihood of patient admission. Outcome measures were as follows: need for psychiatric hospital admission, prolonged stay at psychiatric facility, and any adverse events during ED stay including need for unscheduled psychiatric or sedating medications, need for physical restraints, and need for intervention by security staff. RESULTS The Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and Columbia Suicide Severity Scale did not significantly predict within-ED adverse events or admissions to psychiatric facilities. Wald test for individual parameters at an \u03b1 of .10 level found that patients who were screened positive by their nurse had 3.37 times the odds of adverse within-ED events; patients with a positive SAD PERSONS score had 8.18 times the odds of psychiatric admission greater than 5 days.

BACKGROUND Past and repeated self-harm are long-term risks to completed suicide. A brief rating scale to assess repetition risk of self-harm is important for high-risk identification and early interventions in suicide prevention. The study aimed to examine the validity of the Chinese SAD PERSONS Scale (CSPS) and to evaluate its feasibility in clinical settings. METHODS One hundred and forty-seven patients with self-harm were recruited from the Emergency Department and assessed at baseline and the sixth month. The controls, 284 people without self-harm from the Family Medicine Department in the same hospital were recruited and assessed concurrently. The psychometric properties of the CSPS were examined using baseline and follow-up measurements that assessed a variety of suicide risk factors. Clinical feasibility and applicability of the CSPS were further evaluated by a group of general nurses who used case vignette approach in CSPS risk assessment in clinical settings. An open-ended question inquiring their opinions of scale adaptation to hospital inpatient assessment for suicide risks were also analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS The CSPS was significantly correlated with other scales measuring depression, hopelessness and suicide ideation. A cut-off point of the scale was at 4/5 in predicting 6-month self-harm repetition with the sensitivity and specificity being 65.4% and 58.1%, respectively. Based on the areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, the predictive validity of the scale showed a better performance than the other scales.

METHODS Five thousand four hundred sixty-two consecutive adults were seen by psychiatry consultation teams in two tertiary emergency departments with linkage to population-based administrative data to determine suicide deaths within 6 months, 1, and 5 years. RESULTS Seventy-seven (1.4%) individuals died by suicide during the study period. When predicting suicide at 12 months, medium- and high-risk scores on SPS had a sensitivity of 49% and a specificity of 60%; the positive and negative predictive values were 0.9 and 99%, respectively. Half of the suicides at both 6- and 12-month intervals were classified as low risk by SPS at index visit. The area under the curve at 12 months for the Modified SPS was 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI] range 0.51-0.67).

Identifying the biological substrates of complex neurobehavioral traits such as alcohol dependency pose a tremendous challenge given the diverse model systems and phenotypic assessments used. To address this problem we have developed a platform for integrated analysis of high-throughput or genome-wide functional genomics studies. A wealth of such data exists, but it is often found in disparate, non-computable forms. Our interactive web-based software system, Gene Weaver (http://www.geneweaver.org), couples curated results from genomic studies to graph-theoretical tools for combinatorial analysis. Using this system we identified a gene underlying multiple alcohol-related phenotypes in four species. A search of over 60,000 gene sets in GeneWeaver's database revealed alcohol-related experimental results including genes identified in mouse genetic mapping studies, alcohol selected Drosophila lines, Rattus differential expression, and human alcoholic brains. We identified highly connected genes and compared these to genes currently annotated to alcohol-related behaviors and processes. The most highly connected gene not annotated to alcohol was Pafah1b1. Experimental validation using a Pafah1b1 conditional knock-out mouse confirmed that this gene is associated with an increased preference for alcohol and an altered thermoregulatory response to alcohol. Although this gene has not been previously implicated in alcohol-related behaviors, its function in various neural mechanisms makes a role in alcohol-related phenomena plausible. By making diverse cross-species functional genomics data readily computable, we were able to identify and confirm a novel alcohol-related gene that may have implications for alcohol use disorders and other effects of alcohol."

High-throughput genome technologies have produced a wealth of data on the association of genes and gene products to biological functions. Investigators have discovered value in combining their experimental results with published genome-wide association studies, quantitative trait locus, microarray, RNA-sequencing and mutant phenotyping studies to identify gene-function associations across diverse experiments, species, conditions, behaviors or biological processes. These experimental results are typically derived from disparate data repositories, publication supplements or reconstructions from primary data stores. This leaves bench biologists with the complex and unscalable task of integrating data by identifying and gathering relevant studies, reanalyzing primary data, unifying gene identifiers and applying ad hoc computational analysis to the integrated set. The freely available GeneWeaver (http://www.GeneWeaver.org) powered by the Ontological Discovery Environment is a curated repository of genomic experimental results with an accompanying tool set for dynamic integration of these data sets, enabling users to interactively address questions about sets of biological functions and their relations to sets of genes. Thus, large numbers of independently published genomic results can be organized into new conceptual frameworks driven by the underlying, inferred biological relationships rather than a pre-existing semantic framework. An empirical 'ontology' is discovered from the aggregate of experimental knowledge around user-defined areas of biological inquiry."

BACKGROUND Integrating and analyzing heterogeneous genome-scale data is a huge algorithmic challenge for modern systems biology. Bipartite graphs can be useful for representing relationships across pairs of disparate data types, with the interpretation of these relationships accomplished through an enumeration of maximal bicliques. Most previously-known techniques are generally ill-suited to this foundational task, because they are relatively inefficient and without effective scaling. In this paper, a powerful new algorithm is described that produces all maximal bicliques in a bipartite graph. Unlike most previous approaches, the new method neither places undue restrictions on its input nor inflates the problem size. Efficiency is achieved through an innovative exploitation of bipartite graph structure, and through computational reductions that rapidly eliminate non-maximal candidates from the search space. An iterative selection of vertices for consideration based on non-decreasing common neighborhood sizes boosts efficiency and leads to more balanced recursion trees. RESULTS The new technique is implemented and compared to previously published approaches from graph theory and data mining. Formal time and space bounds are derived. Experiments are performed on both random graphs and graphs constructed from functional genomics data. It is shown that the new method substantially outperforms the best previous alternatives. CONCLUSIONS The new method is streamlined, efficient, and particularly well-suited to the study of huge and diverse biological data. A robust implementation has been incorporated into GeneWeaver, an online tool for integrating and analyzing functional genomics experiments, available at http://geneweaver.org. The enormous increase in scalability it provides empowers users to study complex and previously unassailable gene-set associations between genes and their biological functions in a hierarchical fashion and on a genome-wide scale. This practical computational resource is adaptable to almost any applications environment in which bipartite graphs can be used to model relationships between pairs of heterogeneous entities."

Using the Pathway Commons database we demonstrate the ability to rapidly identify shared connected components among a diverse set of pathways. In addition, we illustrate how results from maximal bipartite discovery can be decomposed into hierarchical relationships, allowing shared pathway components to be mapped through various parent-child relationships to help visualization and discovery of emergent kernel driven relationships. Interrogating common relationships among biological networks and conventional GeneWeaver gene lists will increase functional specificity and reliability of the shared biological components.

Extensive genetic and genomic studies of the relationship between alcohol drinking preference and withdrawal severity have been performed using animal models. Data from multiple such publications and public data resources have been incorporated in the GeneWeaver database with >60,000 gene sets including 285 alcohol withdrawal and preference-related gene sets. Among these are evidence for positional candidates regulating these behaviors in overlapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapped in distinct mouse populations. Combinatorial integration of functional genomics experimental results revealed a single QTL positional candidate gene in one of the loci common to both preference and withdrawal. Functional validation studies in Ap3m2 knockout mice confirmed these relationships. Genetic validation involves confirming the existence of segregating polymorphisms that could account for the phenotypic effect. By exploiting recent advances in mouse genotyping, sequence, epigenetics, and phylogeny resources, we confirmed that Ap3m2 resides in an appropriately segregating genomic region. We have demonstrated genetic and alcohol-induced regulation of Ap3m2 expression. Although sequence analysis revealed no polymorphisms in the Ap3m2-coding region that could account for all phenotypic differences, there are several upstream SNPs that could. We have identified one of these to be an H3K4me3 site that exhibits strain differences in methylation. Thus, by making cross-species functional genomics readily computable we identified a common QTL candidate for two related bio-behavioral processes via functional evidence and demonstrate sufficiency of the genetic locus as a source of variation underlying two traits."

WHO released new guidelines in 2015 recommending PrEP for all populations at substantial risk of HIV infection. To prepare these guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of values and preferences among populations that might benefit from PrEP, women, heterosexual men, young women and adolescent girls, female sex workers, serodiscordant couples, transgender people and people who inject drugs, and among healthcare providers who may prescribe PrEP. A comprehensive search strategy reviewed three electronic databases of articles and HIV-related conference abstracts (January 1990-April 2015). Data abstraction used standardised forms to categorise by population groups and relevant themes. Of 3068 citations screened, 76 peer-reviewed articles and 28 conference abstracts were included. Geographic coverage was global. Most studies (N = 78) evaluated hypothetical use of PrEP, while 26 studies included individuals who actually took PrEP or placebo. Awareness of PrEP was low, but once participants were presented with information about PrEP, the majority said they would consider using it. Concerns about safety, side effects, cost and effectiveness were the most frequently cited barriers to use. There was little indication of risk compensation. Healthcare providers would consider prescribing PrEP, but need more information before doing so. Findings from a rapidly expanding evidence base suggest that the majority of populations most likely to benefit from PrEP feel positively towards it.

HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of one or more antiretroviral medications (in combination) to prevent HIV infection. The most commonly used PrEP medication (Truvada\u00ae , Gilead Sciences, Inc.) acts by inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. If someone who is using PrEP unknowingly becomes HIV infected (termed 'PrEP breakthrough infection'), there may be suppressed viral replication resulting in a virus level undetectable by the most sensitive HIV NAT. Failure to seroconvert and seroreversion (loss of previously detectable HIV antibodies) have also both been observed with 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation screening immunoassays, as well as Western blot assays. If such a person was tested in the course of donating blood, the results may therefore be difficult to interpret. The index of suspicion for possible PrEP 'interference' should be highest in the context of concomitant low-level positive or 'greyzone' reactivity on HIV NAT and serological tests, which is an unusual pattern in acutely HIV-infected blood donors. Another possibility is detectable HIV RNA with negative HIV serology (i.e. a potential 'NAT yield' case) but without subsequent HIV seroconversion (or disappearance of HIV RNA). Excluding antiretroviral therapy or PrEP use by the donor in such circumstances would be important. The current rarity of PrEP breakthrough infection indicates that any potential safety risk is likely very small. However, considering the increasing use of PrEP we feel it is prudent for those interpreting HIV donor screening test results to consider the potential for PrEP interference."

Women represent nearly 60% of adults infected with HIV and PrEP can be a female-controlled prevention method for women who are unable to negotiate condom use.

There are 11 ongoing trials of ARV-based prevention in different at risk populations across the world. The iPrex trial showed that daily use of oral TDF/FTC by MSM resulted in 44% reduction in the incidence of HIV. This led to publication of interim guidance by CDC to use of PrEP by health providers for MSM. Few other trials are Bangkok Tenofovir Study, Partners PrEP Study, FEM-PrEP study, and VOICE (MTN-003) study. Future trials are being formulated for intermittent PrEP (iPrEP) where drugs are taken before and after sex, \"stand-in dose\" iPrEP, vaginal or rectal PrEP, etc. There are various issues/concerns with PrEP such as ADRs and resistance to TDF/FTC, adherence to drugs, acceptability, sexual disinhibition, use of PrEP as first line of defense for HIV without other prevention strategies, and cost. The PrEP has a potential to address unmet need in public health if delivered as a part of comprehensive toolkit of prevention services, including risk-reduction, correct and consistent use of condoms, and diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections."

METHODS PWID were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and completed a behavioral interview for the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system in 2012. Participants reported on willingness to use PrEP and how it might affect their drug use and sexual behaviors. We reported RDS-weighted proportions and multivariable correlates of being willing to use PrEP. RESULTS Among 304 participants, 69% were male, and the majority was aged \u226550 and black. Only 13.4% had ever heard of using anti-HIV medication to prevent HIV; none had ever used PrEP or knew anyone who used it in the past year. Forty-seven percent were very likely and 24% were somewhat likely to take PrEP if it were available without cost; 13% agreed they would not need to sterilize/clean needles or use condoms if taking PrEP. Correlates of being very likely to use PrEP included being younger (<50years), sharing cookers, cotton or water in the past year, and believing they would no longer need to use clean needles. CONCLUSION Nearly half of PWID reported being very willing to use PrEP if it were available without cost.

However, there are concerns about the authenticity of medicines purchased online. We established an innovative service offering plasma tenofovir (TFV) and emcitrabine (FTC) therapeutic drug monitoring for people buying generic PrEP online, to ensure that drug concentrations in vivo were consistent with those of propriety brands and previously published data. METHODS TFV/FTC concentrations were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection. Evaluation of renal function and testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were also carried out, at baseline and every 3-6 months, with risk reduction advice. RESULTS A total of 293 individuals presented having purchased PrEP on the internet: 85% were white, 84% were taking daily PrEP, and 16% were event-driven. Most were on generic TFV disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC from Cipla Ltd. Median (range) TFV and FTC plasma concentrations were 104 (21-597) ng/mL and 140 (17-1876) ng/mL, respectively. All concentrations were above our established plasma TFV and FTC targets, based on previously published data. Renal function was normal in all evaluable individuals and no new cases of HIV, HBV or HCV infection were seen. CONCLUSIONS In a population at high risk of HIV acquisition, who cannot yet access PrEP on the NHS, concentrations of TFV and FTC in generic formulations purchased over the internet were similar to (or slightly higher than) those measured in phase I studies with the original formulation from Gilead (Truvada\u2122), which has demonstrated high levels of protection against HIV infection in previous PrEP clinical trials."

BACKGROUND The potential impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with overlapping and nonoverlapping antiretrovirals (ARVs) on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission and drug resistance is unknown. METHODS A detailed mathematical model was used to simulate the epidemiological impact of ART alone, PrEP alone, and combined ART + PrEP in South Africa. RESULTS ART alone initiated at a CD4 lymphocyte cell count <200 cells/\u00b5L (80% coverage and 96% effectiveness) prevents 20% of HIV infections over 10 years but increases drug resistance prevalence to 6.6%. PrEP alone (30% coverage and 75% effectiveness) also prevents 21% of infections but with lower resistance prevalence of 0.5%. The ratio of cumulative infections prevented to prevalent drug-resistant cases after 10 years is 7-fold higher for PrEP than for ART. Combined ART + PrEP with overlapping ARVs prevents 35% of infections but increases resistance prevalence to 8.2%, whereas ART + PrEP with nonoverlapping ARVs prevents slightly more infections (37%) and reduces resistance prevalence to 7.2%. CONCLUSIONS Combined ART + PrEP is likely to prevent more HIV infections than either strategy alone, but with higher prevalence of drug resistance. ART is predicted to contribute more to resistance than is PrEP. Optimizing both ART and PrEP effectiveness and delivery are the keys to preventing HIV transmission and drug resistance."

Demonstration projects and open-label extensions of placebo-controlled trials are ongoing and hope to contribute to our understanding of PrEP use and delivery outside the randomized controlled trial setting. Evidence is beginning to emerge from these open-label studies and will be critical for guiding PrEP scale-up. Outside of such studies, PrEP uptake has been slow and several client- and provider-related barriers are limiting uptake.

Although available anti-CMV therapies may be effective for the prevention of CMV, they are plagued by unacceptable toxicities that prohibit their use in the post-transplant period. Recently studied CMV-active agents, such as maribavir and brincidofovir, failed to reduce the incidence of CMV infection in HCT recipients.

Areas covered: In this review, we will evaluate this novel agent with a focus on letermovir mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics and metabolism, clinical efficacy, and safety and toxicities.

Letermovir is a human cytomegalovirus terminase inhibitor for cytomegalovirus infection prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Posaconazole (POS), a substrate of glucuronosyltransferase and P-glycoprotein, and voriconazole (VRC), a substrate of CYP2C9/19, are commonly administered to transplant recipients. Because coadministration of these azoles with letermovir is expected, the effect of letermovir on exposure to these antifungals was investigated. Two trials were conducted in healthy female subjects 18 to 55 years of age. In trial 1, single-dose POS 300 mg was administered alone, followed by a 7-day washout; then letermovir 480 mg once daily was given for 14 days with POS 300 mg coadministered on day 14. In trial 2, on day 1 VRC 400 mg was given every 12 hours; on days 2 and 3, VRC 200 mg was given every 12 hours, and on day 4 VRC 200 mg. On days 5 to 8, letermovir 480 mg was given once daily. Days 9 to 12 repeated days 1 to 4 coadministered with letermovir 480 mg once daily. In both trials, blood samples were collected for the assessment of the pharmacokinetic profiles of the antifungals, and safety was assessed. The geometric mean ratios (90%CIs) for POS+letermovir/POS area under the curve and peak concentration were 0.98 (0.83, 1.17) and 1.11 (0.95, 1.29), respectively. Voriconazole+letermovir/VRC area under the curve and peak concentration geometric mean ratios were 0.56 (0.51, 0.62) and 0.61 (0.53, 0.71), respectively. All treatments were generally well tolerated.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a common opportunistic infection after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). CMV surveillance-preemptive therapy is the current preferred approach for preventing CMV disease after HSCT. In contrast, antiviral prophylaxis is not commonly used due to myelosuppressive effects of valganciclovir. In this article, the role of the newly approved antiviral compound, letermovir, is reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS Letermovir inhibits CMV by interfering viral terminase complex. In a phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled clinical study that enrolled 495 CMV-seropositive HSCT recipients, the primary end point of clinically significant CMV infection was significantly reduced by letermovir prophylaxis. Letermovir was well tolerated without risk of myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Experimental in-vitro data suggest that letermovir may possess low genetic barrier to resistance. In prophylaxis trials, two breakthrough infections were reported due to selection of CMV UL56 V236M mutation. SUMMARY Letermovir is an important addition to the current strategies for CMV prevention after allogeneic HSCT. Its favourable efficacy and safety profile re-opens door for antiviral prophylaxis another first-line option, similar to CMV surveillance-preemptive therapy, for preventing CMV in allogeneic HSCT recipients."

Letermovir is a human cytomegalovirus (CMV) terminase inhibitor recently approved as prophylaxis in stem cell transplant recipients. In further studies of emerging drug resistance, a baseline laboratory CMV strain was serially propagated in cell culture under a combination of letermovir and ganciclovir. In eight experiments, UL56 terminase gene mutations were detected beginning at 10 passages and included novel amino acid substitutions V236A, L328V, and A365S in a region previously associated with letermovir resistance. Outside this region, the UL56 substitution C25F was detected at moderate drug concentrations in two experiments as either the first detected mutation or an addition to a preexisting V231L substitution. In all cases, mutation at UL56 codon 325 conferring absolute letermovir resistance eventually developed at a median of 20 passages. No UL97 kinase or UL54 DNA polymerase mutations relevant to ganciclovir resistance were detected until many passages after the first detection of the UL56 mutations. UL56 substitutions V236A, L328V, and A365S were shown to confer borderline or low-grade letermovir resistance, while C25F conferred a 5.4-fold increase in letermovir resistance (50% effective concentration [EC50]) by itself and a 46-fold increase in combination with V231L. The evolution of resistance mutations sooner in UL56 than in UL54 or UL97 is consistent with prior in vitro observations, and UL56 codon 25 is a genetic locus for letermovir resistance distinct from loci previously described."

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is responsible for life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals and can cause serious congenital malformations. Available antivirals target the viral polymerase but are subject to cross-resistance and toxicity. New antivirals targeting other replication steps and inducing fewer adverse effects are therefore needed. During HCMV replication, DNA maturation and packaging are performed by the terminase complex, which cleaves DNA to package the genome into the capsid. Identified in herpesviruses and bacteriophages, and with no counterpart in mammalian cells, these terminase proteins are ideal targets for highly specific antivirals. A new terminase inhibitor, letermovir, recently proved effective against HCMV in phase III clinical trials, but the mechanism of action is unclear. Letermovir has no significant activity against other herpesvirus or non-human CMV. This review focuses on the highly conserved mechanism of HCMV DNA-packaging and the potential of the terminase complex to serve as an antiviral target. We describe the intrinsic mechanism of DNA-packaging, highlighting the structure-function relationship of HCMV terminase complex components."

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in men.

Most prostate cancer patients who are initially responsive develop the most aggressive form of disease called castration-resistant prostate cancer. Second-generation NSAA receptor antagonists (enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide) are emerging as additional new options to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. The objective of this work was to review the literature on the bioanalytical methods for the quantification of first- and second-generation NSAA inhibitors in clinical (human plasma) and preclinical (mouse plasma, rat plasma, urine and tissue homogenates etc.) studies along with relevant case studies for some chosen drugs.

Apalutamide (ARN-509) is an antiandrogen that binds selectively to androgen receptors (AR) and does not show antagonist-to-agonist switch like bicalutamide. We compared the activity of ARN versus bicalutamide on prostate cancer cell lines. The 22Rv1, PC3, and DU145 cell lines were used to study the effect of ARN and bicalutamide on the expression cytoplasmic/nuclear kinetics of AR, AR-V7 variant, phosphorylated AR, as well as the levels of the AR downstream proteins prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2, under exposure to testosterone and/or hypoxia. The effects on autophagic flux (LC3A, p62, TFEB, LAMP2a, cathepsin D) and cell metabolism-related enzymes (hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1/2\u03b1, BNIP3, carbonic anhydrase 9, LDHA, PDH, PDH-kinase) were also studied. The 22Rv1 cell line responded to testosterone by increasing the nuclear entry of AR, AR-V7, and phosphorylated AR and by increasing the levels of prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2. This effect was strongly abrogated by ARN and to a clearly lower extent by bicalutamide at 10 \u03bcmol/l, both in normoxia and in hypoxia. ARN had a stronger antiproliferative effect than bicalutamide, which was prominent in the 22Rv1 hormone-responsive cell line, and completely repressed cell proliferation at a concentration of 100 \u03bcmol/l. No effect of testosterone or of antiandrogens on autophagy flux, hypoxia-related proteins, or metabolism enzyme levels was noted. The PC3 and DU145 cell lines showed poor expression of the proteins and were not responsive to testosterone. On the basis of in-vitro studies, evidence has been reported that ARN is more potent than bicalutamide in blocking the AR pathway in normoxia and in hypoxia. This reflects a more robust, dose-dependent, repressive effect on cell proliferation."

BACKGROUND Recent retrospective data suggest that neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy can improve the prognosis of high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Novel androgen receptor pathway inhibitors are nowadays available for treatment of metastatic PCa and these compounds are promising for early stage disease. Apalutamide is a pure androgen antagonist with a very high affinity with the androgen receptor. The combination of apalutamide with degarelix, an LHRH antagonist, could increase the efficacy compared to degarelix alone. OBJECTIVE The primary objective is to assess the difference in proportions of minimal residual disease at prostatectomy specimen between apalutamide + degarelix vs placebo + degarelix. Various secondary endpoints are assessed: variations of different biomarkers at the tumour level (tissue microarrays to evaluate DNA-PKs, PARP, AR and splice variants, PSMA, etc.), whole transcriptome sequencing, exome sequencing and clinical (PSA and testosterone kinetics, early biochemical recurrence free survival, quality of life, safety, etc.) and radiological endpoints. METHODS ARNEO is a single centre, phase II, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. The plan is to include at least 42 patients per each of the two study arms. Patients with intermediate/high-risk PCa and who are amenable for radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection can be included. After signing an informed consent, every patient will undergo a pelvic 68Ga -PSMA-11 PSMA PET/MR and receive degarelix at standard dosage and start assuming apalutamide/placebo (60 mg 4 tablets/day) for 12 weeks. Within thirty days from the last study medication intake the same imaging will be repeated. Every patient will undergo PSA and testosterone testing the day of randomization, before the first drug intake, and after the last dose. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumour samples will be collected and used for transcriptome analysis, exome sequencing and immunohistochemistry. DISCUSSION ARNEO will allow us to answer, first, whether the combined treatment can result in an increased proportion of patients with minimal residual disease. Secondly, It will enable the study of the molecular consequences at the level of the tumour. Thirdly, what the consequences are of new generation androgen receptor pathway inhibitors on 68Ga -PSMA-11 PET/MR. Finally, various clinical, safety and quality of life data will be collected.

BACKGROUND Apalutamide, a competitive inhibitor of the androgen receptor, is under development for the treatment of prostate cancer. We evaluated the efficacy of apalutamide in men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were at high risk for the development of metastasis. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial involving men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of 10 months or less. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive apalutamide (240 mg per day) or placebo. All the patients continued to receive androgen-deprivation therapy. The primary end point was metastasis-free survival, which was defined as the time from randomization to the first detection of distant metastasis on imaging or death. RESULTS A total of 1207 men underwent randomization (806 to the apalutamide group and 401 to the placebo group). In the planned primary analysis, which was performed after 378 events had occurred, median metastasis-free survival was 40.5 months in the apalutamide group as compared with 16.2 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for metastasis or death, 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.35; P<0.001). Time to symptomatic progression was significantly longer with apalutamide than with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.63; P<0.001). The rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial regimen was 10.6% in the apalutamide group and 7.0% in the placebo group. The following adverse events occurred at a higher rate with apalutamide than with placebo: rash (23.8% vs. 5.5%), hypothyroidism (8.1% vs. 2.0%), and fracture (11.7% vs. 6.5%).

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is still the cornerstone of initial treatment; however, the vast majority of patients develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Several studies with numerous androgen receptor (AR)-directed agents have emerged since the approval of abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide. One of these agents is apalutamide, which seems to be a promising AR antagonist for the treatment of CRPC.

Expert opinion: Apalutamide is an oral, investigational, AR antagonist that targets the AR ligand-binding domain and prevents AR nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcription of AR gene targets. It has shown favorable safety profile and therapeutic index in Phase I studies, good tolerance and efficacy in patients with high-risk CRPC in Phase II studies.

Phase I and II trial experience demonstrates the safety and tolerability of apalutamide, as well as its efficacy in effecting prostate-specific antigen response and radiographic-free survival in CRPC. US Food and Drug Administration approval in M0 CRPC was granted following positive results from the phase III SPARTAN study, where apalutamide demonstrated significant improvements in metastasis-free survival and time to symptomatic progression as compared to placebo."

Novel drugs, drug sequences and combinations have improved the outcome of prostate cancer in recent years. The latest approvals include abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide and apalutamide which target androgen receptor (AR) signaling, radium-223 dichloride for reduction of bone metastases, sipuleucel-T immunotherapy and taxane-based chemotherapy. Adding abiraterone acetate to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in order to achieve complete androgen blockade has proven highly beneficial for treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Also, ADT together with docetaxel treatment showed significant benefit in mHSPC. Ongoing clinical trials for different subgroups of prostate cancer patients include the evaluation of the second-generation AR antagonists enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide, of inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, of inhibitors of DNA damage response, of targeted alpha therapy and of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting approaches. Advanced clinical studies with immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown limited benefits in prostate cancer and more trials are needed to demonstrate efficacy. The identification of improved, personalized treatments will be much supported by the major progress recently made in the molecular characterization of early- and late-stage prostate cancer using &ldquo;omics&rdquo; technologies. This has already led to novel classifications of prostate tumors based on gene expression profiles and mutation status, and should greatly help in the choice of novel targeted therapies best tailored to the needs of patients."

BACKGROUND Apalutamide is a potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonist that targets the AR ligand-binding domain and prevents AR nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcription of AR gene targets. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the activity and safety of apalutamide in patients with high-risk nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a multicenter phase 2 study of nmCRPC patients with a high risk for progression (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] \u22658 ng/ml or PSA doubling time [PSA DT] \u226410 mo). INTERVENTION Patients received 240mg/d apalutamide while continuing on androgen-deprivation therapy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Primary end point was 12-wk PSA response (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria). Secondary end points included safety, time to PSA progression (TTPP), and metastasis-free survival (MFS). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS A total of 51 patients were enrolled; four patients with metastatic disease were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Patient characteristics included median age, 71 yr; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 (76%); Gleason score \u22647 (57%); median PSA 10.7 ng/ml; and PSA DT \u226410 mo (45%). At median follow-up of 28.0 mo, 18 patients (35%) remained in the study. Overall, 89% of patients had \u226550% PSA decline at 12 wk. Median TTPP was 24.0 mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.3 mo-not reached [NR]); median MFS was NR (95% CI, 33.4 mo-NR). Most of the patients discontinued study treatment (n=33) due to disease progression (n=11 [22%]) or adverse events (AEs) (n=9 [18%]). The most common AE was fatigue (any grade, n=31 [61%]) although grade \u22653 fatigue was uncommon (n=2 [4%]). These represent the first apalutamide nmCRPC patient clinical data. CONCLUSIONS In high-risk nmCRPC patients, apalutamide was safe with robust activity based on durable PSA responses and disease control. PATIENT SUMMARY Antitumor activity and the safety of apalutamide in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer support continued development in this setting.

A disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) is a member of the metalloproteinase superfamily and involved in the cleavage of ectodomain of many transmembrane proteins. ADAM17 is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, which is associated with tumor development and progression. In the present study, we sought to investigate the expression and function of ADAM17 in hypoxia-treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression of ADAM17 in HCC cell lines (Hep3B and HepG2 cells). Annexin V/PI double staining was performed to analyze the effects of ADAM17 on hypoxia-mediated cisplatin resistance. ADAM17 expression was upregulated by hypoxia treatment in HCC cells at both mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of ADAM17 reduced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in HCC cells, accompanies by less cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Forced expression of ADAM17 enhanced the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Akt without affecting the expression of total EGFR and Akt. Pretreatment with EGFR inhibitor AG1478 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 rescued ADAM17-mediated cisplatin resistance of HCC cells. ADAM17 silencing attenuated hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance and enhanced the accumulation of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP. Western blot analysis showed that overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), a transcription factor, upregulated the expression of ADAM17 and HIF-1\u03b1 silencing downregulated the expression of ADAM17 in hypoxia-treated HCC cells, indicating the regulation of ADAM17 by HIF-1\u03b1. Taken together, our results indicated that ADAM17 is upregulated by hypoxia and contributes to hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance via EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway."

Natural killer (NK) cells recognize targets that have been changed via malignant transformation or infection. Previously, NK cells were thought to be short-lived, but we now know that NK cells can be long-lived and remember past exposures in response to CMV. NK cells use a plethora of activating and inhibitory receptors to recognize these changes and attack targets, but tumour cells often evade NK cells. Therefore, major efforts are being made to hone in on NK cell antitumour properties in immunotherapy. In the clinical setting, haploidentical NK cells can be adoptively transferred to help treat cancer. To expand NK cells in vivo and enhance tumour targeting, IL-15 is being tested in combination with a glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 inhibitor (CHIR99021), an inhibitor that has been shown to expand mature, highly functional NK cells capable of killing multiple tumour targets. One major limitation to NK cell therapy is lack of specificity. To address this concern, bispecific or trispecific engagers that target NK cells to the tumour and an ADAM17 inhibitor that prevents CD16 shedding after NK cell activation are being tested. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies are being designed to redirect the inhibitory signals that limit NK cell functionality. Further understanding of the biology of NK cells will inform strategies to exploit NK cells for therapeutic purposes."

Both CD16 isoforms undergo a rapid down-regulation in expression by ADAM17-mediated proteolytic cleavage upon cell activation by various stimuli. We examined soluble CD16 released from activated NK cells and neutrophils by mass spectrometric analysis, and identified three separate cleavage sites in close proximity at P1/P1' positions alanine195/valine196, valine196/serine197, and threonine198/isoleucine199, revealing a membrane proximal cleavage region in CD16. Substitution of the serine at position 197 in the middle of the cleavage region for a proline (S197P) effectively blocked CD16a and CD16b cleavage in cell-based assays. We also show that CD16a/S197P was resistant to cleavage when expressed in the human NK cell line NK92 and primary NK cells derived from genetically-engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells. CD16a is a potent activating receptor and despite blocking CD16a shedding, the S197P mutation did not disrupt IgG binding by the receptor or its activation of NK92 cells by antibody-treated tumor cells. Our findings provide further characterization of CD16 cleavage by ADAM17 and they demonstrate that a non-cleavable version of CD16a can be expressed in engineered NK cells."

Here we demonstrate that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17), a main sheddase for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, is essential for defensive epithelial properties against UC by promoting epithelial cell growth and goblet cell differentiation in mouse and human. Mice with systemic deletion of Adam17 developed severe dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis when compared to mice with myeloid cell Adam17 deletion or control littermates. ADAM17 was predominantly expressed by regenerating epithelia in control mice, and its loss or inhibition attenuated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, epithelial proliferation, mucus production and barrier functions. Conversely, ectopic EGFR stimulation promoted epithelial regeneration thereby partially rescuing the severe colitis caused by ADAM17 deficiency. In UC patients, epithelial ADAM17 expression positively correlated with both cell proliferation and goblet cell number. These findings suggest that maintaining ADAM17-EGFR epithelial signaling is necessary for the recovery from UC and would be beneficial to therapeutic strategies targeting ADAM17-mediated TNF-\u03b1 shedding."

ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17, also referred to as TNF\u03b1 converting enzyme or TACE) is a cell-surface metalloproteinase that regulates signaling via the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and has important roles in diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. ADAM17 can be activated by stimulation of several tyrosine kinase receptors, raising questions about whether oncogenic tyrosine kinases could also enhance EGFR signaling and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) via stimulation of ADAM17. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the role of Src in activating ADAM17. We provide evidence that a constitutively active transforming form of Src, the E378G mutant, as well as v-Src enhance ADAM17-mediated shedding of the EGFR ligand TGF\u03b1. Moreover, we demonstrate that constitutive shedding of TGF\u03b1 can be reduced by inhibition of Src in several cell lines, including COS7, MCF7 (the human breast cancer cell line), PAE (a pig aortic endothelial cell line) and HaCaT (the human keratinocyte cell line) cells. Src(E378G)-stimulated shedding of TGF\u03b1 is abolished in Adam17(-/-) cells, but can be rescued by wild-type (wt) ADAM17 and a mutant ADAM17 lacking its cytoplasmic domain. These findings demonstrate that ADAM17 is the principal TGF\u03b1 sheddase that is activated by Src in a manner that does not require the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17. Finally, we show that stimulation of ADAM17 by Src(E378G) leads to enhanced paracrine signaling via release of EGFR ligands into the culture supernatant. These results raise the possibility that activation of ADAM17 by oncogenic forms of Src can aid in promoting tumorigenesis by enhancing signaling via the EGFR and ERK in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Enhanced autocrine signaling could further activate tumor cells expressing oncogenic mutants of Src, whereas paracrine signaling could stimulate EGFR and ERK signaling in surrounding non-transformed cells such as stromal cells, thereby contributing to crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells."

Unlike other NK cell activating receptors, the cell surface density of CD16A can be rapidly downregulated in a cis manner by the metalloproteinase ADAM17 following NK cell stimulation in various manners. CD16A downregulation takes place in cancer patients and this may affect the efficacy of tumor-targeting mAbs. We examined the effects of MEDI3622, a human mAb and potent ADAM17 inhibitor, on NK cell activation by antibody-bound tumor cells. MEDI3622 effectively blocked ADAM17 function in NK cells and caused a marked increase in their production of IFN\u03b3. This was observed for NK cells exposed to different tumor cell lines and therapeutic antibodies, and over a range of effector/target ratios. The augmented release of IFN\u03b3 by NK cells was reversed by a function-blocking CD16A mAb. In addition, NK92 cells, a human NK cell line that lacks endogenous Fc\u03b3Rs, expressing a recombinant non-cleavable version of CD16A released significantly higher levels of IFN\u03b3 than NK92 cells expressing equivalent levels of wildtype CD16A. Taken together, our data show that MEDI3622 enhances the release of IFN\u03b3 by NK cells engaging antibody-bound tumor cells by blocking the shedding of CD16A. These findings support ADAM17 as a dynamic inhibitory checkpoint of the potent activating receptor CD16A, which can be targeted by MEDI3622 to potentially increase the efficacy of anti-tumor therapeutic antibodies."

Migraine is a common neurological disease characterised by the presence of attacks of unilateral, severe head pain accompanied by other symptoms. Although it has been classified as the sixth most disabling disorder, the available therapeutic options to treat this condition have not progressed accordingly. The advance in the development of 5-HT1 receptor agonists for migraine, including 5-HT1B/D and 5-HT1F receptor agonists, has meant a major step forward towards the progression of a better treatment for migraine. Triptans have a limited efficacy, and their effect on vasoconstriction makes them unsafe for patients with cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, novel effective antimigraine treatments without cardiovascular effects are required, such as selective 5-HT1F receptor agonists (ditans). Lasmiditan has much higher affinity for the 5-HT1F receptor than for the vasoconstrictor 5-HT1B receptor. This has been confirmed in preclinical studies performed to date, where lasmiditan showed no effect on vasoconstriction, and in clinical trials, where healthy individuals and patients did not report cardiac events due to treatment with lasmiditan, although it should be confirmed in larger cohorts. Lasmiditan crosses the blood-brain barrier and may act both centrally and peripherally on 5-HT1F receptors expressed on trigeminal neurons. It is a well-tolerated compound that does not induce major adverse events. Although ongoing phase III clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety, lasmiditan might offer an alternative to treat acute migraine with no associated cardiovascular risk. This review will focus on the characterisation of 5-HT1 receptor agonists and their effects as migraine therapies."

Migraine is a neurovascular disorder that involves activation of the trigeminovascular system and cranial vasodilation mediated by release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The gold standard for acute migraine treatment are the triptans, 5-HT1B/1D/(1F) receptor agonists. Their actions are thought to be mediated through activation of: (i) 5-HT1B receptors in cranial blood vessels with subsequent cranial vasoconstriction; (ii) prejunctional 5-HT1D receptors on trigeminal fibers that inhibit trigeminal CGRP release; and (iii) 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptors in central nervous system involved in (anti)nociceptive modulation. Unfortunately, coronary arteries also express 5-HT1B receptors whose activation would produce coronary vasoconstriction; hence, triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease. In addition, since migraineurs have an increased cardiovascular risk, it is important to develop antimigraine drugs devoid of vascular (side) effects. Ditans, here defined as selective 5-HT1F receptor agonists, were developed on the basis that most of the triptans activate trigeminal 5-HT1F receptors, which may explain part of the triptans' antimigraine action. Amongst the ditans, lasmiditan: (i) fails to constrict human coronary arteries; and (ii) is effective for the acute treatment of migraine in preliminary Phase III clinical trials. Admittedly, the exact site of action is still unknown, but lasmiditan possess a high lipophilicity, which suggests a direct action on the central descending antinociceptive pathways. Furthermore, since 5-HT1F receptors are located on trigeminal fibers, they could modulate CGRP release. This review will be particularly focussed on the similarities and differences between the triptans and the ditans, their proposed sites of action, side effects and their cardiovascular risk profile."

Lasmiditan is a novel selective 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist. It is both scientifically and clinically relevant to review whether a 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist is effective in the acute treatment of migraine. Two RCTs in the phase II development of lasmiditan was reviewed. In the intravenous placebo-controlled RCT, lasmiditan doses of 2.5-45 mg were used, and there was a linear association between headache relief (HR) rates and dose levels (P < 0.02). For lasmiditan 20 mg, HR was 64 % and for placebo it was 45 % (NS). In the oral placebo-controlled RCT, lasmiditan doses of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg were used. For HR, all doses of lasmiditan were superior to placebo (P < 0.05). For lasmiditan 400 mg, HR was 64 % and it was 25 % for placebo. Adverse events (AEs) emerging from the treatment were reported by 22 % of the patients receiving placebo and by 65, 73, 87 and 87 % of patients receiving 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg, respectively. The majority of AEs after lasmiditan 100 and 400 mg were moderate or severe. For the understanding of migraine pathophysiology, it is very important to note that a selective 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist like lasmiditan is effective in the acute treatment of migraine. Thus, migraine can be treated with a drug that has no vasoconstrictor ability. While lasmiditan most likely is effective in the treatment of migraine attacks it had, unfortunately, a high incidence of CNS related AEs in the oral RCT. If confirmed in larger studies in phase III, this might adversely limit the use of this highly specific non-vascular acute treatment of migraine. Larger studies including the parameters of patients' preferences are necessary to accurately position this new treatment principle in relation to the triptans."

BACKGROUND Lasmiditan (COL-144) is a novel, centrally acting, highly selective 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist without vasoconstrictor activity that seemed effective when given as an intravenous infusion in a proof-of-concept migraine study. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral lasmiditan for the acute treatment of migraine. METHODS In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-ranging study in 43 headache centres in five European countries, patients with migraine with and without aura and who were not using prophylaxis were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to treat one moderate or severe attack at home with 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg lasmiditan, or placebo. Study drug and placebo were supplied in identical numbered tablet packs. The randomisation code was generated by an independent statistician. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was dose response for headache relief (moderate or severe becoming mild or none) at 2 h. The primary analysis was done in the modified intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00883051. FINDINGS Between July 8 2009, and Feb 18, 2010, 512 patients were randomly assigned to treatment, 391 of whom received treatment. 86 patients received placebo (81 included in primary analysis) and 305 received lasmiditan (50 mg n=79, 100 mg n=81, 200 mg n=69, and 400 mg n=68 included in primary analysis). There was a linear association between headache response rate at 2 h and lasmiditan dose (Cochran-Armitage test p<0\u00b70001). Every lasmiditan treatment dose significantly improved headache response at 2 h compared with placebo (lasmiditan 50 mg: difference 17\u00b79%, 95% CI 3\u00b79-32\u00b71, p=0\u00b7022; 100 mg: 38\u00b72%, 24\u00b71-52\u00b74, p<0\u00b70001; 200 mg: 28\u00b78%, 9\u00b76-39\u00b79, p=0\u00b70018; 400 mg: 38\u00b77%, 23\u00b79-53\u00b76, p<0\u00b70001). The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events increased with increasing doses (53/82 [65%], 59/82 [72%], 61/71 [86%], and 59/70 [84%] for lasmiditan 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg, respectively vs 19/86 [22%] for placebo). Most adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity, with 16 of 82 (20%), 23 of 82 (28%), 28 of 71 (39%), and 31 of 70 (44%) of patients on lasmiditan 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg, respectively reporting a severe adverse event compared with five of 86 (6%) on placebo. The most common adverse events were CNS related and included dizziness, fatigue, vertigo, paraesthesia, and somnolence. INTERPRETATION Oral lasmiditan seems to be safe and effective in the acute treatment of migraine. Further assessment in larger placebo-controlled and triptan-controlled trials are needed to assess the potential role of lasmiditan in acute migraine therapy. FUNDING CoLucid Pharmaceuticals."

OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and safety of lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine. METHODS Adult patients with migraine were randomized (1:1:1) to a double-blind dose of oral lasmiditan 200 mg, lasmiditan 100 mg, or placebo and were asked to treat their next migraine attack within 4 hours of onset. Over 48 hours after dosing, patients used an electronic diary to record headache pain and the presence of nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia, one of which was designated their most bothersome symptom (MBS). RESULTS Of the 1,856 patients who treated an attack, 77.9% had \u22651 cardiovascular risk factors in addition to migraine. Compared with placebo, more patients dosed with lasmiditan 200 mg were free of headache pain at 2 hours after dosing (32.2% vs 15.3%; odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-3.6, p< 0.001), similar to those dosed with lasmiditan 100 mg (28.2%; OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.0, p< 0.001). Furthermore, compared with those dosed with placebo, more patients dosed with lasmiditan 200 mg (40.7% vs 29.5%; OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.1, p< 0.001) and lasmiditan 100 mg (40.9%; OR 1.7, 95% CI, 1.3-2.2, p< 0.001) were free of their MBS at 2 hours after dosing. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. CONCLUSIONS Lasmiditan dosed at 200 and 100 mg was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of acute migraine among patients with a high level of cardiovascular risk factors.

Migraine is an important socioeconomic burden and is ranked the sixth cause of years of life lost because of disability in the general population and the third cause of years of life lost in people younger than 50 years. The cornerstone of pharmacological treatment is represented by the acute therapy. The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptor subtype 1B/1D agonists, called triptans, are nowadays the first-line acute therapy for patients who experience moderate-to-severe migraine attacks. Unfortunately, a high percentage of patients are not satisfied with this acute treatment, either for lack of response or side effects. Moreover, their mechanism of action based on vasoconstriction makes them unsuitable for patients with previous cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases and for those with uncontrolled hypertension. Since the introduction of triptans, no other acute drug class has passed all developmental stages. The research for a new drug lacking vasoconstrictive effects led to the development of lasmiditan, a highly selective 5-HT1F receptor agonist with minimized interactions with other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Lasmiditan is considered to be the first member of a new drug category, the neurally acting anti-migraine agent (NAAMA). Phase II and III trials had shown superiority compared to placebo and absence of typical triptan-associated adverse events (AEs). Most of the AEs were related to the central nervous system, depending on the high permeability through the blood-brain barrier and mild to moderate severity. The results of ongoing long-term Phase III trials will determine whether lasmiditan will become available in the market, and then active triptan comparator studies will assess patients' preference. Future studies could then explore the safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding or the risk that overuse of lasmiditan leads to medication overuse headache."

INTRODUCTION Lasmiditan (COL-144; LY573144) is a novel, highly selective and potent agonist at 5-HT(1F) receptors that lacks vasoconstrictor activity. Preclinical and early clinical experiments predict acute antimigraine efficacy of COL-144 that is mediated through a non-vascular, primarily neural, mechanism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In a randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, group-sequential, adaptive treatment-assignment, proof-of-concept and dose-finding study, we treated 130 subjects in-hospital during a migraine attack. Subjects were allocated to an intravenous dose level of lasmiditan or placebo in small cohorts. The starting dose was 2.5 mg. Subsequent doses were adjusted, up or down, according to the safety and efficacy seen in the preceding cohort. The primary outcome measure was headache response defined as improvement from moderate or severe headache at baseline to mild or no headache at 2 h post-dose. The study was designed to explore the overall dose response relationship but was not powered to differentiate individual doses from placebo, nor to detect effect differences for other migraine symptoms. RESULTS Forty-two subjects received placebo and 88 received lasmiditan in doses of 2.5-45 mg. Subjects were observed in the clinic for 4 h after treatment and used a diary card to record symptoms and adverse events for up to 24 h. The study was terminated when the 20 mg dose met predefined efficacy stopping rules. Of subjects treated in the 10, 20, 30 and 45 mg lasmiditan dose groups, 54-75% showed a 2 h headache response, compared to 45% in the placebo group (P = 0.0126 for the linear association between response rates and dose levels). Patient global impression at 2 h and lack of need for rescue medication also showed statistically significant linear correlations with dose. Lasmiditan was generally well tolerated. Adverse events were reported by 65% of subjects on lasmiditan and by 43% on placebo and were generally mild. Dizziness, paresthesia and sensations of heaviness (usually limb) were more common on lasmiditan. CONCLUSIONS At intravenous doses of 20 mg and higher, lasmiditan proved effective in the acute treatment of migraine. Further studies to assess the optimal oral dose and full efficacy and tolerability profile are under way. The non-vascular, neural mechanism of action of lasmiditan may offer an alternative means to treat migraine especially in patients who have contra-indications for agents with vasoconstrictor activity. The clinicaltrials.gov identifier for this study is NCT00384774."

Research has focused on serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptors to develop drugs acting through non-vasoconstrictive mechanisms for treating acute migraine and those targeting 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 receptors for preventing migraine. Areas covered: This paper reviews antimigraine drugs targeting 5-HT receptors in one phase I trial (sumatriptan iontophoretic transdermal system, TDS) and five phase II clinical trials (PNU-142633, LY334370, lasmiditan, NOX-188). Expert opinion: Data from our overview on investigational drugs in phase I and II clinical trials using the 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist (sumatriptan TDS), 5-HT1D receptor agonist (PNU-142633), 5-HT1F receptor agonists (LY334370, lasmiditan) and a combined 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist with nNOS inhibition (NOX-188) provided encouraging data for sumatriptan TDS and lasmiditan, disappointing results for PNU-142633, and promising findings for NOX-188. The 5-HT1F receptor agonist lasmiditan, a drug acting through non-vasoconstrictive mechanisms, represents a promising safe, effective and tolerated acute migraine therapy also for patients at cardiovascular risk. Upcoming phase III trials should clarify the optimal lasmiditan dose and eventual clinical advantages over triptans. The negative results for the PNU-142633 trial prompt further studies using specific compounds more precisely targeting 5-HT1D receptors. Antagonism at 5-HT2B and 5-TH7 receptors, a promising strategy to prevent migraine, is still limited to experimental migraine models."

Therapeutic management of migraine relies mainly on non-specific medical treatment and is affected by low patient adherence to the treatment regimens applied. The introduction of specific anti-migraine treatment occurred over 20 years ago when the first triptan was approved by regulatory authorities (sumatriptan, 28 December 1992). Triptan use is limited by side effects, time- and frequency-restricted application, and the risk of developing medication overuse headache. Within the past few years, new and promising drugs such as more specific 5-HT 1F receptor agonists (that is, lasmiditan) and monoclonal calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antibodies entered advanced development phases while non-invasive neuromodulatory approaches were suggested to be potentially effective as non-pharmaceutical interventions for migraine."

Potocki-Shaffer syndrome (PSS) is a rare disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of genes located on the proximal short arm of chromosome 11 (11p11.2p12). Classic features include biparietal foramina, multiple exostoses, profound hypotonia, dysmorphic features, and developmental delay/intellectual disability. Fewer than 40 individuals with PSS have been reported, with variable clinical presentations due in part to disparity in deletion sizes. We report on a boy who presented for initial evaluation at age 13 months because of a history of developmental delay, hypotonia, subtle dysmorphic features, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. SNP microarray analysis identified a 137 kb deletion at 11p11.2, which maps within the classically defined PSS interval. This deletion results in haploinsufficiency for all or portions of six OMIM genes: SLC35C1, CRY2, MAPK8IP1, PEX16, GYLTL1B, and PHF21A. Recently, translocations interrupting PHF21A have been associated with intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies similar to those seen in PSS. The identification of this small deletion in a child with developmental delay and hypotonia provides further evidence for the genetic basis of developmental disability and identifies a critical region sufficient to cause hypotonia in this syndrome. Additionally, this case illustrates the utility of high resolution genomic approaches in correlating clinical phenotypes with specific genes in contiguous gene deletion syndromes."

The clinical features of PSS can include developmental delay, mental retardation, multiple exostoses, parietal foramina, enlarged anterior fontanel, minor craniofacial anomalies, ophthalmologic anomalies, and genital abnormalities in males. We constructed a natural panel of 11p11.2-p13 deletions using cell lines from 10 affected individuals, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), microsatellite analyses, and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). We then compared the deletion sizes and clinical features between affected individuals.

Yet one subject with parietal foramina whose deletion does not include ALX4 indicates that ALX4 in this subject may be rendered functionally haploinsufficient by a position effect. Based on comparative deletion mapping of eight individuals with the full PSS syndrome including mental retardation and two PSS families with no mental retardation, at least one gene related to mental retardation is likely located between D11S554 and D11S1385/D11S1319, 45.6-46.7 Mb from the 11p terminus."

Potocki-Shaffer Syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome associated with microdeletion of a region of Chromosome 11p11.2. Genetic evidence has implicated haploinsufficiency of PHF21A, a gene that encodes a histone-binding protein, as the likely cause of intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities in Potocki-Shaffer Syndrome. However, the molecular consequences of reduced PHF21A expression remain elusive. In this study, we analyzed by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) two patient-derived cell lines with heterozygous loss of PHF21A compared to unaffected individuals and identified 1,885 genes that were commonly misregulated. The patient cells displayed down-regulation of key pathways relevant to learning and memory, including Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP)-signaling pathway genes. We found that PHF21A is required for full induction of a luciferase reporter carrying cAMP-responsive elements (CRE) following stimulation by the cAMP analog, forskolin. Finally, PHF21A-deficient patient-derived cells exhibited a delayed induction of immediate early genes following forskolin stimulation. These results suggest that an impaired response to cAMP signaling might be involved in the pathology of PHF21A deficiency.

We report a patient with multiple exostoses, biparietal foramina, and history of mild developmental delay. Cognitive and behavioral testing supported formal diagnoses of anxiety, verbal dyspraxia, articulation disorder, and coordination disorder, without intellectual disability. His facial features, though distinctive, were not typical of those observed in PSS. As the chromosomal deletion does not encompass PHF21A, this case lends further support that haploinsufficiency of PHF21A contributes to the intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities in PSS and that there are other genes in the region which likely contribute to the behavioral phenotype in this syndrome. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

This microdeletion contains the least number of genes at 11p11.2 reported to date. Additionally, we also discuss the phenotypes observed in our patient with respect to those of published cases of microdeletions across the Potocki-Shaffer interval."

Potocki-Shaffer syndrome (PSS, OMIM #601224) is a rare contiguous gene deletion syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of genes located on the 11p11.2p12. Affected individuals have a number of characteristic features including multiple exostoses, biparietal foramina, abnormalities of genitourinary system, hypotonia, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. We report here on the first Korean case of an 8-yr-old boy with PSS diagnosed by high resolution microarray. Initial evaluation was done at age 6 months because of a history of developmental delay, hypotonia, and dysmorphic face. Coronal craniosynostosis and enlarged parietal foramina were found on skull radiographs. At age 6 yr, he had severe global developmental delay. Multiple exostoses of long bones were detected during a radiological check-up. Based on the clinical and radiological features, PSS was highly suspected. Subsequently, chromosomal microarray analysis identified an 8.6 Mb deletion at 11p11.2 [arr 11p12p11.2 (Chr11:39,204,770-47,791,278)\u00d71].

The exotoxins toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) are produced by the bacterial pathogen Clostridium difficile and are responsible for the pathology associated with C. difficile infection (CDI). The antitoxin antibodies actoxumab and bezlotoxumab bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. Bezlotoxumab was recently approved by the FDA for reducing the recurrence of CDI. We have previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain, preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization. Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques, we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189 and 2410-2437. Actoxumab binding caused the aggregation of TcdA especially at higher antibody:toxin concentration ratios. Actoxumab prevented the association of TcdA with target cells demonstrating that actoxumab neutralizes toxin activity by inhibiting the first step of the intoxication cascade. This mechanism of neutralization is similar to that observed with bezlotoxumab and TcdB. Comparisons of the putative TcdA epitope sequences across several C. difficile ribotypes and homologous repeat sequences within TcdA suggest a structural basis for observed differences in actoxumab binding and/or neutralization potency. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the protective effects of the antibody in vitro and in vivo, including in various preclinical models of CDI."

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common nosocomial infection in the U.S. 25% of CDI patients go on to develop recurrent CDI (rCDI) following current standard of care (SOC) therapy, leading to morbidity, mortality and economic loss. The first passive immunotherapy drug targeting C.difficile toxin B (bezlotoxumab) has been approved recently by the FDA and EMA for prevention of rCDI. Areas covered: A body of key studies was selected and reviewed by the authors. The unmet needs in CDI care were ascertained with emphasis in rCDI, including the epidemiology, pathophysiology and current management. The current knowledge about the immune response to C. difficile toxins and how this knowledge led to the development and the clinical use of bezlotoxumab is described. Current and potential future competitors to the drug were examined. Expert commentary: A single 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion of bezlotoxumab has been shown to decrease rCDI by ~40% (absolute reduction ~10%) in patients being treated for primary CDI or rCDI with SOC antibiotics. Targeting C.difficile toxins by passive immunotherapy is a novel mechanism for prevention of C.difficile infection. Bezlotoxumab will be a valuable adjunctive therapy to reduce the burden of CDI."

OBJECTIVE To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and place in therapy of bezlotoxumab (BEZ), a novel monoclonal antibody against Clostridium difficile toxin B. DATA SOURCES A PubMed search was conducted for data between 1946 and April 2017 using MeSH terms bezlotoxumab, MK-6072, or MDX-1388 alone and the terms Clostridium difficile combined with monoclonal antibody or antitoxin. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION The literature search was limited to English-language studies that described clinical efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics in humans and animals. Abstracts featuring prepublished data were also evaluated for inclusion. DATA SYNTHESIS BEZ is indicated for adult patients receiving standard-of-care (SoC) antibiotics for C difficile infection (CDI) to prevent future recurrence. Two phase III trials-MODIFY I (n = 1452) and MODIFY II (n = 1203)-demonstrated a 40% relative reduction in recurrent CDI (rCDI) with BEZ compared with placebo (16.5% vs 26.6%, P < 0.0001). The most common adverse drug events associated with BEZ were mild to moderate infusion-related reactions (10.3%). CONCLUSIONS In patients treated with SoC antibiotics, BEZ is effective in decreasing rCDI. BEZ has no apparent effect on treatment of an initial CDI episode. In light of increasing rates of CDI, BEZ is a promising option for preventing recurrent episodes. The greatest benefit has been demonstrated in high-risk patients, though the targeted patient population is yet to be defined."

Bezlotoxumab (Zinplava\u2122) is a fully human monoclonal antibody against Clostridium difficile toxin B indicated for the prevention of C. difficile infection (CDI) recurrence in patients with a high recurrence risk. It is the first agent approved for recurrence prevention and is administered as a single intravenous infusion in conjunction with standard-of-care (SoC) antibacterial treatment for CDI. In well-designed, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials (MODIFY 1 and 2), a single infusion of bezlotoxumab, given in combination with SoC antibacterial therapy for CDI in adults, was effective in reducing CDI recurrence in the 12 weeks post-treatment, with this benefit being seen mainly in the patients at high recurrence risk. Bezlotoxumab did not impact the efficacy of the antibacterials being used to treat the CDI and, consistent with its benefits on CDI recurrence, appeared to reduce the need for subsequent antibacterials, thus minimizing further gut microbiota disruption. Longer term, there were no further CDI recurrences over 12 months' follow-up among patients who had received bezlotoxumab in MODIFY 2 and entered an extension substudy. Bezlotoxumab has low immunogenicity and is generally well tolerated, although the potential for heart failure in some patients requires consideration; cost-effectiveness data for bezlotoxumab are awaited with interest. Thus, a single intravenous infusion of bezlotoxumab during SoC antibacterial treatment for CDI is an emerging option for reducing CDI recurrence in adults at high risk of recurrence."

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) represents the most prevalent cause of antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal infections in health care facilities in the developed world. Disease symptoms are caused by the two homologous exotoxins, TcdA and TcdB. Standard therapy for CDI involves administration of antibiotics that are associated with a high rate of disease recurrence, highlighting the need for novel treatment paradigms that target the toxins rather than the organism itself. A combination of human monoclonal antibodies, actoxumab and bezlotoxumab, directed against TcdA and TcdB, respectively, has been shown to decrease the rate of recurrence in patients treated with standard-of-care antibiotics. However, the exact mechanism of antibody-mediated protection is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the antitoxin antibodies are protective in multiple murine models of CDI, including systemic and local (gut) toxin challenge models, as well as primary and recurrent models of infection in mice. Systemically administered actoxumab-bezlotoxumab prevents both the damage to the gut wall and the inflammatory response, which are associated with C. difficile in these models, including in mice challenged with a strain of the hypervirulent ribotype 027. Furthermore, mutant antibodies (N297Q) that do not bind to Fc\u03b3 receptors provide a level of protection similar to that of wild-type antibodies, demonstrating that the mechanism of protection is through direct neutralization of the toxins and does not involve host effector functions. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the prevention of recurrent disease observed in CDI patients in clinical trials."

Furthermore, patients with at least one CDI recurrence are at an increased risk of developing additional recurrences. A novel approach to the prevention of recurrent CDI is the use of monoclonal antibodies directed against the toxins responsible for CDI as an adjunct to antibiotic treatment. Bezlotoxumab, a human monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes C. difficile toxin B, is the first therapeutic agent to receive United States Food and Drug Administration approval for the prevention of CDI recurrence. Clinical studies have demonstrated superior efficacy of bezlotoxumab in adults receiving antibiotic therapy for CDI compared with antibiotic therapy alone for the prevention of CDI recurrence.

Antibiotics have significant and long-lasting impacts on the intestinal microbiota and consequently reduce colonization resistance against Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Standard therapy using antibiotics is associated with a high rate of disease recurrence, highlighting the need for novel treatment strategies that target toxins, the major virulence factors, rather than the organism itself. Human monoclonal antibodies MK-3415A (actoxumab-bezlotoxumab) to C. difficile toxin A and toxin B, as an emerging non-antibiotic approach, significantly reduced the recurrence of CDI in animal models and human clinical trials. Although the main mechanism of protection is through direct neutralization of the toxins, the impact of MK-3415A on gut microbiota and its restoration has not been examined. Using a CDI murine model, we compared the bacterial diversity of the gut microbiome of mice under different treatments including MK-3415A, vancomycin, or vancomycin combined with MK-3415A, sampled longitudinally. Here, we showed that C. difficile infection resulted in the prevalence of Enterobacter species. Sixty percent of mice in the vehicle group died after 2 days and their microbiome was almost exclusively formed by Enterobacter. MK-3415A treatment resulted in lower Enterobacter levels and restoration of Blautia, Akkermansia, and Lactobacillus which were the core components of the original microbiota. Vancomycin treatment led to significantly lower survival rate than the combo treatment of MK-3415A and vancomycin. Vancomycin treatment decreased bacterial diversity with predominant Enterobacter and Akkermansia, while Staphylococcus expanded after vancomycin treatment was terminated. In contrast, mice treated by vancomycin combined with MK-3415A also experienced decreased bacterial diversity during vancomycin treatment. However, these animals were able to recover their initial Blautia and Lactobacillus proportions, even though episodes of Staphylococcus overgrowth were detected by the end of the experiments. In conclusion, MK-3415A (actoxumab-bezlotoxumab) treatment facilitates normalization of the gut microbiota in CDI mice. It remains to be examined whether or not the prevention of recurrent CDI by the antitoxin antibodies observed in clinical trials occurs through modulation of microbiota."

PURPOSE Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork (TM). The preclinical characterization of netarsudil, a new ROCK/norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibitor currently in clinical development, is presented herein. METHODS The kinase inhibitory activity of netarsudil was compared to its esterase metabolite, netarsudil-M1, and 3 other ROCK inhibitors using a commercially available kinase assay kit. Disruption of actin stress fibers was measured in primary porcine TM cells and disruption of focal adhesions in transformed human TM (HTM) cells. Induction of fibrosis markers after exposure to transforming growth factor-\u03b22 (TGF-\u03b22) was conducted in primary HTM cells. Ocular hypotensive activity and tolerability of topical formulations were evaluated in normotensive Dutch Belted rabbits and Formosan Rock monkeys. In vitro corneal metabolism assays were conducted using dog, pig, rabbit, monkey, and human corneas. In vivo ocular pharmacokinetics was studied in Dutch Belted rabbits. RESULTS Netarsudil inhibited kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 with a Ki of 1 nM each, disrupted actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in TM cells with IC50s of 79 and 16 nM, respectively, and blocked the profibrotic effects of TGF-\u03b22 in HTM cells. Netarsudil produced large reductions in IOP in rabbits and monkeys that were sustained for at least 24 h after once daily dosing, with transient, mild hyperemia observed as the only adverse effect. CONCLUSION Netarsudil is a novel ROCK/NET inhibitor with high potency in biochemical and cell-based assays, an ability to produce large and durable IOP reductions in animal models, and favorable pharmacokinetic and ocular tolerability profiles."

PURPOSE Netarsudil, an inhibitor of Rho kinase and a norepinephrine transporter, has been shown to lower elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in controlled studies of patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, and in healthy volunteers. The mechanism of this ocular hypotensive effect in humans is unknown. METHODS The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of netarsudil 0.02% on aqueous humor dynamics (AHD) parameters. In this double-masked, vehicle-controlled, paired-eye comparison study, 11 healthy volunteers received topical netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% or its vehicle once daily for 7 days (morning dosing). The primary endpoints were the change in AHD parameters, compared between active and vehicle-treated eyes. RESULTS In netarsudil-treated eyes, diurnal outflow facility increased from 0.27 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcL/min/mmHg to 0.33 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcL/min/mmHg (+22%; P = 0.02) after 7 days of treatment. In placebo-treated eyes, diurnal outflow facility did not significantly change (P = 0.94). The difference between netarsudil and placebo eyes in diurnal change of outflow facility was 0.08 \u03bcL/min/mmHg (P < 0.001). Diurnal episcleral venous pressure (EVP) in netarsudil-treated eyes decreased from 7.9 \u00b1 1.2 mmHg to 7.2 \u00b1 1.8 (-10%; P = 0.01). Diurnal EVP was not significantly different between netarsudil- and placebo-treated eyes. There was a trend toward decreasing aqueous humor flow rate (-15%; P = 0.08). No treatment changes were seen in uveoscleral outflow rate. CONCLUSIONS Once-daily dosing of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% lowered IOP through increasing trabecular outflow facility and reducing EVP.

In an elegant example of bench-to-bedside research, a hypothesis that cells in the outflow pathway actively regulate conventional outflow resistance was proposed in the 1990s and systematically pursued, exposing novel cellular and molecular mechanisms of intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation. The critical discovery that pharmacologic manipulation of the cytoskeleton of outflow pathway cells decreased outflow resistance placed a spotlight on the Rho kinase pathway that was known to regulate the cytoskeleton. Ultimately, a search for Rho kinase inhibitors led to the discovery of several molecules of therapeutic interest, leaving us today with 2 new ocular hypotensive agents approved for clinical use: ripasudil in Japan and netarsudil in the United States. These represent members of the first new class of clinically useful ocular hypotensive agents since the US Food and Drug Administration approval of latanoprost in 1996. The development of Rho kinase inhibitors as a class of medications to lower IOP in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension represents a triumph in translational research. Rho kinase inhibitors are effective alone or when combined with other known ocular hypotensive medications. They also offer the possibility of neuroprotective activity, a favorable impact on ocular blood flow, and even an antifibrotic effect that may prove useful in conventional glaucoma surgery. Local adverse effects, however, including conjunctival hyperemia, subconjunctival hemorrhages, and cornea verticillata, are common. Development of Rho kinase inhibitors targeted to the cells of the outflow pathway and the retina may allow these agents to have even greater clinical impact. The objectives of this review are to describe the basic science underlying the development of Rho kinase inhibitors as a therapy to lower IOP and to summarize the results of the clinical studies reported to date. The neuroprotective and vasoactive properties of Rho kinase inhibitors, as well as the antifibrotic properties, of these agents are reviewed in the context of their possible role in the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma."

Peripheral vision loss followed by \"tunnel vision\" and eventual irreversible blindness is the fate of patients afflicted by various forms of glaucoma including primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and normotensive glaucoma (NTG). These complex and heterogeneous diseases are characterized by extensive death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) accompanied by retraction and severance of their axonal connections to the brain and thus damage to and thinning of the optic nerve. Since patients suffering from this glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) first notice visual impairment when they have lost > 40% of their RGCs, early diagnosis is the key to retard the progression of glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), low cerebrospinal and/or low intracranial fluid pressure, advancing age, and ethnicity are major risk factors associated with POAG. However, retinal vascular abnormalities and a high sensitivity of RGCs and optic nerve head components to neurotoxic, inflammatory, oxidative and mechanical insults also contribute to vision loss in POAG/GON. Current treatment modalities for POAG and NTG involve lowering IOP using topical ocular drugs, combination drug products, and surgical interventions. Two recently approved multi-pharmacophoric drugs (e.g., rho kinase inhibitor, Netarsudil; a drug conjugate, Latanoprostene Bunod) and novel aqueous humor drainage devices (iStent and CyPass) are also gaining acceptance for treating POAG/ NTG. Neuroprotective and regenerative agents, coupled with electroceutical, mechanical support systems, stem cell transplantation and gene therapy are emerging therapeutics on the horizon to help combat GON. The latter techniques and approaches hope to rejuvenate RGCs and repair the optic nerve structures, thereby providing a gain of function of the visual system for the glaucoma patients."

However, these cells have the propensity to leave the blood stream and migrate into inflamed tissues. Eosinophilic inflammation is present in a significant proportion of patients with severe asthma. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects more than 315 million people worldwide, with 10% having severe uncontrolled disease. Although the majority of patients can be efficiently treated, severe asthmatics continue to be uncontrolled and are at risk of exacerbations and even death. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) plays a fundamental role in eosinophil differentiation, maturation, activation and inhibition of apoptosis. Therefore, targeting IL-5 is an appealing approach to the treatment of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Reslizumab, a humanized anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, binds with high affinity to amino acids 89-92 of IL-5 that are critical for binding to IL-5 receptor \u03b1. Two phase III studies have demonstrated that reslizumab administration in adult patients with severe asthma and eosinophilia (\u2265400 cells/\u03bcL) improved lung function, asthma control, and symptoms. Thus, the use of blood eosinophils as a baseline biomarker could help to select patients with severe uncontrolled asthma who are likely to achieve benefits in asthma control with reslizumab.

The starting point for this drug was the growing realization that eosinophils appeared to be associated with a severe form of asthma in which patients were subject to exacerbations of their condition that could not be adequately managed using inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids. Studies of the pathophysiology of eosinophils revealed that they produce many bioactive compounds that contribute to the pathophysiology of a number of diseases including asthma. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) in particular is an important factor in some forms of severe asthma. A rat antibody to IL-5 (39D10) was humanized producing the product now know as reslizumab. However, initial studies of this antibody in patients with asthma were unsuccessful. It was only when the importance of the eosinophilic asthma endotype was recognized that reslizumab was found to indeed reduce the severity and exacerbations of asthma in patients who were inadequately treated by inhaled and/ or oral corticosteroids. These studies have determined that reslizumab is a valuable drug for the management of such patients provided that they have an eosinophil count of > 400 cells/mcL.

RATIONALE Reslizumab is a humanized anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody used as add-on maintenance treatment for patients with uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma. OBJECTIVES To predict response and nonresponse to intravenous reslizumab at 52 weeks with an algorithm we developed based on clinical indicators from pivotal clinical trials. METHODS Patients aged 18 years and older who met Global Initiative for Asthma 4 or 5 criteria and received intravenous reslizumab (n = 321) in two trials ( www.clinicaltrials.gov identifiers, NCT01287039 and NCT01285323) were selected as the data source. A mathematical model was constructed that was based on change from baseline to 16 weeks in Asthma Control Questionnaire and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores and FEV1, and number of clinical asthma exacerbations during the year before enrollment and in the first 16 weeks of treatment, and these measures were evaluated for their ability to predict the outcome at 52 weeks: responder, nonresponder, or indeterminate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The algorithm predicted that 276 patients would be classified as responders; in 248 (89.9%), the prediction was correct. In comparison, 26 patients were predicted to be nonresponders; 50.0% of these predictions were correct. Nineteen patients were classified as indeterminate. The algorithm had 95.4-95.5% sensitivity and 40.6-54.1% specificity. Jackknife and cross-study validation confirmed the robustness of the algorithm. CONCLUSIONS Our algorithm enabled prediction at 16 weeks of treatment of the response to intravenous reslizumab treatment at 52 weeks, but it was not suitable for predicting nonresponse. A positive score at 16 weeks should encourage continued treatment, and a negative score should prompt close monitoring to determine whether discontinuation is warranted."

In three double-blind BREATH studies of up to 52 weeks' duration, adding intravenous reslizumab (3 mg/kg, once every 4 weeks) to the current asthma therapy of patients (aged 12-75 years) with eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids resulted in significant reductions in clinical asthma exacerbation frequency and significant improvements in lung function, asthma control and health-related quality of life relative to adding placebo. Pooled data from the two trials of 52 weeks' duration indicated similar benefits with reslizumab across various patient subgroups, including patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Reslizumab was generally well tolerated, with very few recipients experiencing severe or serious treatment-related adverse events. Moreover, in an open-label extension study, continued use of reslizumab for up to 2 years was associated with durable lung function benefit, without any new tolerability concerns.

Consequently, there is considerable interest in understanding, detecting, and inhibiting QS. N-acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) are used as extracellular QS signals by a variety of Gram-negative bacteria.

Here, we describe several commonly used approaches incorporating C. violaceum and A. tumefaciens that can be used to detect AHL and QS inhibitors. Due to the inherent low susceptibility of biofilm bacteria to antimicrobial agents, biofilm dispersion, whereby bacteria reenter the planktonic community, is another increasingly important area of research.

AIM This review intends to provide a brief overview regarding quorum sensing among bacteria in biofilms and also attempts to throw light on the new research focusing on interference with the quorum sensing. BACKGROUND Dental plaque is an example of microbial biofilm leading to periodontal disease and dental caries. Quorum sensing is widely employed by a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species to coordinate various activities in biofilms. Quorum-sensing-interfering compounds have either a positive or a negative effect on the expression of bacterial phenotypes regulated by quorum sensing. These studies of bacterial quorum sensing have also suggested several ideal targets for drug design which can be promising in preventive and therapeutic aspects of periodontal diseases and dental caries. RESULTS Studies have shown that periodontal disease and dental caries is caused by plaque biofilm bacteria. Quorum sensing is the means of communication between these bacteria to regulate a wide range of behavior patterns among them. The in vitro studies reviewed here have a vital role in opening up this field, because they reveal the basic machinery of cell--cell signaling in microbial communities. The signal machinery bacteria use to coordinate a variety of their activities is identified by these studies. Further, this review aims to discuss several natural and synthetic methods which were used for manipulating bacterial quorum sensing. CONCLUSION The future challenge lies in the ability of the dental research to develop additional mechanisms for interfering with bacterial quorum sensing which can be used as preventive and therapeutic tools for combating oral polymicrobial diseases.

Quorum sensing is a signaling mechanism through which bacteria modulate a number of cellular functions (genes), including sporulation, biofilm formation, bacteriocin production, virulence responses, as well as others. Quorum sensing is a mechanism of cell-to-cell communication and is mediated by extracellular chemical signals generated by the bacteria when specific cell densities are reached. When the concentration of the signal (and cell population) is sufficiently high, the target gene or genes are either activated or repressed. Quorum sensing increases the ability of the bacteria to have access to nutrients or to more favorable environmental niches and enhances bacterial defenses against eukaryotic hosts, competing bacteria, and environmental stresses. The physiological and clinical aspects of quorum sensing have received considerable attention and have been studied at the molecular level. Little is known, however, on the role of quorum sensing in food spoilage or in the growth and/or toxin production of pathogens present in food. A number of compounds have been isolated or synthesized that antagonize quorum sensors, and application of these antagonists may potentially be useful in inhibiting the growth or virulence mechanisms of bacteria in different environments, including food. It is important that food microbiologists have an awareness and an understanding of the mechanisms involved in bacterial quorum sensing, since strategies targeting quorum sensing may offer a means to control the growth of undesirable bacteria in foods."

The emergence of antibiotic resistance coupled with the lack of investment by pharmaceutical companies necessitates a new look at how we tackle bacterial infections. An intriguing tactic is the interruption of bacterial communication systems. This non-biocidal approach would circumvent the evolutionary pressure on bacteria to mutate and develop resistance. In many pathogenic microorganisms, communication systems, collectively termed quorum sensing (QS), have been observed to control a number of bacterial behaviours including expression of virulence factors and the development of biofilms. QS signalling molecules and their biomimetics, therefore, represent a rational target for the disruption of cooperative behaviour and thus the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. Herein we review recent developments towards the interference of Pseudomonas aeruginosa QS using signalling molecules and their mimetics."

BACKGROUND Quorum sensing or the bacterial information flow in an orchestrated manner is an essential feature of many pathogenic bacteria. Quorum quenching molecules (QQ) can inhibit the growth of such bacteria. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of plant extracts as quorum quenchers and monitor the recent patents. METHODS Many available reports and patents are on synthetic ligand molecules or even compounds isolated from cyanobacteria (Honaucin A) and other microorganisms inhibiting quorum sensing molecules. Molecules with Quorum quenching (QQ) ability isolated from plants could inhibit violacein and pyocyanin production in Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively. RESULTS Studies leading to patents are initiated in this comparatively new topic. Hydrolysable tannins such as vescalagin and castalagin isolated from Conocarpus erectus are reported to have anti- quorum sensing activity. The gene product of agr D in gram positive bacteria is modified by endopeptidase to thiolactone peptide which is equivalent to acyl homoserine lactone of gram negative bacteria. General pathways suggested for the quorum sensing inhibition by plant extracts focuses on such autoinducers. CONCLUSION Medicinal plants and plant extracts are the leading sources of quorum sensing inhibitors. Patents related to quorum sensing inhibitors are taking new leaps in medicine, especially applications relating to the addition of quorum sensing inhibitors on to the surface of implantable or indwelling devices that are helpful in eradicating the trouble of infection in health care industry."

The term 'quorum sensing' describes intercellular bacterial communication which regulates bacterial gene expression according to population cell density. Bacteria produce and secrete small molecules, named autoinducers, into the intercellular space. The concentration of these molecules increases as a function of population cell density. Once the concentration of the stimulatory threshold is reached, alteration in gene expression occurs. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria possess different types of quorum sensing systems. Canonical LuxI/R-type/acyl homoserine lactone mediated quorum sensing system is the best studied quorum sensing circuit and is described in Gram-negative bacteria which employ it for inter-species communication mostly. Gram-positive bacteria possess a peptide-mediated quorum sensing system. Bacteria can communicate within their own species (intra-species) but also between species (inter-species), for which they employ an autoinducer-2 quorum sensing system which is called the universal language of the bacteria. Periodontal pathogenic bacteria possess AI-2 quorum sensing systems. It is known that they use it for regulation of biofilm formation, iron uptake, stress response and virulence factor expression. A better understanding of bacterial communication mechanisms will allow the targeting of quorum sensing with quorum sensing inhibitors to prevent and control disease."

Quorum sensing is the phenomenon, whereby bacteria use signal molecules to communicate with each other. For example, to establish a successful infection, pathogenic bacteria become virulent only when they reach a certain local concentration in their host. Bassler and others have highlighted the surprising observation that quorum sensing seems to repress Vibrio cholerae virulence factor expression (e.g. cholera toxin), in contrast to what has been observed for virulence gene expression in other bacteria. Here, I present a novel insight that may clarify the way V. cholerae quorum-sensing signals regulate its genes. Chironomids (Diptera; Chironomidae), which occur worldwide and are frequently the insect found most abundantly in fresh water bodies, are natural reservoirs of V. cholerae. Quorum-sensing signals in V. cholerae up-regulate the production of an extracellular enzyme, haemagglutinin protease (HAP), which degrades chironomid egg masses and prevents the eggs from hatching. HAP, therefore, is a virulence factor against chironomids. Indeed, in a survey carried out over the course of a year, V. cholerae and chironomids showed a pattern that mirrored the dynamics of predator-prey populations. Globally, the numbers of chironomids are much larger than those of humans, so quorum-sensing signals of V. cholerae and HAP gene regulation should be understood with regard to their role in chironomids rather than humans. Further research is needed to understand the role of cholera toxin in the environmental existence of V. cholerae."

Bimagrumab (BYM338) is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody that exerts strong promyogenic effects on skeletal muscle by blocking activin type II receptors (ActRII). We investigated whether such blockade of ActRII by bimagrumab manifests any detrimental effect on outcomes of bone healing in a rat fibula osteotomy model. Animals (n = 150) were divided into 11 groups and received weekly treatment with either bimagrumab (10 or 100 mg/kg) or vehicle. Progression and outcomes of bone healing were assessed by lateral radiographs in vivo as well as by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), 4-point bending test, and microscopic examination of the excised fibula at Day 29 or later. The radiographic progression of bone healing showed no significant differences between treatment groups in any comparative setting. In 3-month-old animals, pQCT revealed slightly reduced immature callus size and bone mineral content in bimagrumab-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated animals at Day 29 (p < 0.05). There were, however, no differences in mature callus size, bone mineral density, or biomechanical competency. The aforementioned effects on immature callus size were not present when the treatment was initiated 4 weeks post osteotomy or when treating 6-month-old animals. In summary, these findings suggest that there is no major impact of ActRII blockade on overall fracture healing, and delayed treatment initiation can bypass the small and transient effect of the therapy on immature callus formation observed in younger animals. Verification of these findings in humans is the subject of an ongoing clinical trial on elderly hip fracture patients."

OBJECTIVE To study activin signaling and its blockade in sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) through translational studies and a randomized controlled trial. METHODS We measured transforming growth factor \u03b2 signaling by SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in muscle biopsies of 50 patients with neuromuscular disease (17 with sIBM). We tested inhibition of activin receptors IIA and IIB (ActRII) in 14 patients with sIBM using one dose of bimagrumab (n = 11) or placebo (n = 3). The primary outcome was the change in right thigh muscle volume by MRI at 8 weeks. Lean body mass, strength, and function were secondary outcomes. Twelve of the patients (10 bimagrumab, 2 placebo) participated in a subsequent 16-week observation phase. RESULTS Muscle SMAD2/3 phosphorylation was higher in sIBM than in other muscle diseases studied (p = 0.003). Eight weeks after dosing, the bimagrumab-treated patients increased thigh muscle volume (right leg +6.5% compared with placebo, p = 0.024; left leg +7.6%, p = 0.009) and lean body mass (+5.7% compared with placebo, p = 0.014). Subsequently, bimagrumab-treated patients had improved 6-minute walking distance, which peaked at 16 weeks (+14.6%, p = 0.008) compared with placebo. There were no serious adverse events; the main adverse events with bimagrumab were mild acne and transient involuntary muscle contractions. CONCLUSIONS Transforming growth factor \u03b2 superfamily signaling, at least through ActRII, is implicated in the pathophysiology of sIBM. Inhibition of ActRII increased muscle mass and function in this pilot trial, offering a potential novel treatment of sIBM. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with inclusion body myositis, bimagrumab increases thigh muscle volume at 8 weeks."

The myostatin/activin type II receptor (ActRII) pathway has been identified to be critical in regulating skeletal muscle size. Several other ligands, including GDF11 and the activins, signal through this pathway, suggesting that the ActRII receptors are major regulatory nodes in the regulation of muscle mass. We have developed a novel, human anti-ActRII antibody (bimagrumab, or BYM338) to prevent binding of ligands to the receptors and thus inhibit downstream signaling. BYM338 enhances differentiation of primary human skeletal myoblasts and counteracts the inhibition of differentiation induced by myostatin or activin A. BYM338 prevents myostatin- or activin A-induced atrophy through inhibition of Smad2/3 phosphorylation, thus sparing the myosin heavy chain from degradation. BYM338 dramatically increases skeletal muscle mass in mice, beyond sole inhibition of myostatin, detected by comparing the antibody with a myostatin inhibitor. A mouse version of the antibody induces enhanced muscle hypertrophy in myostatin mutant mice, further confirming a beneficial effect on muscle growth beyond myostatin inhibition alone through blockade of ActRII ligands. BYM338 protects muscles from glucocorticoid-induced atrophy and weakness via prevention of muscle and tetanic force losses. These data highlight the compelling therapeutic potential of BYM338 for the treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness in multiple settings."

Bimagrumab is a human anti-ActRII antibody which was found to increase muscle mass and function by blocking ActRII signaling. As it has considerable potential for being misused as doping agent in sports, the aim of this study was to develop a mass spectrometric detection assay for doping control serum samples. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Within this study, a detection method for Bimagrumab in human serum was developed, which combines ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity purification with proteolytic digestion and LC-HRMS. To facilitate the unambiguous identification of the diagnostic peptides, an orthogonal IM separation was additionally performed. RESULTS The assay was successfully validated and the analysis of clinical samples demonstrated its fitness for purpose for an application in routine doping control analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Although no myostatin inhibitors have obtained clinical approval yet, the proactive development of detection methods for emerging doping agents represents a key aspect of preventive doping research.

Simultaneous bone and muscle decay and dysfunction (osteosarcopenia or sarco-osteoporosis) is seen in ageing, numerous clinical situations including after stroke or paralysis, in neuromuscular dystrophies, glucocorticoid excess, or in association with vitamin D, growth hormone/insulin like growth factor or sex steroid deficiency, as well as in spaceflight. Physical exercise may be beneficial in these situations, but further work is still needed to translate acceptable and effective biomechanical interventions like vibration therapy from animal models to humans. Novel antiresorptive and anabolic therapies are emerging for osteoporosis as well as drugs for sarcopenia, cancer cachexia or muscle wasting disorders, including antibodies against myostatin or activin receptor type IIA and IIB (e.g. bimagrumab). Ideally, increasing muscle mass would increase muscle strength and restore bone loss from disuse. However, the classical view that muscle is unidirectionally dominant over bone via mechanical loading is overly simplistic. Indeed, recent studies indicate a role for neuronal regulation of not only muscle but also bone metabolism, bone signaling pathways like receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) implicated in muscle biology, myokines affecting bone and possible bone-to-muscle communication. Moreover, pharmacological strategies inducing isolated myocyte hypertrophy may not translate into increased muscle power because tendons, connective tissue, neurons and energy metabolism need to adapt as well. We aim here to critically review key musculoskeletal molecular pathways involved in mechanoregulation and their effect on the bone-muscle unit as a whole, as well as preclinical and emerging clinical evidence regarding the effects of sarcopenia therapies on osteoporosis and vice versa."

BACKGROUND Bimagrumab is a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of activin type II receptors (ActRII), with anabolic action on skeletal muscle mass by blocking binding of myostatin and other negative regulators of muscle growth. Bimagrumab is under evaluation for muscle wasting and associated functional loss in hip fracture and sarcopenia, and in obesity. Bimagrumab also blocks other endogenous ActRII ligands, such as activins, which act on the neurohormonal axes, pituitary, gonads and adrenal glands. AIM To evaluate the effect of bimagrumab on the pituitary-gonadal and pituitary-adrenal axes in humans. METHODS Healthy men and women, aged 55 to 75 years, received bimagrumab intravenously 10 mg/kg or placebo on Day 1 and Day 29. Pituitary-gonadal and pituitary-adrenal functions were evaluated with basal hormone measurement and standard gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests at baseline, Week 8 and at the end of study (EOS)-Week 20. RESULTS At Week 8, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were reduced by 42.16 IU/L (P < .001) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were increased by 2.5 IU/L (P = .08) over placebo in response to bimagrumab in women but not in men. Effects that were reversible after bimagrumab was cleared. Gonadal and adrenal androgen levels were not affected by exposure to bimagrumab. CONCLUSION Bimagrumab alters the function of pituitary gonadotroph cells, consistent with blockade of activin on local ActRII. This effect is reversible with clearance of bimagrumab.

BACKGROUND Cachexia affects the majority of patients with advanced cancer and is associated with reduced treatment tolerance, response to therapy, quality of life, and life expectancy. Cachectic patients with advanced cancer often receive anti-cancer therapies against their specific cancer type as a standard of care, and whether specific ActRII inhibition is efficacious when combined with anti-cancer agents has not been elucidated yet. METHODS In this study, we evaluated interactions between ActRII blockade and anti-cancer agents in CT-26 mouse colon cancer-induced cachexia model. CDD866 (murinized version of bimagrumab) is a neutralizing antibody against the activin receptor type II (ActRII) preventing binding of ligands such as myostatin and activin A, which are involved in cancer cachexia. CDD866 was evaluated in association with cisplatin as a standard cytotoxic agent or with everolimus, a molecular-targeted agent against mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In the early studies, the treatment effect on cachexia was investigated, and in the additional studies, the treatment effect on progression of cancer and the associated cachexia was evaluated using body weight loss or tumor volume as interruption criteria. RESULTS Cisplatin accelerated body weight loss and tended to exacerbate skeletal muscle loss in cachectic animals, likely due to some toxicity of this anti-cancer agent. Administration of CDD866 alone or in combination with cisplatin protected from skeletal muscle weight loss compared to animals receiving only cisplatin, corroborating that ActRII inhibition remains fully efficacious under cisplatin treatment. In contrast, everolimus treatment alone significantly protected the tumor-bearing mice against skeletal muscle weight loss caused by CT-26 tumor. CDD866 not only remains efficacious in the presence of everolimus but also showed a non-significant trend for an additive effect on reversing skeletal muscle weight loss. Importantly, both combination therapies slowed down time-to-progression. CONCLUSIONS Anti-ActRII blockade is an effective intervention against cancer cachexia providing benefit even in the presence of anti-cancer therapies. Co-treatment comprising chemotherapies and ActRII inhibitors might constitute a promising new approach to alleviate chemotherapy- and cancer-related wasting conditions and extend survival rates in cachectic cancer patients."

BACKGROUND Patients experiencing disuse atrophy report acute loss of skeletal muscle mass which subsequently leads to loss of strength and physical capacity.

This study aimed to explore the clinical potential of bimagrumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the activin type II receptor, for the recovery of skeletal muscle volume from disuse atrophy using an experimental model of lower extremity immobilization. METHODS In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy young men (n = 24; mean age, 24.1 years) were placed in a full-length cast of one of the lower extremities for 2 weeks to induce disuse atrophy. After cast removal, subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of either bimagrumab 30 mg/kg (n = 15) or placebo (n = 9) and were followed for 12 weeks. Changes in thigh muscle volume (TMV) and inter-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) of the thigh, maximum voluntary knee extension strength, and safety were assessed throughout the 12 week study. RESULTS Casting resulted in an average TMV loss of -4.8% and comparable increases in IMAT and SCAT volumes. Bimagrumab 30 mg/kg i.v. resulted in a rapid increase in TMV at 2 weeks following cast removal and a +5.1% increase above pre-cast levels at 12 weeks. In comparison, TMV returned to pre-cast level at 12 weeks (-0.1%) in the placebo group. The increased adiposity of the casted leg was sustained in the placebo group and decreased substantially in the bimagrumab group at Week 12 (IMAT: -6.6%, SCAT: -3.5%). Knee extension strength decreased by ~25% in the casted leg for all subjects and returned to pre-cast levels within 6 weeks after cast removal in both treatment arms. Bimagrumab was well tolerated with no serious or severe adverse events reported during the study. CONCLUSIONS A single dose of bimagrumab 30 mg/kg i.v. safely accelerated the recovery of TMV and reversal of accumulated IMAT following 2 weeks in a joint-immobilizing cast."

BACKGROUND Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are known to have a predisposition to colonization or infection by microbial organisms, including both Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus (HSV). S aureus infection leads to exacerbation of eczema and may induce flares in atopic skin by mediating inflammation. Retapamulin 1% ointment is a unique topical antibiotic formulation that may be a suitable option for the treatment of clinically infected AD. STUDY DESIGN A single-center, open-label pilot study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of retapamulin 1% (Altabax, Stiefel/ GlaxoSmithKline) ointment for the treatment of secondarily infected atopic dermatitis in subjects aged 9 months to 98 years old (n=29). RESULTS Twice-daily application of retapamulin 1% produced a mean 8.1-point reduction from baseline in the mean Skin Infection Rating Scale score. The majority of subjects achieved clinical cure with topical retapamulin therapy. Retapamulin 1% ointment was effective against S aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION Retapamulin 1% is effective for the treatment of atopic dermatitis infected with S aureus, and demonstrates efficacy against both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains. Given its efficacy and good tolerability in this pilot study, retapamulin 1% ointment should be further evaluated as a treatment for infected atopic dermatitis. It may provide convenience and efficacy with a low risk for development of bacterial resistance."

OBJECTIVES Retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. METHODS The in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by the CLSI reference agar dilution method (M11-A6). RESULTS Ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the Bacteroides fragilis group. Despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the B. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other Gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/L or less. All the investigated strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/L retapamulin. Three strains of C. difficile and one strain of C. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. Based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against Propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by <or=2 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS At <or=2 mg/L, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. The broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive. Pending further clinical investigation, retapamulin may offer an alternative treatment for anaerobic skin infections in this era of increasing resistance."

Retapamulin belongs to a newly developed class of antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections. OBJECTIVES Our aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of topical application of retapamulin ointment with topical placebo ointment in the treatment of primary impetigo. METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study, patients received either topical retapamulin ointment 1% twice daily for 5 days or topical placebo. Patients were enrolled into the study for 14 days and attended the clinic for three visits during which clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed. RESULTS Two hundred and thirteen patients were randomized, with 139 evaluable patients in the retapamulin group and 71 in the placebo group. Based on the primary efficacy endpoint of clinical response after 7 days (intention to treat), retapamulin ointment was superior to placebo (success rate 85.6% vs. 52.1%; P<0.0001). Similar results were found in the per protocol analysis and in the subgroup of patients who had a pathogen isolated at baseline. The most common adverse effect, pruritus at the application site, was reported by 6% and 1% of patients in the retapamulin and placebo groups, respectively.

One approach is to potentiate the efficacy of existing antibiotics whose spectrum of activity is limited by the permeability barrier presented by the Gram-negative outer membrane. Cationic peptides derived from polymyxin B have been used to permeabilize the outer membrane, granting antibiotics that would otherwise be excluded access to their targets. We assessed the in vitro efficacies of combinations of SPR741 with conventional antibiotics against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii Of 35 antibiotics tested, the MICs of 8 of them were reduced 32- to 8,000-fold against E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the presence of SPR741. The eight antibiotics, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, mupirocin, retapamulin, rifampin, and telithromycin, had diverse targets and mechanisms of action. Against A. baumannii, similar potentiation was achieved with clarithromycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, retapamulin, and rifampin. Susceptibility testing of the most effective antibiotic-SPR741 combinations was extended to 25 additional multidrug-resistant or clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae and 17 additional A. baumannii isolates in order to rank the potentiated antibiotics. SPR741 was also able to potentiate antibiotics that are substrates of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in E. coli, effectively circumventing the contribution of this pump to intrinsic antibiotic resistance. These studies support the further development of SPR741 in combination with conventional antibiotics for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections."

The syndecans are a type of cell surface adhesion receptor that initiates intracellular signaling events through receptor clustering mediated by their highly conserved transmembrane domains (TMDs). However, the exact function of the syndecan TMD is not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated the specific regulatory role of the syndecan-2 TMD. We found that syndecan-2 mutants in which the TMD had been replaced with that of syndecan-4 were defective in syndecan-2-mediated functions, suggesting that the TMD of syndecan-2 plays one or more specific roles. Interestingly, syndecan-2 has a stronger tendency to form sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-resistant homodimers than syndecan-4. Our structural studies showed that a unique phenylalanine residue (Phe(167)) enables an additional molecular interaction between the TMDs of the syndecan-2 homodimer. The presence of Phe(167) was correlated with a higher tendency toward oligomerization, and its replacement with isoleucine significantly reduced the SDS-resistant dimer formation and cellular functions of syndecan-2 (e.g. cell migration). Conversely, replacement of isoleucine with phenylalanine at this position in the syndecan-4 TMD rescued the defects observed in a mutant syndecan-2 harboring the syndecan-4 TMD. Taken together, these data suggest that Phe(167) in the TMD of syndecan-2 endows the protein with specific functions.

Syndecans are transmembrane proteoglycans implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, by interacting with growth factors. Although syndecans play a major role in regulating cell morphology, little is known about their subcellular distribution and in vivo association with the cytoskeleton. To address this question, we investigated the subcellular distribution and dynamic rearrangement of syndecans-1, -2, and -4, using confocal laser microscopy. Furthermore, we monitored the spatial relation of syndecans to tubulin in both mitotic and interphase cells. Initially, the reactivity to syndecans was confined to the cytoplasm, staining of the cell membranes appearing later. Syndecan-1 also seems to translocate to the nucleus in a time-dependent manner. The mitotic spindle shows unexpectedly more syndecans than that found in interphase cells. After vinblastine treatment, both syndecan-1 and tubulin were recovered as paracrystalline occlusion bodies, and the nuclear reactivity to syndecan-1 disappeared, suggesting tubulin-mediated nuclear transport of this proteoglycan. Plasma membrane staining reappeared in the postmitotic cells. Nuclear translocation predominantly affected syndecan-1, whereas syndecan-2 and -4 remained in cytoplasm and cell membrane. This is the first report on regulated nuclear translocation and the presence of syndecan-1 in the mitotic spindle, where it may stabilize the mitotic machinery.

Syndecans are a family of four cell surface proteoglycans that bind to various components of the extracellular environment and can regulate many cellular behaviors including growth, adhesion, and movement. To determine whether syndecans can function during wound repair, we have examined expression of the syndecans during wound repair of adult mouse and neonatal or fetal human skin. Syndecan-1 and -4 were induced in the dermis within 12 h after incisional injury of murine or neonatal human skin. Syndecan-1 was induced primarily on endothelium, and syndecan-4 was present throughout the dermis at the site of injury. Following re-epithelialization, expression of the syndecans return to their baseline level. In marked contrast to these observations, wounded human fetal skin showed no increase in expression of syndecans. This lack of increase in the expression of syndecans by cells of the dermis correlates with prior observations that fetal skin heals without a polymorphonuclear cell infiltrate, appreciable fibrosis, or clinically apparent scar. Thus, induced expression of syndecans is not an absolute requirement for wound repair but does correlate with the occurrence of fibrosis in mature skin. These findings support the role of syndecans as regulators of cell behavior and suggest that syndecan-1 and -4 induction in the dermis may contribute to events that lead to inflammation and fibrosis."

BACKGROUND The syndecans are the major family of transmembrane proteoglycans in animals and are known for multiple roles in cell interactions and growth factor signalling during development, inflammatory response, wound-repair and tumorigenesis. Although syndecans have been cloned from several invertebrate and vertebrate species, the extent of conservation of the family across the animal kingdom is unknown and there are gaps in our knowledge of chordate syndecans. Here, we develop a new level of knowledge for the whole syndecan family, by combining molecular phylogeny of syndecan protein sequences with analysis of the genomic contexts of syndecan genes in multiple vertebrate organisms. RESULTS We identified syndecan-encoding sequences in representative Cnidaria and throughout the Bilateria. The C1 and C2 regions of the cytoplasmic domain are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom. We identified in the variable region a universally-conserved leucine residue and a tyrosine residue that is conserved throughout the Bilateria. Of all the genomes examined, only tetrapod and fish genomes encode multiple syndecans. No syndecan-1 was identified in fish. The genomic context of each vertebrate syndecan gene is syntenic between human, mouse and chicken, and this conservation clearly extends to syndecan-2 and -3 in T. nigroviridis. In addition, tetrapod syndecans were found to be encoded from paralogous chromosomal regions that also contain the four members of the matrilin family. Whereas the matrilin-3 and syndecan-1 genes are adjacent in tetrapods, this chromosomal region appears to have undergone extensive lineage-specific rearrangements in fish. CONCLUSION Throughout the animal kingdom, syndecan extracellular domains have undergone rapid change and elements of the cytoplasmic domains have been very conserved. The four syndecan genes of vertebrates are syntenic across tetrapods, and synteny of the syndecan-2 and -3 genes is apparent between tetrapods and fish. In vertebrates, each of the four family members are encoded from paralogous genomic regions in which members of the matrilin family are also syntenic between tetrapods and fish. This genomic organization appears to have been set up after the divergence of urochordates (Ciona) and vertebrates. The syndecan-1 gene appears to have been lost relatively early in the fish lineage. These conclusions provide the basis for a new model of syndecan evolution in vertebrates and a new perspective for analyzing the roles of syndecans in cells and whole organisms."

Syndecans (SDCs) are a family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) glycoproteins ubiquitously expressed on the cell surfaces and extracellular matrix of all mammalian tissues. There are four mammalian syndecans, SDC-1 thorough 4, which play a critical role in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis through independent and growth factor mediated signaling. An altered expression of SDCs is often observed in autoimmune disorders, cancer, HIV infection, and many other pathological conditions. SDCs modulate disease progression by interacting with a diverse array of ligands, receptors, and other proteins, including extracellular matrix, glycoproteins, integrins, morphogens, and various growth factors and chemokines, along with their receptors and kinases. Specifically, SDCs present on cell surface can bind directly to chemokines to enhance their binding to receptors, downstream signaling, and migration. Alternatively, SDCs can be cleaved and shed to mediate negative regulation of chemokine and growth factor signaling pathways and ligand sequestration. Importantly, SDC shedding may be a biomarker of inflammation, especially in chronic inflammatory diseases. While the current therapies for cancer and several autoimmune disorders have revolutionized treatment outcomes, understanding the pathophysiological role of SDCs and the use of HSPG mimetic or antagonists on cytokine signaling networks may uncover potentially novel targeted therapeutic approaches. This review mainly summarizes the current findings on the role of individual SDCs in disease processes, mechanisms through which SDCs mediate their biological functions, and the possibility of targeting SDCs as future potential therapeutic approaches."

Syndecans are cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans that serve as co-receptors and modulate the actions of a number of extracellular ligands. Syndecans thereby regulate cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Studies in cancer cells suggest that syndecans may also modulate cell viability. We previously showed that syndecan-2 controls the growth of normal human osteoblastic cells. In this study, we examined the role of syndecan-2 in osteosarcoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. To this goal, MG63 osteosarcoma cells which express low syndecan-2 levels were transfected to overexpress full-length syndecan-2 or truncated syndecan-2 lacking its cytoplasmic domain. Determination of cell growth by cell counting and 3H-thymidine incorporation showed that truncated syndecan-2 inhibited MG63 cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis of DNA content and colony forming test revealed that syndecan-2, but not truncated syndecan-2, induced MG63 cell death. We show that characteristic features of apoptosis such as caspase activation, PARP cleavage, cytochrome c release, increased Bax expression, and DNA fragmentation were associated with syndecan-2-induced cell death. We further show that expression of full-length or truncated syndecan-2 induced differential activation of MAPK phosphorylation in MG63 cells. Notably, syndecan-2 but not truncated syndecan-2 overexpression increased JNK phosphorylation. Moreover, SP600125, a specific inhibitor of JNK, suppressed Bax expression induced by syndecan-2 overexpression, indicating that JNK activation mediates syndecan-2-induced apoptosis. The results show that syndecan-2 induces osteoblastic cell apoptosis through the JNK/Bax apoptotic pathway and that the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-2 is required for this action. This supports a role for syndecan-2 in the regulation of osteosarcoma cell fate and identifies one signaling pathway by which syndecan-2 induces apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells."

Syndecans are transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, neuronal development, and lipid metabolism. Syndecans are expressed in a tissue-specific manner to facilitate diverse cellular processes. As receptors and co-receptors, syndecans provide promising therapeutic targets that bind to a variety of physiologically important ligands. Negatively charged glycosaminoglycan chains of syndecans, located in the extracellular compartment, are critical for such binding. Functions of syndecans are as diverse as their ligands. For example, hepatic syndecan-1 mediates clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Syndecan-2 promotes localization of Alzheimer's amyloid A\u03b2 peptide to the cell surface, which is proposed to contribute to amyloid plaque formation. Syndecan-3 helps co-localize the appetite-regulating melanocortin-4 receptor with its agonist, leading to an increased appetite. Finally, syndecan-4 initiates the capture of modified low-density lipoproteins by macrophages and thereby promotes the atheroma formation. We hypothesize that syndecan modifications such as desulfation of glycosaminoglycan chains may contribute to a wide range of diseases, from atherosclerosis to type 2 diabetes. At the same time, desulfated syndecans may have beneficial effects, as they can inhibit amyloid plaque formation or decrease the appetite. Despite considerable progress in understanding diverse functions of syndecans, the complex physiological roles of this intriguing family of proteoglycans are far from clear. Additional studies of syndecans may potentially help develop novel therapeutic approaches and diagnostic tools to alleviate complex human diseases such as cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases."

Instead, we report, a low Bortezomib concentration, contrary to expectation, achieves severe inhibition of proteasome activity in MM cells: the degree of inhibition exceeds what one would expect from the small proportion of active-sites that Bortezomib inhibits. Our data indicate that Bortezomib achieves this severe inhibition by triggering secondary changes in proteasome structure that further inhibit proteasome activity.

In eukaryotic cells, degradation of most intracellular proteins is carried out by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Recent investigations suggest that bone metabolism is also regulated by this pathway. The clinical efficacy of bortezomib, a 26S proteasome inhibitor used as an anticancer drug, has been linked to an increase in bone formation. In this study, we show that proteasome inhibitors induce expression of osteoblastic differentiation-related genes such as osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase in C2C12 cells. In contrast, myogenic differentiation is inhibited. Among the proteasome inhibitors tested, bortezomib induced the greatest increase in osteocalcin expression. Although these effects were similar to that of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2, proteasome inhibitors did not induce transcriptional activity of Smad1/4-dependent reporter or BMP2 signaling target gene expression. Transient transfection of osteocalcin promoter-luciferase constructs with bortezomib resulted in an increase in luciferase activity. Mutation of OSE2, but not OSE1, sites of the osteocalcin promoter diminished the bortezomib-induced activity. Also, Runx2 binding activity and protein levels were induced by bortezomib treatment. These results suggest that the bortezomib induces osteoblastic differentiation by modifying the activity of Runx2 and that the function of the proteasome in controlling degradation of differentiation-related transcription factors plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation."

OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and the most aggressive of primary brain tumors. There is currently no effective treatment for this tumor. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is effective for a variety of tumors, but not for GBM. The authors' goal was to demonstrate that bortezomib can be effective in the orthotopic GBM murine model if the appropriate method of drug delivery is used. In this study the Alzet mini-osmotic pump was used to bring the drug directly to the tumor in the brain, circumventing the blood-brain barrier; thus making bortezomib an effective treatment for GBM. METHODS The 2 human glioma cell lines, U87 and U251, were labeled with luciferase and used in the subcutaneous and intracranial in vivo tumor models. Glioma cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank, or intracranially into the frontal cortex of athymic nude mice. Mice bearing intracranial glioma tumors were implanted with an Alzet mini-osmotic pump containing different doses of bortezomib. The Alzet pumps were introduced directly into the tumor bed in the brain. Survival was documented for mice with intracranial tumors. RESULTS Glioma cells were sensitive to bortezomib at nanomolar quantities in vitro. In the subcutaneous in vivo xenograft tumor model, bortezomib given intravenously was effective in reducing tumor progression. However, in the intracranial glioma model, bortezomib given systemically did not affect survival. By sharp contrast, animals treated with bortezomib intracranially at the tumor site exhibited significantly increased survival. CONCLUSIONS Bypassing the blood-brain barrier by using the osmotic pump resulted in an increase in the efficacy of bortezomib for the treatment of intracranial tumors. Thus, the intratumoral administration of bortezomib into the cranial cavity is an effective approach for glioma therapy."

The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is emerging as a potent anti-cancer agent. Still, recent clinical trials have revealed a significant secondary toxicity of bortezomib. Consequently, there is much interest in dissecting the mechanism of action of this compound to rationally improve its therapeutic index. The cytotoxic effect of bortezomib is frequently characterized by interfering with downstream events derived from the accumulation of proteasomal targets. Here we identify the first chemical agent able to act upstream of the proteasome to prevent cell killing by bortezomib. Specifically, we show that the polyhydroxyl compound Tiron can function as a competitive inhibitor of bortezomib. This effect of Tiron was surprising, since it is a classical radical spin trap and was expected to scavenge reactive oxygen species produced as a consequence of bortezomib action. The inhibitory effect of Tiron against bortezomib was selective, since it was not shared by other antioxidants, such as vitamin E, MnTBAP, L-N-acetyl-cysteine, and FK-506. Comparative analyses with nonboronated proteasome inhibitors (i.e. MG132) revealed a specificity of Tiron for bortezomib. We exploited this novel feature of Tiron to define the \"point of no return\" of proteasome inhibition in melanoma cells and to block cell death in a three-dimensional model of human skin. Cells from T-cell lymphoma, breast carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer were also responsive to Tiron, suggesting a broad impact of this agent as a bortezomib blocker. These results may have important implications for the analysis of bortezomib in vivo and for the design of drug mixtures containing proteasome inhibitors."

Viruses commandeer host cell 26S proteasome activity to promote viral entry, gene expression, replication, assembly, and egress. Proteasomal degradation activity is critical for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (also known as Velcade and PS-341) is a clinically effective antineoplastic drug that is FDA approved for treatment of hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Low nanomolar concentrations of bortezomib inhibited infection by HSV-1, HSV-2, and acyclovir-resistant strains. Inhibition coincided with minimal cytotoxicity. Bortezomib did not affect attachment of HSV to cells or inactivate the virus directly. Bortezomib acted early in HSV infection by perturbing two distinct proteasome-dependent steps that occur within the initial hours of infection: the transport of incoming viral nucleocapsids to the nucleus and the virus-induced disruption of host nuclear domain 10 (ND10) structures. The combination of bortezomib with acyclovir demonstrated synergistic inhibitory effects on HSV infection. Thus, bortezomib is a novel potential therapeutic for HSV with a defined mechanism of action.IMPORTANCE Viruses usurp host cell functions to advance their replicative agenda. HSV relies on cellular proteasome activity for successful infection. Proteasome inhibitors, such as MG132, block HSV infection at multiple stages of the infectious cycle. Targeting host cell processes for antiviral intervention is an unconventional approach that might limit antiviral resistance. Here we demonstrated that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which is a clinically effective cancer drug, has the in vitro features of a promising anti-HSV therapeutic. Bortezomib inhibited HSV infection during the first hours of infection at nanomolar concentrations that were minimally cytotoxic. The mechanism of bortezomib's inhibition of early HSV infection was to halt nucleocapsid transport to the nucleus and to stabilize the ND10 cellular defense complex. Bortezomib and acyclovir acted synergistically to inhibit HSV infection. Overall, we present evidence for the repurposing of bortezomib as a novel antiherpesviral agent and describe specific mechanisms of action."

The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, registered for Multiple Myeloma treatment, is currently explored for activity in solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we studied the proteasome-based mechanisms underlying intrinsic and acquired bortezomib resistance in NSCLC cells. Various NSCLC cell lines displayed differential intrinsic sensitivities to bortezomib. High basal chymotrypsin- and caspase-like proteasome activities correlated with bortezomib resistance in these cells. Next, via stepwise selection, acquired bortezomib resistant cells were obtained with 8-70-fold increased resistance. Cross-resistance was found to proteasome inhibitors specifically targeting \u03b2-subunits, but not to the novel \u03b1-subunit-specific proteasome inhibitor (5AHQ). Consistently, bortezomib-resistant cells required higher bortezomib concentrations to induce G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, bortezomib concentration-dependent caspase cleavage, Mcl-1 and NOXA accumulation remained intact in resistant H460 and SW1573 cells, while A549 resistant cells displayed different expression profiles suggesting additional and more protein specific adaptations. Furthermore, bortezomib-resistant cells exhibited increased levels of both constitutive and immuno-\u03b2-subunits. Sequence analysis of the bortezomib-binding pocket in the \u03b25-subunit revealed Ala49Thr, Met45Val and Cys52Phe substitutions that were not previously described in solid tumors. Bortezomib-resistant cells displayed reduced catalytic proteasome activities and required higher bortezomib concentrations to achieve comparable inhibition of proteasome activity. Taken together, these findings establish that high basal levels of proteasome activity correlate with intrinsic bortezomib resistance. Furthermore, acquired bortezomib resistance in NSCLC is associated with proteasome subunit overexpression and emergence of mutant \u03b25-subunits that likely compromise bortezomib binding. \u03b1-Subunit-specific proteasome inhibitors, however, can efficiently bypass this resistance modality."

Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has emerged as a rational approach in the treatment of human cancer. Based on positive preclinical and clinical studies, bortezomib was subsequently approved for the clinical use as a front-line treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, for which this drug has become the staple of treatment. The approval of bortezomib by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) represented a significant milestone as the first proteasome inhibitor to be implemented in the treatment of malignant disease. Bortezomib has shown a positive clinical benefit either alone or as a part of combination therapy to induce chemo-/radio-sensitization or overcome drug resistance. One of the major mechanisms of bortezomib associated with its anticancer activity is through upregulation of NOXA, which is a proapoptotic protein, and NOXA may interact with the anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 subfamily Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2, and result in apoptotic cell death in malignant cells. Another important mechanism of bortezomib is through suppression of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway resulting in the down-regulation of its anti-apoptotic target genes. Although the majority of success achieved with bortezomib has been in hematological malignancies, its effect toward solid tumors has been less than encouraging. Additionally, the widespread clinical use of bortezomib continues to be hampered by the appearance of dose-limiting toxicities, drug-resistance and interference by some natural compounds. These findings could help guide physicians in refining the clinical use of bortezomib, and encourage basic scientists to generate next generation proteasome inhibitors that broaden the spectrum of efficacy and produce a more durable clinical response in cancer patients. Other desirable applications for the use of proteasome inhibitors include the development of inhibitors against specific E3 ligases, which act at an early step in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and the discovery of less toxic and novel proteasome inhibitors from natural products and traditional medicines, which may provide more viable drug candidates for cancer chemoprevention and the treatment of cancer patients in the future."

Bortezomib (Velcade\u2122) is a reversible proteasome inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Despite its demonstrated clinical success, some patients are deprived of treatment due to primary refractoriness or development of resistance during therapy. To investigate the role of the duration of proteasome inhibition in the anti-tumor response of bortezomib, we established clonal isolates of HT-29 adenocarcinoma cells adapted to continuous exposure of bortezomib. These cells were ~30-fold resistant to bortezomib. Two novel and distinct mutations in the \u03b25 subunit, Cys63Phe, located distal to the binding site in a helix critical for drug binding, and Arg24Cys, found in the propeptide region were found in all resistant clones. The latter mutation is a natural variant found to be elevated in frequency in patients with MM. Proteasome activity and levels of both the constitutive and immunoproteasome were increased in resistant cells, which correlated to an increase in subunit gene expression. These changes correlated with a more rapid recovery of proteasome activity following brief exposure to bortezomib. Increased recovery rate was not due to increased proteasome turnover as similar findings were seen in cells co-treated with cycloheximide. When we exposed resistant cells to the irreversible proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib we noted a slower rate of recovery of proteasome activity as compared to bortezomib in both parental and resistant cells. Importantly, carfilzomib maintained its cytotoxic potential in the bortezomib resistant cell lines. Therefore, resistance to bortezomib, can be overcome with irreversible inhibitors, suggesting prolonged proteasome inhibition induces a more potent anti-tumor response."

In the current study, we examined whether proteasome inhibitors have similar bone-protective effects against radiation damage.

METHODS Retrospective multicentric analysis of French adult patients with ASMD over the period 1985-March 2015. Clinical, biological, and imaging data were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (19 males, 9 females) were analyzed. Diagnosis was made before the age of 10 years in 16 cases. Main symptoms at diagnosis were spleen/liver enlargement and interstitial lung disease. Biological abnormalities included: thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 000/mm3) in 24 cases including 4 patients with platelet count <60 000/mm3, constantly low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (n=6), monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (n=5), normal prothrombin level discordant with low factor V (n=5), elevated chitotriosidase level (n=11). The diagnosis was confirmed in all cases by deficient acid sphingomyelinase enzyme activity. SMPD1 gene sequencing was performed in 25 cases. The frequent p.R610del mutation was largely predominant, constituting 62% of the non-related alleles. During the follow-up period, three patients died before 50 years of age from cirrhosis, heart failure and lung insufficiency, respectively. CONCLUSION ASMD in adulthood (NP-B) associates spleen/liver enlargement and interstitial lung disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential for reducing the risk of complications, improving quality of life, and avoiding inappropriate procedures such as splenectomy.

The clinical spectrum distinguishes a severe infantile neurological form (type A), a non-neurological visceral form (type B) and a rare intermediate neurovisceral form. We report the first case of presymptomatic cord blood transplantation in a child with the intermediate type of ASM deficiency due to a homozygous Tyr369Cys mutation, whose affected elder brother had developed neurodevelopmental delay from 19 months of age, and had died from severe visceral complications at the age of 3. In the transplanted propositus, neurological deterioration became evident by 4 years of age; the child was alive at age 8, although severely disabled. Whereas the transplant prevented visceral progression and early death, it could only delay neurocognitive deterioration."

Niemann-Pick disease (types A and B), or acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, is an inherited deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase, resulting in intralysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells throughout the body, particularly within those of the reticuloendothelial system. These cellular changes result in hepatosplenomegaly and pulmonary infiltrates in humans. A knockout mouse model mimics many elements of human ASMD and is useful for studying disease histopathology. However, traditional formalin-fixation and paraffin embedding of ASMD tissues dissolves sphingomyelin, resulting in tissues with a foamy cell appearance, making quantitative analysis of the substrate difficult. To optimize substrate fixation and staining, a modified osmium tetroxide and potassium dichromate postfixation method was developed to preserve sphingomyelin in epon-araldite embedded tissue and pulmonary cytology specimens. After processing, semi-thin sections were incubated with tannic acid solution followed by staining with toluidine blue/borax. This modified method provides excellent preservation and staining contrast of sphingomyelin with other cell structures. The resulting high-resolution light microscopy sections permit digital quantification of sphingomyelin in light microscopic fields. A lysenin affinity stain for sphingomyelin was also developed for use on these semi-thin epon sections. Finally, ultrathin serial sections can be cut from these same tissue blocks and stained for ultrastructural examination by electron microscopy."

BACKGROUND Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), due to mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene, is divided into infantile neurovisceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type A), chronic neurovisceral ASMD (intermediate form, Niemann-Pick type A/B) and chronic visceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type B). We conducted a long-term observational, single-center study including 16 patients with chronic visceral ASMD. RESULTS 12 patients were diagnosed in childhood and 4 others in adulthood, the oldest at the age of 50. The mean time of follow-up was approximately 10 years (range: 6 months - 36 years). Splenomegaly was noted in all patients at diagnosis. Hepatomegaly was observed in 88% of patients. Moderately elevated (several-fold above the upper limit of normal values) serum transaminases were noted in 38% of patients. Cherry-red spots were found in five Gypsy children from one family and also in one adult Polish patient, a heterozygote for p.delR610 mutation. Dyslipidemia was noted in 50% of patients. Interstitial lung disease was diagnosed in 44% of patients. Plasmatic lysosphingomyelin (SPC) was elevated in all the patients except one with p.V36A homozygosity and a very mild phenotype also presenting with elevated plasmatic SPC-509 but normal chitotriosidase activity. The most common variant of SMPD1 gene was p.G166R. We found a previously unreported variant in exon 2 (c.491G > T, p.G164 V) in one patient. CONCLUSIONS Chronic visceral ASMD could constitute a slowly progressing disease with a relatively good outcome. The combined measurement of lysosphingomyelin (SPC) and lysospingomyelin-509 (SPC-509) is an essential method for the assessment of ASMD course."

BACKGROUND Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), [Niemann-Pick Disease Types A and B (NPD A and B)], is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase. Accumulation of sphingomyelin in hepatocytes, reticuloendothelial cells, and in some cases neurons, results in a progressive multisystem disease that encompasses a broad clinical spectrum of neurological and visceral involvement, including: infantile neurovisceral ASMD (NPD A) that is uniformly fatal by 3years of age; chronic neurovisceral ASMD (intermediate NPD A/B; NPD B variant) that has later symptom onset and slower neurological and visceral disease progression; and chronic visceral ASMD (NPD B) that lacks neurological symptoms but has significant disease-related morbidities in multiple organ systems. The purpose of this study was to characterize disease-related morbidities and causes of death in patients with the chronic visceral and chronic neurovisceral forms of ASMD. METHODS Data for 85 patients who had died or received liver transplant were collected by treating physicians (n=27), or abstracted from previously published case studies (n=58). Ages at symptom onset, diagnosis, and death; cause of death; organ involvement, and morbidity were analyzed. RESULTS Common disease-related morbidities included splenomegaly (96.6%), hepatomegaly (91.4%), liver dysfunction (82.6%), and pulmonary disease (75.0%). The overall leading causes of death were respiratory failure and liver failure (27.7% each) irrespective of age. For patients with chronic neurovisceral ASMD (31.8%), progression of neurodegenerative disease was a leading cause of death along with respiratory disease (both 23.1%) and liver disease (19.2%). Patients with chronic neurovisceral disease died at younger ages than those with chronic visceral disease (median age at death 8 vs. 23.5years). CONCLUSIONS The analysis emphasizes that treatment goals for patients with chronic visceral and chronic neurovisceral ASMD should include reducing splenomegaly and improving liver function and respiratory status, with the ultimate goal of decreasing serious morbidity and mortality."

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), a rare lysosomal storage disease, is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by different SMPD1 mutations. Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B). NPD A is associated with a uniformly devastating disease course, with rapidly progressing psychomotor degeneration, leading to death typically by the age of 3 years, most often from respiratory failure. In contrast, the clinical phenotype and life expectancy of patients with NPD B may vary widely. Almost all patients have hepatosplenomegaly and an atherogenic lipid profile, and most patients have interstitial lung disease with progressive impairment of pulmonary function and hematologic abnormalities including cytopenias. Other common clinical manifestations include liver dysfunction, heart disease, skeletal abnormalities and growth delays. Some patients with ASMD who survive beyond early childhood have intermediate phenotypes (variant NPD B) characterized by combinations of non-neurologic and mild to severe neurologic symptoms. The physical and psychosocial burden of illness in patients with NPD B is substantial. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, joint or limb pain, abdominal pain, bleeding and bruising. The disease often leads to chronic fatigue, limited physical or social activity and difficulties in performing daily activities or work. Many patients die before or in early adulthood, often from pneumonia/respiratory failure or liver failure. Available treatments are limited to symptom management and supportive care. An enzyme replacement therapy currently in clinical development is expected to be the first treatment addressing the underlying pathology of the disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential for reducing the risk of complications. While knowledge about ASMD is evolving, more evidence about ASMD and the natural history across the disease spectrum is needed, to improve disease recognition, timely diagnosis and appropriate disease management."

BACKGROUND Olipudase alfa, a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (rhASM), is an investigational enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for patients with ASM deficiency [ASMD; Niemann-Pick Disease (NPD) A and B]. This open-label phase 1b study assessed the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa using within-patient dose escalation to gradually debulk accumulated sphingomyelin and mitigate the rapid production of metabolites, which can be toxic. Secondary objectives were pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and exploratory efficacy. METHODS Five adults with nonneuronopathic ASMD (NPD B) received escalating doses (0.1 to 3.0 mg/kg) of olipudase alfa intravenously every 2 weeks for 26 weeks. RESULTS All patients successfully reached 3.0mg/kg without serious or severe adverse events. One patient repeated a dose (2.0 mg/kg) and another had a temporary dose reduction (1.0 to 0.6 mg/kg). Most adverse events (97%) were mild and all resolved without sequelae. The most common adverse events were headache, arthralgia, nausea and abdominal pain. Two patients experienced single acute phase reactions. No patient developed hypersensitivity or anti-olipudase alfa antibodies. The mean circulating half-life of olipudase alfa ranged from 20.9 to 23.4h across doses without accumulation. Ceramide, a sphingomyelin catabolite, rose transiently in plasma after each dose, but decreased over time. Reductions in sphingomyelin storage, spleen and liver volumes, and serum chitotriosidase activity, as well as improvements in infiltrative lung disease, lipid profiles, platelet counts, and quality of life assessments, were observed.

INTRODUCTION Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD, also known as Niemann-Pick Type A and Type B disease) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. Liver-related issues, including cirrhosis and variceal haemorrhage, are a leading cause of early mortality in individuals with chronic forms of ASMD. Due to the rarity of this lysosomal storage disorder, there can be a lack of awareness that adults with chronic ASMD disease are at significant risk of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and variceal bleeding. This case highlights an unusual presentation of recurrent variceal bleeding in an adult with cirrhosis and portal hypertension due to chronic visceral ASMD. CASE PRESENTATION A patient with severe splenomegaly was diagnosed with ASMD at age of 25. At age 64 they had multiple hospital admissions for hematochezia (originally diagnosed as ischemic colitis) accompanied by hypotension (blood pressure 91/45 mmHg), anemia (hemoglobin 8.5g/dL, ref 12-16; INR 1.4, ref \u22641.2), and mild renal insufficiency (creatinine 1.33mg/dL, ref 0.51-0.95). Colonoscopy did not reveal a source of bleeding. Computerized tomography scanning imaging showed diffuse venous collaterals and ascites. Arteriographies during subsequent episodes of bleeding were negative for active arterial intestinal bleeding. Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding was found to originate from a varicose vein cluster connected to the right iliac vein and the superior mesenteric vein, located in the submucosa of a small intestinal loop. Multiple varices were secondary to portal hypertension in the context of cirrhosis. The patient died from recurrent variceal bleeding that exacerbated liver failure worsened by pneumonia and hypovolemic and septic shock. CONCLUSIONS The variceal bleeding in this patient was atypical in that it originated from venous collaterals bleeding into the small intestine rather than the more typical gastroesophageal varices observed in ASMD. With long standing liver dysfunction and gradual development of portal hypertension, intestinal varices rather than occult intestinal bleeding due to ischemia should be considered in ASMD patients presenting with either hematochezia or hematemesis."

Second-generation ABL1 kinase inhibitors induce more potent molecular responses in both previously untreated and imatinib-resistant patients with CML. Studies in patients with chronic-phase CML have shown that around 50% of patients who achieve and maintain undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcript levels for at least 2 years remain disease-free after the withdrawal of treatment. Here we characterize ABL001 (asciminib), a potent and selective allosteric ABL1 inhibitor that is undergoing clinical development testing in patients with CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In contrast to catalytic-site ABL1 kinase inhibitors, ABL001 binds to the myristoyl pocket of ABL1 and induces the formation of an inactive kinase conformation. ABL001 and second-generation catalytic inhibitors have similar cellular potencies but distinct patterns of resistance mutations, with genetic barcoding studies revealing pre-existing clonal populations with no shared resistance between ABL001 and the catalytic inhibitor nilotinib. Consistent with this profile, acquired resistance was observed with single-agent therapy in mice; however, the combination of ABL001 and nilotinib led to complete disease control and eradicated CML xenograft tumours without recurrence after the cessation of treatment."

Asciminib sensitivity was evaluated in asciminib na\u00efve BCR-ABL1+ cell lines K562 (negligible ABCB1/ABCG2 expression), K562-Dox (ABCB1-overexpressing through doxorubicin exposure) and K562-ABCG2 (ABCG2 overexpression via transduction) with results demonstrating asciminib efflux by both ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters. K562-Dox and K562-ABCG2 cells demonstrated increased LD50asciminib vs K562 control cells: 256 and 299 nM respectively vs 24 nM, p < 0.001.

When asciminib resistance was modelled in vitro, ABCB1 and ABCG2 overexpression was integral in the development of asciminib resistance. In K562 asciminib-resistant cells, ABCG2 expression increased prior to BCR-ABL1 overexpression and remained high (up to 7.6-fold greater levels in resistant vs control cells, p < 0.001). K562-Dox asciminib-resistant cells had increased ABCB1 expression (2.1-fold vs control cells p = 0.0033). KU812 asciminib-resistant cells overexpressed ABCB1 (5.4-fold increase, p < 0.001) and ABCG2 (6-fold increase, p < 0.001) before emergence of a novel myristate-binding pocket mutation (F497L). In all three cell lines, asciminib resistance was reversible upon chemical inhibition of ABCB1, ABCG2 or both (p < 0.001). When K562 asciminib-resistant cells were treated with asciminib in combination with clinically achievable doses of either imatinib or nilotinib, reversal of the resistance phenotype was also observed (p < 0.01). Overexpression of efflux transporters will likely be an important pathway for asciminib resistance in the clinical setting. Given the lack of evidence for ABCG2-mediated transport of nilotinib or imatinib at clinically relevant concentrations, our data provide an additional rationale for using asciminib in combination with either TKI."

BACKGROUND Asciminib is an allosteric inhibitor that binds a myristoyl site of the BCR-ABL1 protein, locking BCR-ABL1 into an inactive conformation through a mechanism distinct from those for all other ABL kinase inhibitors. Asciminib targets both native and mutated BCR-ABL1, including the gatekeeper T315I mutant. The safety and antileukemic activity of asciminib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia are unknown. METHODS In this phase 1, dose-escalation study, we enrolled 141 patients with chronic-phase and 9 with accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who had resistance to or unacceptable side effects from at least two previous ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended dose (or both) of asciminib. Asciminib was administered once or twice daily (at doses of 10 to 200 mg). The median follow-up was 14 months. RESULTS Patients were heavily pretreated; 70% (105 of 150 patients) had received at least three TKIs. The maximum tolerated dose of asciminib was not reached. Among patients with chronic-phase CML, 34 (92%) with a hematologic relapse had a complete hematologic response; 31 (54%) without a complete cytogenetic response at baseline had a complete cytogenetic response. A major molecular response was achieved or maintained by 12 months in 48% of patients who could be evaluated, including 8 of 14 (57%) deemed to have resistance to or unacceptable side effects from ponatinib. A major molecular response was achieved or maintained by 12 months in 5 patients (28%) with a T315I mutation at baseline. Clinical responses were durable; a major molecular response was maintained in 40 of 44 patients. Dose-limiting toxic effects included asymptomatic elevations in the lipase level and clinical pancreatitis. Common adverse events included fatigue, headache, arthralgia, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS Asciminib was active in heavily pretreated patients with CML who had resistance to or unacceptable side effects from TKIs, including patients in whom ponatinib had failed and those with a T315I mutation.

Asciminib, a highly selective non-ATP competitive inhibitor of BCR-ABL, has demonstrated to be a promising drug for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. It is a pity that two resistant mutations (I502L and V468F) have been found during the clinical trial, which is a challenge for the curative effect of Asciminib. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GB/SA) calculations were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism of Asciminib resistance induced by the two mutants. The obtained results indicate that the mutations have adversely influence on the binding of Asciminib to BCR-ABL, as the nonpolar contributions decline in the two mutants. In addition, I502L mutation causes \u03b1-helix I' (\u03b1I') to shift away from the helical bundle composed of \u03b1E, \u03b1F, and \u03b1H, making the distance between \u03b1I' and Asciminib increased.

Bcr-Abl is an oncogenic fusion protein which expression enhances tumorigenesis, and has been highly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Acquired drug resistance in mutant Bcr-Abl has enhanced pathogenesis with the use of single therapy agents such as nilotinib. Moreover, allosteric targeting has been identified to consequentially inhibit Bcr-Abl activity, which led to the recent development of ABL-001 (asciminib) that selectively binds the myristoyl pocket. Experimental studies have revealed that the combination of nilotinib and ABL-001 induced a 'bent' conformation in the C-terminal helix of Bcr-Abl; a benchmark of inhibition, thereby exhibiting a greater potency in the treatment of CML, surmounting the setbacks of drug resistance, disease regression and relapse. Therefore, we report the first account of the dynamics and conformational analysis of oncogenic T334I Bcr-Abl by dual targeting. Our findings revealed that unlike in the Bcr-Abl-Nilotinib complex, dual targeting by both inhibitors induced the bent conformation in the C-terminal helix that varied with time. This was coupled with significant alteration in Bcr-Abl stability, flexibility, and compactness and an overall structural re-orientation inwards towards the hydrophobic core, which reduced the solvent-exposed residues indicative of protein folding. This study will facilitate allosteric targeting and the design of more potent allosteric inhibitors for resistive target proteins in cancer."

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by a pathognomonic chromosomal translocation, which leads to the fusion of breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and Abelson leukemia virus 1 (ABL1) genes, generating an oncoprotein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. Areas covered: In the last two decades, BCR/ABL1 kinase has become the molecular target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a class of drugs that impressively improved overall survival. Despite these results, a proportion of patients experiences resistance to TKIs and need to change treatment. Furthermore, TKIs are unable to eradicate leukemic stem cells, allowing the persistence of neoplastic clones. Therefore, there is still clinical need for new agents to overcome common resistance mechanisms to available drugs. This review explores the horizon of drugs actually under investigation for CML patients resistant to conventional treatment. Expert commentary: Radotinib is an ATP-competitive TKI that showed significant activity also in front-line setting and could find employment indications in CML. Asciminib, an allosteric ABL1 inhibitor, could demonstrate a higher capacity in overcoming common TKIs resistant mutations, including T315I, but clinical findings are needed. CML stem cell target will probably require new therapeutic strategies: combinations of several compounds acting with different mechanisms of action are actually under investigation."

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) arises from the constitutive activity of the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the ATP-binding site have transformed CML into a chronic manageable disease. However, some patients develop drug resistance due to ATP-site mutations impeding drug binding. We describe the discovery of asciminib (ABL001), the first allosteric BCR-ABL1 inhibitor to reach the clinic. Asciminib binds to the myristate pocket of BCR-ABL1 and maintains activity against TKI-resistant ATP-site mutations. Although resistance can emerge due to myristate-site mutations, these are sensitive to ATP-competitive inhibitors so that combinations of asciminib with ATP-competitive TKIs suppress the emergence of resistance. Fragment-based screening using NMR and X-ray yielded ligands for the myristate pocket. An NMR-based conformational assay guided the transformation of these inactive ligands into ABL1 inhibitors. Further structure-based optimization for potency, physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and drug-like properties, culminated in asciminib, which is currently undergoing clinical studies in CML patients."

SATB1 (special AT-rich binding protein 1) is a global chromatin organizer regulating the expression of a large number of genes. Overexpression has been found in various solid tumors and positively correlated with prognostic and clinicopathological properties. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SATB1 overexpression and its correlation with poor differentiation, invasive depth, TNM (tumor, nodes, metastases) stage and prognosis have been demonstrated. However, more detailed studies on the SATB1 functions in CRC are warranted. In this article, we comprehensively analyze the cellular and molecular role of SATB1 in CRC cell lines with different SATB1 expression levels by using RNAi-mediated knockdown. Using siRNAs with different knockdown efficacies, we demonstrate antiproliferative, cell cycle-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of SATB1 knockdown in a SATB1 gene dose-dependent manner. Tumor growth inhibition is confirmed in vivo in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model using stable knockdown cells. The in-depth analysis of cellular effects reveals increased activities of caspases-3, -7, -8, -9 and other mediators of apoptotic pathways. Similarly, the analysis of E- and N-cadherin, slug, twist, \u03b2-catenin and MMP7 indicates SATB1 effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and matrix breakdown. Our results also establish SATB1 effects on receptor tyrosine kinases and (proto-)oncogenes such as HER receptors and Pim-1. Taken together, this suggests a more complex molecular interplay between tumor-promoting and possible inhibitory effects in CRC by affecting multiple pathways and molecules involved in proliferation, cell cycle, EMT, invasion and cell survival."

BACKGROUND Special AT rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1) plays a crucial role in the biology of various types of human cancer. However, the role of SATB1 in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains unknown. In the present study, we sought to investigate the contribution of aberrant SATB1 expression in the progression of NPC and its association with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1). METHODS Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect SATB1 and LMP-1 protein in clinical samples, and the association of SATB1 protein expression with patient clinicopathological characteristics and LMP-1 expression were analyzed. SATB1 expression profiles were evaluated in well-differentiated NPC cell line CNE1, poorly-differentiated CNE2Z, undifferentiated C666-1 and immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelia NP-69 cells using quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting and fluorescent staining. After inhibition the SATB1 expression by using SATB1 specific small interfering RNA in these cell lines, the change of cell proliferation was investigated by western blotting analysis of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) expression and CCK-8 assay, and the cell migration was assessed by Transwell migration assay. Finally, the expressions of SATB1 and PCNA were examined in CNE1 cells that forced LMP-1 expression by fluorescent staining and RT-PCR. RESULTS Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that SATB1 protein expression was elevated in NPC tissues compared to benign nasopharyngeal tissues (P = 0.005). Moreover, high levels of SATB1 protein expression were positively correlated with clinical stage (P = 0.025), the status of lymph node metastasis (N classification) (P = 0.018), distant metastasis (M classification) (P = 0.041) and LMP-1 expression status (r = 2.35, P < 0.01) in NPC patients. In vitro experiments demonstrated that an inverse relationship between SATB1 expression and NPC differentiation status, with SATB1 weakly expressed in NP-69 cells and CNE1 cells, and significant increasingly expressed in CNE-2Z and C666-1 cells. Targeted knockdown of SATB1 expression obviously attenuated the proliferation and migration of highly SATB1-expressing CNE2Z and C666-1 cells, but not NP-69 and CNE1 cells. Interestingly, forced LMP-1 expression in CNE1 cells led to a surprisingly increasing SATB1 expression and nuclear location, companying with an up-regulated PCNA expression. CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal that EBV LMP-1-mediated over-expression of SATB1 is associated with NPC progression, suggesting SATB1 may represent a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for NPC."

SATB1 (special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1) provides a key link between DNA loop organization, chromatin modification/remodeling, and association of transcription factors at matrix attachment regions (MARs). To investigate the role of SATB1 in cellular events, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen that identified SUMO-1, Ubc9, and protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family members as SATB1 interaction partners. These proteins, working in concert, enhanced SUMO conjugation to lysine-744 of SATB1. Overexpression of SUMO or PIAS in Jurkat cells, which express high levels of endogenous SATB1, exhibited enhanced caspase cleavage of this MAR-associating protein. Sumoylation-deficient SATB1 (SATB1(K744R)) failed to display the characteristic caspase cleavage pattern; however, fusion of SUMO in-frame to SATB1(K744R) restored cleavage. A SUMO-independent interaction of inactive caspase-6 and SATB1 was noted. A subset of total cellular SATB1 localized into promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies where enhanced SATB1 cleavage was detected subsequent to caspase activation. These results reveal a novel sumoylation-directed caspase cleavage of this key regulatory molecule. The role of regulated proteolysis of SATB1 may be to control transcription in immune cells during normal cell functions or to assist in efficient and rapid clearance of nonfunctional or potentially damaging immune cells."

The addition of more cases with the same genetic characteristics would establish an acquired aberration as a recurrent change, help determine its prognostic significance, and can provide insight into the mechanisms of leukemogenesis in patients with these rare abnormalities. CASE REPORT RNA-sequencing was performed on a patient with AML with the bone marrow karyotype 46,XY,t(3;5)(p24;q14)[5]/46,XY[10]. The translocation resulted in fusion of the SATB homeobox 1 gene (SATB1) (3p24) with an expression sequence tag with accession number BG503445 (5q14). The SATB1-BG503445 transcript may code for a SATB1 protein that would lack the C-terminal DNA-binding homeodomain. CONCLUSION The present study is the first to demonstrate rearrangement and disruption of SATB1 in AML. Rearrangements of chromosome band 3p24 were reported in 24 additional AMLs but not in known leukemia-specific chromosomal abnormalities. Further studies are needed to determine whether SATB1-BG503445 or other aberrations of SATB1 are recurrent in AML."

AIM Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a cell type-specific matrix attachment region binding protein, functioning as a global genome organizer. This study aims to investigate the expression pattern and the prognostic value of SATB1 in colorectal cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS Prospectively collected data were obtained and tissue microarrays were constructed from a cohort of 352 patients. SATB1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and scored by two independent investigators. SATB1 expression was predominantly nuclear in both normal and cancer tissues. Loss of SATB1 nuclear expression was seen in 22% of colorectal cancers compared to 1.5% of adjacent normal colorectal tissue, and was associated with worse overall survival (P = 0.02) independent of age and stage of disease (HR 2.48 with 95% CI 1.31-4.70). Loss of SATB1 expression was more evident in younger patients (P = 0.03), tumours with mucinous or signet ring histology (P = 0.0001) and poor differentiation (P = 0.005). SATB1 expression was associated with a survival advantage in patients with Dukes C tumours who received adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION Loss of SATB1 nuclear expression correlates with poor survival and a less favourable response to adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. The value of SATB1 in individualized colorectal cancer therapy warrants further evaluation."

Interestingly, 70% of the t(14,18) translocations are confined to three 15-bp clusters positioned within a 150-bp region (major breakpoint region or [MBR]) in the untranslated portion of terminal exon 3. We analyzed DNA-protein interactions in the MBR, as these may play some role in targeting the translocation to this region. An 87-bp segment (87MBR) immediately 3' to breakpoint cluster 3 was essential for DNA-protein interaction monitored with mobility shift assays. We further delineated a core binding region within 87MBR: a 33-bp, very AT-rich sequence highly conserved between the human and mouse BCL2 gene (37MBR). We have purified and identified one of the core factors as the matrix attachment region (MAR) binding protein, SATB1, which is known to bind to AT-rich sequences with a high propensity to unwind. Additional factors in nuclear extracts, which we have not yet characterized further, increased SATB1 affinity for the 37MBR target four- to fivefold. Specific binding activity within 37MBR displayed cell cycle regulation in Jurkat T cells, while levels of SATB1 remained constant throughout the cell cycle.

The sequences of two foot-printed regions (sites I and IV) are A-T rich and generate a highly retarded complex on gel shift analysis with nuclear extract from human erythroleukemia (K562) cells. We have purified a 98-kD protein that reproduces this gel shift.

We have shown by functional analysis that the 3' A gamma regulatory element associates with the nuclear matrix. SATB1 mRNA was identified in K562 cells, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated its transcript in several other hematopoietic lines. Antisera to SATB1 caused ablation of the gel shift complex generated by both the crude nuclear extract and the purified 98-kD protein with the site I oligonucleotide. Furthermore, oligonucleotides that bind SATB1 inhibited formation of the site I gel shift complex when added as excess unlabeled competitor. An immunoblot analysis of the site I gel shift complex documented the presence of SATB1.

Thus, SATB1 affects the expression of various genes by multiple mechanisms of action, involving three-dimensional chromatin architecture. More recently, SATB1 has been connected with solid tumors, tumorigenesis, tumor progression and tumor immunity. On the diagnostic side, SATB1 levels were found to correlate with clinicopathological features like increased TNM stage, reduced tumor differentiation, and a shorter overall survival. SATB1 expression was also identified as an independent prognostic marker in various cancers. Moreover, different gene knockdown or ectopic overexpression strategies in cancer cells have identified SATB1 to affect proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, cell morphology / cell polarity, EMT and multidrug-resistance as well as tumor formation, growth, invasion and metastasis in vivo. These processes are mediated through a great multitude of SATB1 target genes, including many (proto-) oncogenes.

Such regions confer a high propensity for stable base unpairing. Using an in vivo cross-linking strategy, specialized genomic sequences (0.1-1. 1 kbp) that bind to SATB1 in human lymphoblastic cell line Jurkat cells were individually isolated and characterized. All in vivo SATB1-binding sequences examined contained typical ATC sequence contexts, with some exhibiting homology to autonomously replicating sequences from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that function as replication origins in yeast cells. In addition, LINE 1 elements, satellite 2 sequences, and CpG island-containing DNA were identified. To examine the higher-order packaging of these in vivo SATB1-binding sequences, high-resolution in situ fluorescence hybridization was performed with both nuclear \"halos\" with distended loops and the nuclear matrix after the majority of DNA had been removed by nuclease digestion. In vivo SATB1-binding sequences hybridized to genomic DNA as single spots within the residual nucleus circumscribed by the halo of DNA and remained as single spots in the nuclear matrix, indicating that these sequences are localized at the base of chromatin loops.

Base excision repair is initiated by DNA glycosylases that recognize specific altered bases. DNA glycosylases for oxidized bases carry both a glycosylase activity that removes the faulty base and an apyrimidinic/apurinic lyase activity that introduces a single-strand DNA incision. In particular, the CUT domains within the CUX1 and CUX2 proteins were recently shown to interact with the 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) DNA glycosylase and stimulate its enzymatic activities. SATB1, which contains two CUT domains, was originally characterized as a T cell-specific genome organizer whose aberrant overexpression in breast cancer can promote tumor progression. Here we investigated the involvement of SATB1 in DNA repair. SATB1 knockdown caused a delay in DNA repair following exposure to H2O2, an increase in OGG1-sensitive oxidized bases within genomic DNA, and a decrease in 8-oxoG cleavage activity in cell extracts. In parallel, we observed an increase in phospho-CHK1 and \u03b3-H2AX levels and a decrease in DNA synthesis. Conversely, ectopic expression of SATB1 accelerated DNA repair and reduced the levels of oxidized bases in genomic DNA. Moreover, an enhanced GFP-SATB1 fusion protein was rapidly recruited to laser microirradiation-induced DNA damage. Using purified proteins, we showed that SATB1 interacts directly with OGG1, increases its binding to 8-oxoG-containing DNA, promotes Schiff base formation, and stimulates its glycosylase and apyrimidinic/apurinic lyase enzymatic activities. Structure/function analysis demonstrated that CUT domains, but not the homeodomain, are responsible for the stimulation of OGG1. Together, these results identify another CUT domain protein that functions both as a transcription factor and an accessory factor in base excision repair."

The monogenic mutation in HD encodes a variant of the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The disease is a consequence of a CAG repeat extension leading to an abnormally long polyglutamine (Q) stretch at HTT's N-terminus, which likely confers a toxic gain of function to the mutant polypeptide. HD has currently no effective disease-modifying therapy or preventive measures.

Dysfunctions in brain cholesterol homeostasis have been extensively related to brain disorders. The main pathway for brain cholesterol elimination is its hydroxylation into 24S-hydroxycholesterol by the cholesterol 24-hydrolase, CYP46A1. Increasing evidence suggests that CYP46A1 has a role in the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disorders, and that increasing its levels in the brain is neuroprotective. However, the mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection remain to be fully understood. Huntington's disease is a fatal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal CAG expansion in huntingtin's gene. Among the multiple cellular and molecular dysfunctions caused by this mutation, altered brain cholesterol homeostasis has been described in patients and animal models as a critical event in Huntington's disease. Here, we demonstrate that a gene therapy approach based on the delivery of CYP46A1, the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol degradation in the brain, has a long-lasting neuroprotective effect in Huntington's disease and counteracts multiple detrimental effects of the mutated huntingtin. In zQ175 Huntington's disease knock-in mice, CYP46A1 prevented neuronal dysfunctions and restored cholesterol homeostasis. These events were associated to a specific striatal transcriptomic signature that compensates for multiple mHTT-induced dysfunctions. We thus explored the mechanisms for these compensations and showed an improvement of synaptic activity and connectivity along with the stimulation of the proteasome and autophagy machineries, which participate to the clearance of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates. Furthermore, BDNF vesicle axonal transport and TrkB endosome trafficking were restored in a cellular model of Huntington's disease. These results highlight the large-scale beneficial effect of restoring cholesterol homeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases and give new opportunities for developing innovative disease-modifying strategies in Huntington's disease."

Careful comparison of symptomatic individuals with normal controls has revealed the primary biochemical abnormality in many human genetic diseases, particularly recessive disorders. This strategy has proved less successful for most human disorders which are not recessive, and where a single copy of the aberrant gene has clinically significant effects even though the normal gene product is present. An alternative approach that eliminates the impediment of a normal protein in affected individuals is to study homozygotes for the mutant allele. For virtually all dominant human disorders in which homozygotes have been described, symptoms have been significantly more severe in the homozygote than in the heterozygote. Thus, these disorders do not conform to the classical definition of dominance which states that homozygotes and heterozygotes for a defect are phenotypically indistinguishable. Instead, they display incomplete dominance, indicating that the normal allele may play a role in ameliorating the disease process. The D4S10 locus, defined by the probe G8 and linked to the gene for Huntington's disease (HD), has permitted us to identify individuals with a high probability of being homozygous for this autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. These homozygotes do not differ in clinical expression or course from typical HD heterozygotes.

Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by a toxic gain of function mutation in the huntingtin gene (Htt).

A key translational step for this approach is extension to the larger non-human primate brain, achieving sufficient distribution of small interfering RNA targeting Htt (siHtt) and levels of Htt suppression that may have therapeutic benefit. We evaluated the potential for convection enhanced delivery (CED) of siHtt to provide widespread and robust suppression of Htt in nonhuman primates. siHtt was infused continuously for 7 or 28 days into the nonhuman primate putamen to analyze effects of infusion rate and drug concentration on the volume of effective suppression. Distribution of radiolabeled siHtt and Htt suppression were quantified by autoradiography and PCR, respectively, in tissue punches. Histopathology was evaluated and Htt suppression was also visualized in animals treated for 28 days. Seven days of CED led to widespread distribution of siHtt and significant Htt silencing throughout the nonhuman primate striatum in an infusion rate and dose dependent manner. Htt suppression at therapeutic dose levels was well tolerated by the brain. A model developed from these results predicts that continuous CED of siHtt can achieve significant coverage of the striatum of Huntington's disease patients.

Variable penetrance for alleles carrying 36-39 repeats has been noted, but the disease appears fully penetrant when the repeat numbers are >40. An abnormal CAG repeat may expand, contract, or be stably transmitted when passed from parent to child. Assays used to diagnose Huntington disease must be optimized to ensure the accurate and unambiguous quantitation of CAG repeat length.

Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by gradual deterioration of motor and cognitive functions and development of psychiatric deficits. Animal models provide powerful means to study the pathological processes, molecular dysfunctions and symptoms associated with HD. We performed a longitudinal behavioral study of the newly developed HdhQ350/+ mouse line, a knock-in model that expresses a repeat of 350 glutamines. We found remarkable sex-dependent differences on symptom onset and severity. While both sexes lose weight and grip strength, only HdhQ350/+ males have impaired motor coordination as measured by the rotarod and alterations in gait as measured by the catwalk assay. While HdhQ350/+ females do not exhibit impairment in motor coordination, we found a reduction in dark phase locomotor activity. Male and female HdhQ350/+ mice do not show anxiety as measured by the elevated plus maze or changes in exploration as measured by the open field test. To investigate these sex-dependent differences, we performed western blot analyses of striatal tissue. We measured equal mutant huntingtin protein expression in both sexes and found evidence of aggregation. We found the expected decrease of DARPP-32 expression only in female HdhQ350/+ mice. Remarkably, we found no evidence of reduction in synaptophysin or CB1 receptors in HdhQ350/+ tissue of either sex. Our study indicates that male and female HdhQ350/+ mice differentially recapitulate select behavioral impairments commonly measured in other HD mouse models with limited sex-dependent changes in recognized histopathological markers. We conclude that expanded polyglutamine repeats influence HD pathogenesis in a sex-dependent manner."

Accumulating evidence highlights the potential role of mixed proteinopathies (i.e., abnormal protein aggregation) in the development of clinical manifestations of neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited NDD caused by autosomal-dominant expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat mutation in the gene coding for Huntingtin (Htt). Previous studies have suggested the coexistence of phosphorylated-Tau, \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions in HD. However, definite evidence that HD pathology in humans can be accompanied by other proteinopathies is still lacking. Using human post-mortem putamen samples from 31 controls and 56 HD individuals, we performed biochemical analyses of the expression, oligomerization and aggregation of Tau, \u03b1-Syn, TDP-43, and Amyloid precursor protein (APP)/A\u03b2. In HD brain, we observed reduced soluble protein (but not mRNA) levels of Htt, \u03b1-Syn, and Tau. Our results also support abnormal phosphorylation of Tau in more advanced stages of disease. Aberrant splicing of Tau exons 2, 3 (exclusion) and 10 (inclusion) was also detected in HD patients, leading to higher 0N4R and lower 1N3R isoforms. Finally, following formic acid extraction, we observed increased aggregation of TDP-43, \u03b1-Syn, and phosphorylated-Tau during HD progression. Notably, we observed that 88% of HD patients with Vonsattel grade 4 neuropathology displayed at least one non-Htt proteinopathy compared to 29% in controls. Interestingly, \u03b1-Syn aggregation correlated with Htt, TDP-43 and phosphorylated-Tau in HD but not in controls. The impact of this work is twofold: (1) it provides compelling evidences that Tau, \u03b1-Syn and TDP-43 proteinopathies are increased in HD, and (2) it suggests the involvement of common mechanisms leading to abnormal accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins in NDD. Further studies will be needed to decipher the impact of these proteinopathies on clinical manifestation of HD."

INTRODUCTION An Amyand's hernia is a heterogeneous clinical condition defined by the presence of the vermiform appendix within an inguinal hernia sac, which may or may not contain other abdominal contents or pathologic inflammatory changes. Herein we present an exceptionally rare case of an Amyand's hernia containing acute appendicitis and a perforated cecum. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 46-year-old male with a right inguinal hernia of 2-3 year duration presented to our Emergency Department complaining of acute onset abdominal and groin pain. The patient was diagnosed with an incarcerated right inguinal hernia and underwent emergent surgical repair. Intraoperatively a reactive fluid was found within the hernia sac that prompted an exploratory laparotomy for suspected bowel perforation. The hernia was then found to contain an inflamed gangrenous appendix with an inflamed and perforated cecum. An ileocecectomy and enteroenterostomy was performed and the hernia defect was repaired without mesh. DISCUSSION With an estimated incidence of only 1%, Amyand's hernias are rare and lack a clear evidence-based management scheme. Moreover, they can contain a diverse range of pathologic features and presentations that can complicate diagnosis and treatment. To avoid potential morbidity and mortality, the surgeon must consider an Amyand's hernia on his or her differential when operating on inguinal hernias and be aware of the associated presentations, complications, and management schemes. CONCLUSION There is a paucity of reports describing simultaneous appendicitis and cecal perforation within an Amyand's hernia. In our case, ileocecectomy and Bassini hernia repair with close follow-up led to a favorable outcome."

OBJECTIVE Although it is well known that radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer, the effect of aging and smoking with radiotherapy on incidence rate of secondary bladder cancer remains unknown. Then, this study investigated the combinational effect of external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer and aging or smoking on comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer. METHODS This study included 754 Japanese patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy (n = 319) and radical prostatectomy (n = 435) from 2000 through 2013. The relationship between therapeutic modality for prostate cancer as well as age or smoking status and comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer was examined. RESULTS During the median follow-up period of 4.3 and 3.1 years, secondary bladder cancer occurred in 11 (3.4%) and 5 (1.1%) of patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy, respectively. The 5-year bladder cancer-free survival rate was 97.3% in the external beam radiotherapy group and 99.4% in the radical prostatectomy group. Age (hazard ratio = 1.15, P = 0.027) and ever smoking (hazard ratio = 5.65, P = 0.011) were significant predictive factors of secondary bladder cancer incidence in the external beam radiotherapy cohort, but not in the radical prostatectomy cohort. Inversely, among men with ever smoking, but not among older men, external beam radiotherapy (hazard ratio = 9.64, P = 0.0052) was a significant risk factor of secondary bladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these findings suggest that smoking history might be one of criteria to choose radical prostatectomy than external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and that age would not be a criterion for therapeutic selection in terms of secondary bladder cancer."

MATERIAL AND METHODS The cohort included low-risk patients and a selection of \"favourable-intermediate\" risk patients. All patients were homogeneously treated using an intraoperative dynamic planning prostate brachytherapy technique, with loose 125-iodine seeds and a prescription dose of 145Gy. The mean follow-up was 132 months. RESULTS The 10-year overall survival for the entire cohort was 92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90-94). The 10-year relapse-free survival rate was 82% (95% CI: 79-85). Overall, 61 second cancers were registered. When comparing with a matched general French population, the standard incidence ratio (SIR) for bladder cancer was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.46-1.93). For colorectal cancer, the SIR was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.19-0.89). For lung cancer, the SIR was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.17-0.76). The SIR for all cancers was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47-0.79). When excluding secondary colorectal and lung cancers (both with low SIRs in this series), the SIR for all cancers was 1.06 (95% CI: 0.77-1.29). CONCLUSION With a mean follow-up of more than 11 years, this series does not detect any excess risk of second cancers associated with permanent implant prostate brachytherapy. However, due to power limitation, a small increase in the risk of secondary malignancies cannot be totally ruled out."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men and remains the second most lethal malignancy. Most patients undergoing treatment elect for radical prostatectomy or radiation. As the number of patients treated has increased and survival improved, delayed complications of these modalities has assumed increased importance. Recent studies report an increased risk of certain cancers after radiation for prostate cancer. This review aims to summarize recent data. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies have confirmed the association of prostate radiation with secondary cancers. The most common secondary malignancy is bladder carcinoma. We have treated 44 patients with bladder cancer who had radiation therapy for prostate cancer. At diagnosis, 60% had tumor, which invaded the bladder muscle (T2 or greater disease). The mean latency from radiation to diagnosis of bladder cancer was 5.5 years. SUMMARY Radiation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. In our series, patients presented at higher stage than expected from population-based studies of bladder cancer. Patients and their physicians should be aware of such risks when choosing therapy for prostate cancer. Hematuria following radiation therapy for prostate cancer should be investigated rather than being attributed to radiation-induced cystitis."

Based on the data in the literature, there is a consistently increased risk of bladder cancer (HR: 1.67, 95% CI 1.55-1.80), rectal cancer (HR: 1.79, 95% CI 1.34-2.38), and colorectal cancer (HR: 1.79, 95% CI 1.34-23.8) following percutaneous radiation therapy.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To estimate the risks of radiation-induced rectal and bladder cancers following low dose rate (LDR) and high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy as monotherapy for localised prostate cancer and compare to external beam radiotherapy techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS LDR and HDR brachytherapy monotherapy plans were generated for three prostate CT datasets. Second cancer risks were assessed using Schneider's concept of organ equivalent dose. LDR risks were assessed according to a mechanistic model and a bell-shaped model. HDR risks were assessed according to a bell-shaped model. Relative risks and excess absolute risks were estimated and compared to external beam techniques. RESULTS Excess absolute risks of second rectal or bladder cancer were low for both LDR (irrespective of the model used for calculation) and HDR techniques. Average excess absolute risks of rectal cancer for LDR brachytherapy according to the mechanistic model were 0.71 per 10,000 person-years (PY) and 0.84 per 10,000 PY respectively, and according to the bell-shaped model, were 0.47 and 0.78 per 10,000 PY respectively. For HDR, the average excess absolute risks for second rectal and bladder cancers were 0.74 and 1.62 per 10,000 PY respectively. The absolute differences between techniques were very low and clinically irrelevant. Compared to external beam prostate radiotherapy techniques, LDR and HDR brachytherapy resulted in the lowest risks of second rectal and bladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS This study shows both LDR and HDR brachytherapy monotherapy result in low estimated risks of radiation-induced rectal and bladder cancer. LDR resulted in lower bladder cancer risks than HDR, and lower or similar risks of rectal cancer. In absolute terms these differences between techniques were very small. Compared to external beam techniques, second rectal and bladder cancer risks were lowest for brachytherapy."

OBJECTIVE To determine the association between exposure to radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer and subsequent second malignancies (second primary cancers). DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. DATA SOURCES Medline and Embase up to 6 April 2015 with no restrictions on year or language. STUDY SELECTION Comparative studies assessing the risk of second malignancies in patients exposed or unexposed to radiotherapy in the course of treatment for prostate cancer were selected by two reviewers independently with any disagreement resolved by consensus. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics and outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Outcomes were synthesized with random effects models and Mantel-Haenszel weighting. Unadjusted odds ratios and multivariable adjusted hazard ratios, when available, were pooled. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Second cancers of the bladder, colorectal tract, rectum, lung, and hematologic system. RESULTS Of 3056 references retrieved, 21 studies were selected for analysis. Most included studies were large multi-institutional reports but had moderate risk of bias. The most common type of radiotherapy was external beam; 13 studies used patients treated with surgery as controls and eight used patients who did not undergo radiotherapy as controls. The length of follow-up among studies varied. There was increased risk of cancers of the bladder (four studies; adjusted hazard ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.55 to 1.80), colorectum (three studies; 1.79, 1.34 to 2.38), and rectum (three studies; 1.79, 1.34 to 2.38), but not cancers of the hematologic system (one study; 1.64, 0.90 to 2.99) or lung (two studies; 1.45, 0.70 to 3.01), after radiotherapy compared with the risk in those unexposed to radiotherapy. The odds of a second cancer varied depending on type of radiotherapy: treatment with external beam radiotherapy was consistently associated with increased odds while brachytherapy was not. Among the patients who underwent radiotherapy, from individual studies, the highest absolute rates reported for bladder, colorectal, and rectal cancers were 3.8%, 4.2%, and 1.2%, respectively, while the lowest reported rates were 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.3%. CONCLUSION Radiotherapy for prostate cancer was associated with higher risks of developing second malignancies of the bladder, colon, and rectum compared with patients unexposed to radiotherapy, but the reported absolute rates were low. Further studies with longer follow-up are required to confirm these findings."

PURPOSE Pre-prostate specific antigen era series demonstrated an increased risk of bladder cancer and rectal cancer in men who received radiotherapy for prostate cancer. We estimated the risk of secondary bladder cancer and rectal cancer after prostate radiotherapy using a contemporary population based cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified 243,082 men in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database who underwent radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer between 1988 and 2003. We estimated the incidence rate, standardized incidence ratio and age adjusted incidence rate ratio of subsequent bladder cancer and rectal cancer associated with radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and a combination of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. RESULTS The relative risk of bladder cancer developing after external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy compared to radical prostatectomy was 1.88, 1.52 and 1.85, respectively. Compared to the general United States population the standardized incidence ratio for bladder cancer developing after radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy was 0.99, 1.42, 1.10 and 1.39, respectively. The relative risk of rectal cancer developing after external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy compared to radical prostatectomy was 1.26, 1.08 and 1.21, respectively. The standardized incidence ratio for rectal cancer developing after radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy was 0.91, 0.99, 0.68 and 0.86, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Men who receive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer have an increased risk of bladder cancer compared to patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and compared to the general population. The risk of rectal cancer is increased in patients who receive external beam radiotherapy compared to radical prostatectomy. Patients should be counseled appropriately regarding these risks."

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the risk of BlCa developing after radiation for PCa, stratified by ethnicity and follow-up duration. METHODS The 1973-2011 surveillance, epidemiology and end results database was used to determine the observed and expected number of BlCa after PCa radiation. The adjusted relative risks (RRs) of developing BlCa were calculated for the various radiation modalities relative to no radiation, stratified by ethnicity and follow-up duration. BlCa characteristics were compared between patients with a history of prostate radiation and those without PCa. RESULTS PCa was radiated in 346,429 men, 6401 of whom developed BlCa versus 2464 expected cases [SIR (95 % CI) of 2.60 (2.53-2.66)]. All radiation modalities were found to have an increased RR of developing BlCa after 10 years, with brachytherapy having a significantly higher RR than external beam radiation (EBRT) or combined EBRT and brachytherapy in Caucasian men and a significantly higher RR than EBRT in men of other/unknown ethnicity. Post-radiation BlCa, in particular that after brachytherapy, had higher grade (P = 0.0001) and lower stage (P = 0.0001) versus the general population. CONCLUSIONS The increased risk of BlCa after prostate radiation occurs predominantly after 10 years, regardless of ethnicity. The RR of developing BlCa after 10 years is significantly higher following brachytherapy than after EBRT or EBRT and brachytherapy. Bladder cancers after prostate radiation, especially after brachytherapy, are generally lower stage but higher grade than those in patients without PCa."

BACKGROUND Long-term survival can be achieved in patients affected by localized prostate cancer (PCa) treated with either radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). However, development of a second primary tumor is still poorly investigated. OBJECTIVE To investigate the impact of RP and EBRT on subsequent risk of developing bladder (BCa) and/or rectal cancer (RCa) among PCa survivors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 84397 patients diagnosed with localized PCa, treated with RP or EBRT between 1988 and 2009, and older than 65 yr of age were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare insurance program-linked database. Our primary objective was to investigate the effect of EBRT and RP on the second primary BCa and RCa incidence. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Multivariable competing-risk regression analyses were performed to assess the risk of developing a second primary BCa or RCa. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Of the 84397 individuals included in the study, 33252 (39%) were treated with RP and 51145 (61%) with EBRT. Median follow-up was 69 months, and follow-up periods for patients who did not develop BCa, RCa, or pelvic cancer were 68, 69, and 68 mo, respectively. A total of 1660 individuals developed pelvic tumors (1236 BCa and 432 RCa). The 5- and 10-yr cumulative BCa incidence rates were 0.75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64-0.85%) and 1.63% (95% CI: 1.45-1.80%) versus 1.26% (95% CI: 1.15-1.37%) and 2.34% (95% CI: 2.16-2.53%) for patients treated with RP versus EBRT, respectively. The 5- and 10-yr cumulative RCa incidence rates were 0.32% (95% CI: 0.25-0.39%) and 0.73% (95% CI: 0.61-0.85%) versus 0.36% (95% CI: 0.30-0.41%) and 0.69% (95% CI: 0.60-0.79%) for patients treated with RP versus EBRT, respectively. On multivariable competing risk regression analyses, treatment with EBRT was independently associated with the risk of developing a second primary BCa (hazard ratio: 1.35, CI: 1.18-1.55; p<0.001), but not RCa (p=0.4). Limitations include lack of information regarding the dose of radiotherapy and the retrospective nature with the implicit risk of selection bias. CONCLUSIONS Patients treated with EBRT are at increased risk of developing a second primary BCa compared with those treated with RP. However, no differences were found considering RCa incidence in patients treated with RP or EBRT within the first 5 yr after primary therapy. These results need to be validated in a well-designed randomized prospective trial. PATIENT SUMMARY We retrospectively analyzed the risk of developing a second primary bladder or rectal cancer during follow-up for patients treated with radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy for a localized prostate cancer. We found that those treated with external beam radiotherapy are at an increased risk of developing a second primary bladder cancer tumor."

The classical X shape of mitotic human chromosomes is the consequence of two distinct waves of cohesin removal. First, during prophase and prometaphase, the bulk of cohesin is driven from chromosome arms by the cohesin antagonist WAPL. This arm-specific cohesin removal is referred to as the prophase pathway [1-4]. The subsequent cleavage of the remaining centromeric cohesin by Separase is known to be the trigger for anaphase onset [5-7]. Remarkably the biological purpose of the prophase pathway is unknown. We find that this pathway is essential for two key mitotic processes. First, it is important to focus Aurora B at centromeres to allow efficient correction of erroneous microtubule-kinetochore attachments. In addition, it is required to facilitate the timely decatenation of sister chromatids. As a consequence, WAPL-depleted cells undergo anaphase with segregation errors, including both lagging chromosomes and catenanes, resulting in micronuclei and DNA damage. Stable WAPL depletion arrests cells in a p53-dependent manner but causes p53-deficient cells to become highly aneuploid. Our data show that the WAPL-dependent prophase pathway is essential for proper chromosome segregation and is crucial to maintain genomic integrity."

The cohesin complex topologically encircles chromosomes and mediates sister chromatid cohesion to ensure accurate chromosome segregation upon cell division. Cohesin also participates in DNA repair and gene transcription. The Nipped-B-Mau2 protein complex loads cohesin onto chromosomes and the Pds5-Wapl complex removes cohesin. Pds5 is also essential for sister chromatid cohesion, indicating that it has functions beyond cohesin removal. The Brca2 DNA repair protein interacts with Pds5, but the roles of this complex beyond DNA repair are unknown. Here we show that Brca2 opposes Pds5 function in sister chromatid cohesion by assaying precocious sister chromatid separation in metaphase spreads of cultured cells depleted for these proteins. By genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation we find that Pds5 facilitates SA cohesin subunit association with DNA replication origins and that Brca2 inhibits SA binding, mirroring their effects on sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesin binding is maximal at replication origins and extends outward to occupy active genes and regulatory sequences. Pds5 and Wapl, but not Brca2, limit the distance that cohesin extends from origins, thereby determining which active genes, enhancers and silencers bind cohesin. Using RNA-seq we find that Brca2, Pds5 and Wapl influence the expression of most genes sensitive to Nipped-B and cohesin, largely in the same direction. These findings demonstrate that Brca2 regulates sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression in addition to its canonical role in DNA repair and expand the known functions of accessory proteins in cohesin's diverse functions."

It has been proposed that cohesin forms TADs and loops by extruding chromatin loops until it encounters CTCF, but direct evidence for this hypothesis is missing. Here, we show that cohesin suppresses compartments but is required for TADs and loops, that CTCF defines their boundaries, and that the cohesin unloading factor WAPL and its PDS5 binding partners control the length of loops. In the absence of WAPL and PDS5 proteins, cohesin forms extended loops, presumably by passing CTCF sites, accumulates in axial chromosomal positions (vermicelli), and condenses chromosomes. Unexpectedly, PDS5 proteins are also required for boundary function. These results show that cohesin has an essential genome-wide function in mediating long-range chromatin interactions and support the hypothesis that cohesin creates these by loop extrusion, until it is delayed by CTCF in a manner dependent on PDS5 proteins, or until it is released from DNA by WAPL."

Mammalian genomes are spatially organized by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin into chromatin loops and topologically associated domains, which have important roles in gene regulation and recombination. By binding to specific sequences, CTCF defines contact points for cohesin-mediated long-range chromosomal cis-interactions. Cohesin is also present at these sites, but has been proposed to be loaded onto DNA elsewhere and to extrude chromatin loops until it encounters CTCF bound to DNA. How cohesin is recruited to CTCF sites, according to this or other models, is unknown. Here we show that the distribution of cohesin in the mouse genome depends on transcription, CTCF and the cohesin release factor Wings apart-like (Wapl). In CTCF-depleted fibroblasts, cohesin cannot be properly recruited to CTCF sites but instead accumulates at transcription start sites of active genes, where the cohesin-loading complex is located. In the absence of both CTCF and Wapl, cohesin accumulates in up to 70 kilobase-long regions at 3'-ends of active genes, in particular if these converge on each other. Changing gene expression modulates the position of these 'cohesin islands'. These findings indicate that transcription can relocate mammalian cohesin over long distances on DNA, as previously reported for yeast cohesin, that this translocation contributes to positioning cohesin at CTCF sites, and that active genes can be freed from cohesin either by transcription-mediated translocation or by Wapl-mediated release."

BACKGROUND The linkage between duplicated chromosomes (sister chromatids) is established during S phase by the action of cohesin, a multisubunit complex conserved from yeast to humans. Most cohesin dissociates from chromosome arms when the cell enters mitotic prophase, leading to the formation of metaphase chromosomes with two cytologically discernible chromatids. This process is known as sister-chromatid resolution. Although two mitotic kinases have been implicated in this process, it remains unknown exactly how the cohesin-mediated linkage is destabilized at a mechanistic level. RESULTS The wings apart-like (Wapl) protein was originally identified as a gene product that potentially regulates heterochromatin organization in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that the human ortholog of Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that facilitates cohesin's timely release from chromosome arms during prophase. Depletion of Wapl from HeLa cells causes transient accumulation of prometaphase-like cells with chromosomes that display poorly resolved sister chromatids with a high level of cohesin. Reduction of cohesin relieves the Wapl-depletion phenotype, and depletion of Wapl rescues premature sister separation observed in Sgo1-depleted or Esco2-depleted cells. Conversely, overexpression of Wapl causes premature separation of sister chromatids. Wapl physically associates with cohesin in HeLa-cell nuclear extracts. Remarkably, in vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrate that Wapl forms a stoichiometric, ternary complex with two regulatory subunits of cohesin, implicating its noncatalytic function in inactivating cohesin's ability to interact with chromatin. CONCLUSIONS Wapl is a new regulator of sister chromatid resolution and promotes release of cohesin from chromosomes by directly interacting with its regulatory subunits."

Wapl protein regulates binding of the cohesin complex to chromosomes during interphase and helps remove cohesin from chromosomes at mitosis. We isolated a dominant mutation in wapl (wapl(AG)) in a screen for mutations that counteract silencing mediated by an engrailed Polycomb-group response element. wapl(AG) hemizygotes die as pharate adults and have an extra sex combs phenotype characteristic of males with mutations in Polycomb-group (PcG) genes. The wapl gene encodes two proteins, a long form and a short form. wapl(AG) introduces a stop codon at amino acid 271 of the long form and produces a truncated protein. The expression of a transgene encoding the truncated Wapl-AG protein causes an extra-sex-comb phenotype similar to that seen in the wapl(AG) mutant. Mutations in the cohesin-associated genes Nipped-B and pds5 suppress and enhance wapl(AG) phenotypes, respectively. A Pds5-Wapl complex (releasin) removes cohesin from DNA, while Nipped-B loads cohesin. This suggests that Wapl-AG might exert its effects through changes in cohesin binding. Consistent with this model, Wapl-AG was found to increase the stability of cohesin binding to polytene chromosomes.

How this is achieved is poorly understood. Here, we show that the interaction between cohesin and chromatin is controlled by Wapl, a protein implicated in heterochromatin formation and tumorigenesis. Wapl is associated with cohesin throughout the cell cycle, and its depletion blocks cohesin dissociation from chromosomes during the early stages of mitosis and prevents the resolution of sister chromatids until anaphase, which occurs after a delay. Wapl depletion also increases the residence time of cohesin on chromatin in interphase.

The normal adult human mammary gland is a continuous bilayered epithelial system. Bipotent and myoepithelial progenitors are prominent and unique components of the outer (basal) layer. The inner (luminal) layer includes both luminal-restricted progenitors and a phenotypically separable fraction that lacks progenitor activity. We now report an epigenomic comparison of these three subsets with one another, with their associated stromal cells, and with three immortalized, non-tumorigenic human mammary cell lines. Each genome-wide analysis contains profiles for six histone marks, methylated DNA, and RNA transcripts. Analysis of these datasets shows that each cell type has unique features, primarily within genomic regulatory regions, and that the cell lines group together. Analyses of the promoter and enhancer profiles place the luminal progenitors in between the basal cells and the non-progenitor luminal subset. Integrative analysis reveals networks of subset-specific transcription factors."

Although certain chromatin features, such as the histone acetyltransferase P300 and the histone modification H3K4me1, indicate the presence of enhancers, only a fraction of enhancers are functionally active. Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers. However, the systematic identification of the most informative single modification, or combination thereof, is still lacking. Furthermore, the discovery of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) provides an alternative approach to directly predicting enhancer activity. However, it remains challenging to link chromatin modifications to eRNA transcription. Herein, we develop a logistic regression model to unravel the relationship between chromatin modifications and eRNA synthesis. We perform a systematic assessment of 24 chromatin modifications in fetal lung fibroblast and demonstrate that a combination of four modifications is sufficient to accurately predict eRNA transcription. Furthermore, we compare the ability of eRNAs and H3K27ac to discriminate enhancer activity. We demonstrate that eRNA is more indicative of enhancer activity. Finally, we apply our fibroblast trained model to six other cell-types and successfully predict eRNA synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate the learned relationships are general and independent of cell-type. We provided a powerful tool to identify active enhancers and reveal the relationship between chromatin modifications, eRNA production and enhancer activity."

Using immunoprecipitation of in vivo formaldehyde-fixed chromatin in phenotypically diverse cultured cell lines, we have mapped PRC1 components, the histone methyl transferase (HMT) Enhancer of zeste (E(z)) and histone H3 modifications in active and inactive PcG-controlled regions. We show that PRC1 components are present in both cases, but at different levels. In particular, active target promoters are nearly devoid of E(z) and Polycomb.

BACKGROUND Transcription regulation in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells is a complex process that involves multitude of regulatory layers, one of which is post-translational modification of histones. Acetylation of specific lysine residues of histones plays a key role in regulating gene expression. RESULTS Here we have investigated the genome-wide occurrence of two histone marks, acetylation of histone H3K9 and K14 (H3K9ac and H3K14ac), in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. Genome-wide H3K9ac and H3K14ac show very high correlation between each other as well as with other histone marks (such as H3K4me3) suggesting a coordinated regulation of active histone marks. Moreover, the levels of H3K9ac and H3K14ac directly correlate with the CpG content of the promoters attesting the importance of sequences underlying the specifically modified nucleosomes. Our data provide evidence that H3K9ac and H3K14ac are also present over the previously described bivalent promoters, along with H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. Furthermore, like H3K27ac, H3K9ac and H3K14ac can also differentiate active enhancers from inactive ones. Although, H3K9ac and H3K14ac, a hallmark of gene activation exhibit remarkable correlation over active and bivalent promoters as well as distal regulatory elements, a subset of inactive promoters is selectively enriched for H3K14ac. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that chromatin modifications, such as H3K9ac and H3K14ac, are part of the active promoter state, are present over bivalent promoters and active enhancers and that the extent of H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation could be driven by cis regulatory elements such as CpG content at promoters. Our study also suggests that a subset of inactive promoters is selectively and specifically enriched for H3K14ac. This observation suggests that histone acetyl transferases (HATs) prime inactive genes by H3K14ac for stimuli dependent activation. In conclusion our study demonstrates a wider role for H3K9ac and H3K14ac in gene regulation than originally thought."

Enhancer activation is a critical step for gene activation. Here we report an epigenetic crosstalk at enhancers between the UTX (H3K27 demethylase)-MLL4 (H3K4 methyltransferase) complex and the histone acetyltransferase p300. We demonstrate that UTX, in a demethylase activity-independent manner, facilitates conversion of inactive enhancers in embryonic stem cells to an active (H3K4me1+/H3K27ac+) state by recruiting and coupling the enzymatic functions of MLL4 and p300. Loss of UTX leads to attenuated enhancer activity, characterized by reduced levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac as well as impaired transcription. The UTX-MLL4 complex enhances p300-dependent H3K27 acetylation through UTX-dependent stimulation of p300 recruitment, while MLL4-mediated H3K4 monomethylation, reciprocally, requires p300 function. Importantly, MLL4-generated H3K4me1 further enhances p300-dependent transcription. This work reveals a previously unrecognized cooperativity among enhancer-associated chromatin modulators, including a unique function for UTX, in establishing an \"active enhancer landscape\" and defines a detailed mechanism for the joint deposition of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac."

BACKGROUND Transcriptional regulation in multi-cellular organisms is a complex process involving multiple modular regulatory elements for each gene. Building whole-genome models of transcriptional networks requires mapping all relevant enhancers and then linking them to target genes. Previous methods of enhancer identification based either on sequence information or on epigenetic marks have different limitations stemming from incompleteness of each of these datasets taken separately. RESULTS In this work we present a new approach for discovery of regulatory elements based on the combination of sequence motifs and epigenetic marks measured with ChIP-Seq. Our method uses supervised learning approaches to train a model describing the dependence of enhancer activity on sequence features and histone marks. Our results indicate that using combination of features provides superior results to previous approaches based on either one of the datasets. While histone modifications remain the dominant feature for accurate predictions, the models based on sequence motifs have advantages in their general applicability to different tissues. Additionally, we assess the relevance of different sequence motifs in prediction accuracy showing that even tissue-specific enhancer activity depends on multiple motifs. CONCLUSIONS Based on our results, we conclude that it is worthwhile to include sequence motif data into computational approaches to active enhancer prediction and also that classifiers trained on a specific set of enhancers can generalize with significant accuracy beyond the training set."

Cell-fate transitions involve the integration of genomic information encoded by regulatory elements, such as enhancers, with the cellular environment. However, identification of genomic sequences that control human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge. Here we show that in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), unique chromatin signatures identify two distinct classes of genomic elements, both of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300 and BRG1, monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and low nucleosomal density. In addition, elements of the first class are distinguished by the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), overlap with previously characterized hESC enhancers, and are located proximally to genes expressed in hESCs and the epiblast. In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term 'poised enhancers', are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation. Consistent with the poised identity, during differentiation of hESCs to neuroepithelium, a neuroectoderm-specific subset of poised enhancers acquires a chromatin signature associated with active enhancers. When assayed in zebrafish embryos, poised enhancers are able to direct cell-type and stage-specific expression characteristic of their proximal developmental gene, even in the absence of sequence conservation in the fish genome. Our data demonstrate that early developmental enhancers are epigenetically pre-marked in hESCs and indicate an unappreciated role of H3K27me3 at distal regulatory elements. Moreover, the wealth of new regulatory sequences identified here provides an invaluable resource for studies and isolation of transient, rare cell populations representing early stages of human embryogenesis."

Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently, there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a \"ground state\" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and included in the final spliced mRNA have distinct nucleosome profiles in comparison to exons not included at exon-exon junctions. Genes marked by the active modification H3K4m3 are characterized by lower nucleosome occupancy before the transcription start site compared to genes marked by the inactive modification H3K27m3, while bivalent domains, genes associated with both marks, lie exactly in the middle. Combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks (chromatin states) are associated with unique nucleosome profiles. Nucleosome organization varies around transcription factor binding in enhancers versus promoters. DNA methylation is associated with increasing nucleosome occupancy and different types of methylations have distinct location preferences within the nucleosome core particle. Finally, computational analysis of nucleosome organization alone is sufficient to elucidate much of the circuitry of pluripotency. Our results, suggest that nucleosome organization is associated with numerous genomic and epigenomic processes and can be used to elucidate cellular identity."

Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs.

BACKGROUND Regulated gene expression controls organismal development, and variation in regulatory patterns has been implicated in complex traits. Thus accurate prediction of enhancers is important for further understanding of these processes. Genome-wide measurement of epigenetic features, such as histone modifications and occupancy by transcription factors, is improving enhancer predictions, but the contribution of these features to prediction accuracy is not known. Given the importance of the hematopoietic transcription factor TAL1 for erythroid gene activation, we predicted candidate enhancers based on genomic occupancy by TAL1 and measured their activity. Contributions of multiple features to enhancer prediction were evaluated based on the results of these and other studies. RESULTS TAL1-bound DNA segments were active enhancers at a high rate both in transient transfections of cultured cells (39 of 79, or 56%) and transgenic mice (43 of 66, or 65%). The level of binding signal for TAL1 or GATA1 did not help distinguish TAL1-bound DNA segments as active versus inactive enhancers, nor did the density of regulation-related histone modifications. A meta-analysis of results from this and other studies (273 tested predicted enhancers) showed that the presence of TAL1, GATA1, EP300, SMAD1, H3K4 methylation, H3K27ac, and CAGE tags at DNase hypersensitive sites gave the most accurate predictors of enhancer activity, with a success rate over 80% and a median threefold increase in activity. Chromatin accessibility assays and the histone modifications H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were sensitive for finding enhancers, but they have high false positive rates unless transcription factor occupancy is also included. CONCLUSIONS Occupancy by key transcription factors such as TAL1, GATA1, SMAD1, and EP300, along with evidence of transcription, improves the accuracy of enhancer predictions based on epigenetic features."

Jaundice is a clinical manifestation of disorders of underlying bilirubin metabolism, hepatocellular dysfunction, or biliary obstruction. As clinical presentations of yellowing of eyes or skin can be somewhat nonspecific for the underlying etiology of disease, a stepwise approach to evaluation is necessary for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plan. In this review, we discuss underlying mechanisms of cholestasis and jaundice as well as laboratory and imaging modalities needed to evaluate a patient presenting with hyperbilirubinemia. Jaundice occurs in settings of cholestasis or inability to effectively secrete bile as well as disorders of bilirubin metabolism and hepatocellular dysfunction. Clinical signs of jaundice occur when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.5 to 3 mg/dL. In all cases, evaluation begins with liver chemistry tests which include bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total protein. In patients with hepatobiliary causes of jaundice, the alkaline phosphatase is usually elevated. In these cases, evaluation of hepatic synthetic function is crucial to the formulation of a treatment plant. When serologic evaluation is combined with hepatobiliary imaging, underlying mechanism of disease can often be elucidated. A stepwise approach to evaluation can be cost and time saving as well as a framework to improve patient outcomes. In this review, we will outline a diagnostic approach to jaundice, beginning with pathophysiology of cholestasis followed by hyperbilirubinemia and markers of synthetic dysfunction."

The presence of abnormal amounts of bilirubin in the blood stream and skin, usually referred to as hyperbilirubinemia, is associated with a wide range of pathologies that can pose considerable risks for human health. The early and effective screening of the severity degrees of this medical condition can play an important role on the selection of the appropriate treatment for the associated pathologies. This, in turn, can minimize the need for more aggressive and costly therapeutic interventions which can themselves pose considerable risks for morbidity and mortality. The current noninvasive protocols used to differentiate these severity degrees, however, are hindered by the relatively limited knowledge about the impact of different amounts of extravascular bilirubin on skin spectral responses and on the onset of jaundice, the resulting yellow-tinted skin appearance. In this paper, we address this open problem through controlled in silico experiments supported by measured data provided in the related literature. Our experimental findings bring biophysically-based insights to bear on the clarification of this biomedical entanglement, and unveil optical features that can potentially lead to more effective screening protocols for the noninvasive differentiation and monitoring of variable degrees of hyperbilirubinemia severity."

Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies. The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, which indicates that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis."

Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II is caused by mutations in the UGT1A1 gene resulting in severely reduced hepatic activity of UDP-glucoronyltransferase - an enzyme required to convert bilirubin into a more soluble form that can then be removed from the body. Absence or severe deficiency of this enzyme can lead to bilirubin accumulation in the body resulting in yellow skin and eyes (jaundice). The earliest signs of this disease can be apparent in the neonatal period. Patients with Crigglar-Najjar syndrome type II respond to phenobarbital therapy which decreases their chances of getting bilirubinemia by 60-70% in 3 weeks. A 17 years old boy presented with the complaint of gastroenteritis. On examination, he was jaundiced and his parents reported that it has been present since birth. He was admitted in the hospital with the differential diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome, but later it was found that the unconjugated bilirubin levels were higher than those required for Gilbert's criteria. We report, herein, an extremely rare case of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II and how the patient responded to phenobarbital therapy. Periods of fasting, stress and any kind of illness can worsen unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia leading to complications like kernicterus, so higher levels of unconjugated bilirubin should be addressed immediately and the patient along with his/her family should be educated about this disease."

Intact mass and subunit analysis revealed a size of about 126 kDa for both biologicals. Similar glycoprotein species for the complete monomer and the Fc domain of originator and follow-on product were observed, however, small differences in lysine variants and oxidation were found. N-Glycopeptide analysis with UHPLC-QTOF-MSE confirmed the N-glycosylation sites (N149, N171 and N317) as well as Fc-specific glycosylation on N317, and TNFR-specific highly sialylated glycans on N149 and N171 on both investigated products. Small quantitative variations in the N-glycan profile were detected, although the N-glycans were qualitatively similar. Four different O-glycopeptides bearing core 1-type glycans were detected. For both, N- and O-glycopeptide analysis, determination was achieved without prior cleavage of the sialic acid residues for the first time. In addition, ion mobility spectrometry data confirmed close similarity of higher-order structure of both biologics. Furthermore, a neutralization assay, investigating the impact of altered PTMs on potency, indicated that the differences within all batches are still in the acceptable range for biosimilarity."

Previous studies have demonstrated that infarction volumes caused by transient cerebral ischemia were greater in diabetic rats than in nondiabetic rats. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is a proinflammatory protein produced in the brain in response to cerebral ischemia that promotes apoptosis. Etanercept (ETN), a recombinant TNF receptor (p75)-Fc fusion protein, competitively inhibits TNF-\u03b1. Therefore, we evaluated the neuroprotective effects of chronic or acute treatment with ETN on cerebral injury caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/Re) in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of ETN against the apoptosis and myeloperoxidase activity. Single administration of ETN before MCAO significantly suppressed exacerbation of cerebral damage in nondiabetic rats, as assessed by infarct volume. In contrast, the diabetic state markedly aggravated MCAO/Re-induced cerebral damage despite ETN treatment within 24 h before MCAO. However, the damage was improved by repeated administration of ETN at 900 \u03bcg/kg/daily in rats in an induced diabetic state. These results suggested that repeated administration of ETN can prevent exacerbation of cerebral ischemic injury in the diabetic state and is mainly attributed to anti-inflammatory effects."

Etanercept is a highly glycosylated therapeutic Fc-fusion protein that contains multiple N- and O-glycosylation sites. An in-depth characterization of the glycosylation of etanercept was carried out using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) methods in a systematic approach in which we analyzed the N- and O-linked glycans and located the occupied O-glycosylation sites. Etanercept was first treated with peptide N-glycosidase F to release the N-glycans. The N-glycan pool was labeled with a 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) fluorescence tag and separated using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (UPLC-HILIC). Preliminary structures were assigned using Glycobase. These assignments, which included monosaccharide sequence and linkage information, were confirmed by exoglycosidase array digestions of aliquots of the N-glycan pool. The removal of the N-glycans from etanercept facilitated the selective characterization of O-glycopeptides and enabled the O-glycans to be identified.

Etanercept (ETN) (Enbrel\u00ae) is a soluble protein that binds to, and specifically inhibits, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a proinflammatory cytokine. ETN is synthesized in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology as a fusion protein, with a fully human TNFRII ectodomain linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Successful manufacture of biologics, such as ETN, requires sophisticated process and product understanding, as well as meticulous control of operations to maintain product consistency. The objective of this evaluation was to show that the product profile of ETN drug substance (DS) has been consistent over the course of production. Multiple orthogonal biochemical analyses, which included evaluation of attributes indicative of product purity, potency, and quality, were assessed on >2,000 batches of ETN from three sites of DS manufacture, during the period 1998-2015. Based on the key quality attributes of product purity (assessed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography HPLC), binding activity (to TNF by ELISA), potency (inhibition of TNF-induced apoptosis by cell-based bioassay) and quality (N-linked oligosaccharide map), we show that the integrity of ETN DS has remained consistent over time. This consistency was maintained through three major enhancements to the initial process of manufacturing that were supported by detailed comparability assessments, and approved by the European Medicines Agency. Examination of results for all major quality attributes for ETN DS indicates a highly consistent process for over 18 years and throughout changes to the manufacturing process, without affecting safety and efficacy, as demonstrated across a wide range of clinical trials of ETN in multiple inflammatory diseases."

The aim of this study was to analyze the formation of the most relevant inflammation mediators including proteins and lipids in human fibroblasts upon inflammatory stimulation and subsequent treatment with dexamethasone, a powerful antiphlogistic drug. Label-free quantification was applied for proteome profiling, while an in-house established data-dependent analysis method based on high-resolution mass spectrometry was applied for eicosadomics. Furthermore, a set of 188 metabolites was determined by targeted analysis. The secretion of 40 proteins including cytokines, proteases, and other inflammation agonists as well as 14 proinflammatory and nine anti-inflammatory eicosanoids was found significantly induced, while several acylcarnithins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated upon inflammatory stimulation. Treatment with dexamethasone downregulated most cytokines and proteases, abrogated the formation of pro- but also anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, and restored normal levels of acylcarnithins but not of sphingomyelins. In addition, the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6, and complement C3, known to contribute to chronic inflammation, were not counter-regulated by dexamethasone. Similar findings were obtained with human mesenchymal stem cells, and results were confirmed by targeted analysis with multiple reaction monitoring. Comparative proteome profiling regarding other cells demonstrated cell-type-specific synthesis of, among others, eicosanoid-forming enzymes as well as relevant transcription factors, allowing us to better understand cell-type-specific regulation of inflammation mediators and shedding new light on the role of fibroblasts in chronic inflammation."

Methotrexate, a folate antagonist, is a potent antiinflammatory agent when used weekly in low concentrations. We examined the hypothesis that the antiphlogistic effects of methotrexate result from its capacity to promote intracellular accumulation of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) that, under conditions of cell injury, increases local adenosine release. We now present the first evidence to establish this mechanism of action in an in vivo model of inflammation, the murine air pouch model. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with either methotrexate or saline for 3-4 wk during induction of air pouches. Pharmacologically relevant doses of methotrexate increased splenocyte AICAR content, raised adenosine concentrations in exudates from carrageenan-inflamed air pouches, and markedly inhibited leukocyte accumulation in inflamed air pouches. The methotrexate-mediated reduction in leukocyte accumulation was partially reversed by injection of adenosine deaminase (ADA) into the air pouch, completely reversed by a specific adenosine A2 receptor antagonist, 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX), but not affected by an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-dipropylxanthine. Neither ADA nor DMPX affected leukocyte accumulation in the inflamed pouches of animals treated with either saline or the potent antiinflammatory steroid dexamethasone. These results indicate that methotrexate is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent, the antiphlogistic action of which is due to increased adenosine release at inflamed sites."

Sodium salicylate in all test doses did not produce any shifts in rosette-formation but lowered the number of RFC. As regards the immunodepressant activity, sodium diclofenac compares very favourably with indomethacin and sodium salicylate. Enhancement of the immunoreactivity inhibition caused by the drugs was not proportional to the increase in their antiphlogistic effects determined by the Selye model of inflammation."

BACKGROUND Today, the sun protection factor (SPF) value of sunscreen products is determined in vivo with a standardized protocol (EN ISO 24444:2010), and the measured SPF biological end point is the visible skin erythema. However, many of the sunscreen products currently available on the market have antiphlogistic ingredients, which may potentially result in an overestimated SPF of the sunscreen. AIMS To investigate the potential influence of the antiphlogistic ingredients panthenol and bisabolol in sunscreens on the determined SPF value in vivo. METHODS Formulations with different concentrations of the antiphlogistic ingredients bisabolol or panthenol were tested. As a reference, a base formulation (vehicle) without antiphlogistic ingredients was used. First, the SPF of the sunscreen formulas with and without antiphlogistic ingredients was analyzed in vitro. To investigate whether the antiphlogistic ingredient may suppress the inflammatory response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the SPF was determined in vivo. Finally, selected formulations were also analyzed in an erythema model for testing formulations on UV-induced inflammation. RESULTS It could be confirmed that no differences between the formula with and that without the active antiphlogistic ingredients bisabolol or panthenol exist when measured in vitro. However, there was also no statistically significant difference in the erythemal response between the vehicle (without an antiphlogistic active ingredient) and the test formulations with different concentrations of the antiphlogistic active ingredients in the in vivo determination of the SPF. Evidence of anti-inflammatory activity of the sunscreen antiphlogistics bisabolol and panthenol was also not apparent in the UV model over a time course of 48 h. Conlusion: The antiphlogistic ingredients panthenol and bisabolol incorporated in the tested sunscreen formula do not interfere with erythema reddening and thus do not affect the SPF value in vivo."

Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing. However, little is known about how H2Aub1 is read to exert downstream physiological functions. The animal ZUOTIN-RELATED FACTOR1 (ZRF1) has been reported to bind H2Aub1 to promote or repress the expression of varied target genes. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ZRF1 homologs, AtZRF1a and AtZRF1b, are key regulators of multiple processes during plant growth and development. Loss of function of both AtZRF1a and AtZRF1b in atzrf1a atzrf1b mutants causes seed germination delay, small plant size, abnormal meristem activity, abnormal flower development, as well as gametophyte transmission and embryogenesis defects. Some of these defects overlap with those described previously in the PRC1-defective mutants atbmi1a atbmi1b and atring1a atring1b, but others are specific to atzrf1a atzrf1b In line with this, 4,519 genes (representing more than 14% of all genes) within the Arabidopsis genome are found differentially expressed in atzrf1a atzrf1b seedlings, and among them, 114 genes are commonly up-regulated in atring1a atring1b and atbmi1a atbmi1b Finally, we show that in both atzrf1a atzrf1b and atbmi1a atbmi1b seedlings, the seed developmental genes ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3, CRUCIFERIN3, and CHOTTO1 are derepressed, in association with the reduced levels of H2Aub1 and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Collectively, our results indicate that AtZRF1a/b play both PRC1-related and PRC1-unrelated functions in regulating plant growth and development and that AtZRF1a/b promote H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 deposition in gene suppression.

We have recently reported that the protein ZRF1 specifically binds to monoubiquitinated histone H2A and derepresses Polycomb target genes at the onset of cellular differentiation. Our results suggest that ZRF1 exerts its function in a two-step mechanism, by initially displacing the Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) from chromatin and subsequently acting together with histone H2A-specific deubiquitinases to facilitate transcriptional activation of its target genes. These findings demonstrate an ambiguity of the epigenetic monoubiquitin mark at histone H2A. Once considered to be a hallmark of gene silencing, it is now clear that this mark can also be utilized as a recruitment platform for proteins engaged in gene activation. Genome-wide analyses demonstrate that ZRF1 is recruited to typical Polycomb target genes, thereby putting it in a position to have an impact on differentiation and animal development. This molecular mechanism for ZRF1 may represent one of the first steps in switching silenced genes to a transcriptionally active state.

The correlation between DNA methylation and a subset of histone post-translational modifications (positive and negative) has hinted at an underlying regulatory crosstalk between histone marks and DNA methylation in patterning the human DNA methylome, an idea further supported by corresponding alterations to both histone marks and DNA methylation during malignant transformation. This study investigated the framework by which histone marks influence DNA methylation at a genome-wide level. Using RNAi in a pluripotent human embryonic carcinoma cell line we depleted essential components of the MLL/COMPASS, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and PRC1 histone modifying complexes that establish, respectively, the post-translational modifications H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H2AK119ub, and assayed the impact of the subsequent depletion of these marks on the DNA methylome. Absence of H2AK119ub resulted predominantly in hypomethylation across the genome. Depletion of H3K4me3 and, surprisingly, H3K27me3 caused CpG island hypermethylation at a subset of loci. Intriguingly, many promoters were co-regulated by all three histone marks, becoming hypermethylated with loss of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 and hypomethylated with depletion of H2AK119ub, and many of these co-regulated loci were among those commonly targeted for aberrant hypermethylation in cancer. Taken together, our results elucidate novel roles for polycomb and MLL/COMPASS in regulating DNA methylation and define targets of this regulation."

BACKGROUND The INK4/ARF locus encodes three tumor suppressor genes (p15(Ink4b), Arf and p16(Ink4a)) and is frequently inactivated in a large number of human cancers. Mechanisms regulating INK4/ARF expression are not fully characterized. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here we show that in young proliferating embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) member EZH2 together with PRC1 members BMI1 and M33 are strongly expressed and localized at the INK4/ARF regulatory domain (RD) identified as a DNA replication origin. When cells enter senescence the binding to RD of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes is lost leading to a decreased level of histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). This loss is accompanied with an increased expression of the histone demethylase Jmjd3 and with the recruitment of the MLL1 protein, and correlates with the expression of the Ink4a/Arf genes. Moreover, we show that the Polycomb protein BMI1 interacts with CDC6, an essential regulator of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Finally, we demonstrate that Polycomb proteins and associated epigenetic marks are crucial for the control of the replication timing of the INK4a/ARF locus during senescence. CONCLUSIONS We identified the replication licencing factor CDC6 as a new partner of the Polycomb group member BMI1. Our results suggest that in young cells Polycomb proteins are recruited to the INK4/ARF locus through CDC6 and the resulting silent locus is replicated during late S-phase. Upon senescence, Jmjd3 is overexpressed and the MLL1 protein is recruited to the locus provoking the dissociation of Polycomb from the INK4/ARF locus, its transcriptional activation and its replication during early S-phase. Together, these results provide a unified model that integrates replication, transcription and epigenetics at the INK4/ARF locus."

The structure of a high-activity variant in complex with E2 (PCGF5-RING1B-UbcH5c) reveals only subtle differences from an earlier PCGF4 complex structure. However, two charged residues present in the modelled interface with E2-conjugated ubiquitin prove critical: in BMI1/PCGF4, these residues form a salt bridge that may limit efficient ubiquitin transfer. The intrinsically low activity of the PCGF4-RING1B heterodimer is offset by a relatively favourable interaction with nucleosome substrates, resulting in an efficient site-specific monoubiquitination."

To gain insight into the structure and function of bivalent domains, we mapped key histone modifications and subunits of Polycomb-repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) genomewide in human and mouse ES cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by ultra high-throughput sequencing. We find that bivalent domains can be segregated into two classes -- the first occupied by both PRC2 and PRC1 (PRC1-positive) and the second specifically bound by PRC2 (PRC2-only). PRC1-positive bivalent domains appear functionally distinct as they more efficiently retain lysine 27 tri-methylation upon differentiation, show stringent conservation of chromatin state, and associate with an overwhelming number of developmental regulator gene promoters. We also used computational genomics to search for sequence determinants of Polycomb binding. This analysis revealed that the genomewide locations of PRC2 and PRC1 can be largely predicted from the locations, sizes, and underlying motif contents of CpG islands.

Centromeres are characterized by the centromere-specific H3 variant CENP-A, which is embedded in chromatin with a pattern characteristic of active transcription that is required for centromere identity. It is unclear how centromeres remain transcriptionally active despite being flanked by repressive pericentric heterochromatin. To further understand centrochromatin's response to repressive signals, we nucleated a Polycomb-like chromatin state within the centromere of a human artificial chromosome (HAC) by tethering the methyltransferase EZH2. This led to deposition of the H3K27me3 mark and PRC1 repressor binding. Surprisingly, this state did not abolish HAC centromere function or transcription, and this apparent resistance was not observed on a noncentromeric locus, where transcription was silenced. Directly tethering the reader/repressor PRC1 bypassed this resistance, inactivating the centromere. We observed analogous responses when tethering the heterochromatin Editor Suv39h1-methyltransferase domain (centromere resistance) or reader HP1\u03b1 (centromere inactivation), respectively. Our results reveal that the HAC centromere can resist repressive pathways driven by H3K9me3/H3K27me3 and may help to explain how centromeres are able to resist inactivation by flanking heterochromatin."

The porphyrias are a group of disorders in which enzymatic deficiencies in heme production lead to toxic accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), which are involved in the neurovisceral attacks. Givosiran acts as a conventional siRNA to trigger RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing on delta-ALA synthase 1 (ALAS1), thus returning ALA and PBG metabolites to the physiological level to attenuate further neurotoxicity. Givosiran makes use of a new hepatic-delivery system that conjugates three GalNac (N-acetylgalactosamine) molecules to the siRNA passenger strand. GalNac binds to the liver asialoglycoprotein receptor, favoring the internalization of these GalNac-conjugated siRNAs into the hepatic cells. In a phase I study, subcutaneous monthly administration of givosiran 2.5 mg/kg reduced > 90% of ALA and PBG content. This siRNA is being analyzed in ENVISION (NCT03338816), a phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial. In preliminary results, givosiran achieved clinical endpoints for AIP, reducing urinary ALA levels, and presented a safety profile that enabled further drug development.

BACKGROUND Up-regulation of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), with resultant accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen, is central to the pathogenesis of acute attacks and chronic symptoms in acute hepatic porphyria. Givosiran, an RNA interference therapy, inhibits ALAS1 expression. METHODS In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned symptomatic patients with acute hepatic porphyria to receive either subcutaneous givosiran (2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo monthly for 6 months. The primary end point was the annualized rate of composite porphyria attacks among patients with acute intermittent porphyria, the most common subtype of acute hepatic porphyria. (Composite porphyria attacks resulted in hospitalization, an urgent health care visit, or intravenous administration of hemin at home.) Key secondary end points were levels of ALA and porphobilinogen and the annualized attack rate among patients with acute hepatic porphyria, along with hemin use and daily worst pain scores in patients with acute intermittent porphyria. RESULTS A total of 94 patients underwent randomization (48 in the givosiran group and 46 in the placebo group). Among the 89 patients with acute intermittent porphyria, the mean annualized attack rate was 3.2 in the givosiran group and 12.5 in the placebo group, representing a 74% lower rate in the givosiran group (P<0.001); the results were similar among the 94 patients with acute hepatic porphyria. Among the patients with acute intermittent porphyria, givosiran led to lower levels of urinary ALA and porphobilinogen, fewer days of hemin use, and better daily scores for pain than placebo. Key adverse events that were observed more frequently in the givosiran group were elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, changes in serum creatinine levels and the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and injection-site reactions. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with acute intermittent porphyria, those who received givosiran had a significantly lower rate of porphyria attacks and better results for multiple other disease manifestations than those who received placebo. The increased efficacy was accompanied by a higher frequency of hepatic and renal adverse events. (Funded by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals; ENVISION ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03338816.)."

OBJECTIVE Since 1983, hemin has been FDA-approved for acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) attacks. In 2019, FDA approved givosiran for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria. The objective of this research was to estimate and compare the total cost of AIP-related healthcare for patients treated with hemin or givosiran. METHODS A microsimulation cost model was developed to estimate the annual economic impact of hemin versus givosiran treatment for patients with AIP from the U.S. healthcare payer perspective. Hemin treatment costs were calculated from the Hemin Shipment Data in which patients were defined as receiving acute attack treatment or prophylaxis treatment based on shipment patterns. Three separate hemin subpopulations were considered: one attack per year, multiple attacks per year, and hemin prophylaxis. Treatment costs for givosiran (with hemin for acute attacks) were simulated based on Phase III trial efficacy results applied to individual treatment histories in the Hemin Shipment Data. Other healthcare utilization was also considered. Outcomes were annualized and expenditures inflated to 2019. RESULTS For all patients with AIP, the average annual total cost of care with hemin was 78% lower (difference = $482,113; 95% CI=$373,638-$594,778) than the average annual total cost of care with givosiran. Average annual total cost of care with hemin was between 46% and 92% lower than givosiran for the three hemin subpopulations: one attack per year (difference = $545,219; 95% CI=$436,584-$657,239), multiple attacks per year (difference = $459,366; 95% CI=$350,291-$574,403), and hemin prophylaxis (difference = $311,950; 95% CI=$191,898-$435,893). Cost savings with hemin were robust to one-way and probabilistic sensitivity as well as scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS Hemin is expected to provide cost savings compared to givosiran for all AIP patients and subpopulations. Lower annual total costs of care with hemin range from $311,950 to $545,219 less depending on whether the patient uses hemin prophylactically or for acute treatment attacks."

This phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile of subcutaneously (SC) administered givosiran in patients with acute intermittent porphyria, the most common AHP type. Givosiran was rapidly absorbed from the SC injection site with peak plasma concentrations achieved within 0.5-5 hours followed by elimination with a short half-life of 4-10 hours. Plasma exposures of AS(N-1)3' givosiran, an active metabolite with equal potency as givosiran, was 35%-75%. Givosiran treatment resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent reduction in urinary aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) towards the upper limit of normal (ULN) in AHP patients. Greater and more sustained reductions in ALA and PBG were achieved with once monthly dosing compared with once quarterly dosing. After monthly dosing, trough ALA levels were reduced to below the ULN, approximately 95% reduction from baseline, at both the 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg doses."

Recent advances in pathophysiological and genetic mechanisms of some neuromuscular diseases and a rapid progress in new pharmacological technologies led to an accelerated development of innovative treatments, generating an unexpected therapeutic revolution. In part 1, we report already commercially available drugs, just approved drugs and new therapeutic promises in the treatment of peripheral neuropathies. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is a devastating disease due to amyloid accumulation in peripheral nerves, heart and autonomic system. The first specific drug approved for hATTR was tafamidis, a TTR tetramer stabilizer. In 2018, the positive results of two phase 3 trials have been reported leading to start of regulatory approval route for inotersen, an antisense oligonucleotide and patisiran, the first-ever RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic. System biology targeting approach has indicated baclofen, naltrexone and sorbitol in combination (PXT3003) as candidate drugs for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. This hypothesis was confirmed in experimental models and in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. Givosiran, another RNAi therapeutic, targeting 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase, has been positively tested in acute intermittent porphyria in phase 1/2 and ongoing phase 3 trials. Although allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation resulted recently a long-term therapy in mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE), a new strategy is liver transplantation which is able to revert the severe biochemical and clinical imbalance of the disease. Recently, a gene therapy has been tested in a MNGIE murine model, indicating that it may become a new therapeutic option."

The porphyrias are a family of metabolic disorders caused by defects in the activity of one of the enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding hydroxymethylbilane synthase, can lead to hepatocyte overaccumulation and systemic distribution of the proximal porphyrin precursors, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). ALA and PBG are toxic to neurons and extrahepatic tissue and cause the neurovisceral clinical manifestations of AIP. Management of AIP includes awareness and avoidance of triggering factors, infusions of hemin for severe acute attacks, and, if indicated for chronic suppressive therapy, maintenance treatment with hemin or givosiran, a small interfering RNA molecule that antagonizes ALA synthase 1 transcripts. Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is most commonly caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the gene encoding ferrochelatase (FECH), the heme pathway terminal enzyme. FECH deficiency leads to erythrocyte overaccumulation and high plasma levels of lipophilic protoporphyrins that photoactivate in the skin, causing burning pain and erythema. Protoporphyrins excreted in the bile can cause gallstones, cholestasis, fibrosis, and ultimately liver failure. Management of EPP includes skin protection and afamelanotide, an \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone analog that increases melanin pigment and reduces photoactivation. Liver transplantation may be necessary for severe EPP-induced liver complications. Because AIP and EPP arise from defects in the heme biosynthetic pathway, hematologists are often consulted to evaluate and manage suspected or proven porphyrias. A working knowledge of these disorders increases our confidence and effectiveness as consultants and medical providers."

BACKGROUND Induction of delta aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 ( ALAS1) gene expression and accumulation of neurotoxic intermediates result in neurovisceral attacks and disease manifestations in patients with acute intermittent porphyria, a rare inherited disease of heme biosynthesis. Givosiran is an investigational RNA interference therapeutic agent that inhibits hepatic ALAS1 synthesis. METHODS We conducted a phase 1 trial of givosiran in patients with acute intermittent porphyria. In part A of the trial, patients without recent porphyria attacks (i.e., no attacks in the 6 months before baseline) were randomly assigned to receive a single subcutaneous injection of one of five ascending doses of givosiran (0.035, 0.10, 0.35, 1.0, or 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. In part B, patients without recent attacks were randomly assigned to receive once-monthly injections of one of two doses of givosiran (0.35 or 1.0 mg per kilogram) or placebo (total of two injections 28 days apart). In part C, patients who had recurrent attacks were randomly assigned to receive injections of one of two doses of givosiran (2.5 or 5.0 mg per kilogram) or placebo once monthly (total of four injections) or once quarterly (total of two injections) during a 12-week period, starting on day 0. Safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and exploratory efficacy outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 23 patients in parts A and B and 17 patients in part C underwent randomization. Common adverse events included nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Serious adverse events occurred in 6 patients who received givosiran in parts A through C combined. In part C, all 6 patients who were assigned to receive once-monthly injections of givosiran had sustained reductions in ALAS1 messenger RNA (mRNA), delta aminolevulinic acid, and porphobilinogen levels to near normal. These reductions were associated with a 79% lower mean annualized attack rate than that observed with placebo (exploratory efficacy end point). CONCLUSIONS Once-monthly injections of givosiran in patients who had recurrent porphyria attacks resulted in mainly low-grade adverse events, reductions in induced ALAS1 mRNA levels, nearly normalized levels of the neurotoxic intermediates delta aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, and a lower attack rate than that observed with placebo.

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme of the heme synthesis pathway. Symptoms of AIP usually manifest as intermittent acute attacks with occasional neuropsychiatric crises. The management of AIP includes treatment of acute attacks, prevention of attacks, long-term monitoring and treatment of chronic complications. Intravenous injection of heme is the most effective method of treating acute attacks. Carbohydrate loading is used when heme is unavailable or in the event of mild attacks. Symptomatic treatment is also needed during attacks. Prevention of attacks includes eliminating precipitating factors, heme prophylaxis and liver transplantation. New treatment options include givosiran (siRNA) to down-regulate ALA synthase-1 (ALAS1) and the messenger RNA of PBGD (PBGD mRNA) delivered to the liver cells of patients with AIP.

Elagolix exposures also appeared to be similar in women with normal hepatic function and women with mild hepatic impairment. Elagolix area under the curve in women with moderate hepatic impairment and with severe hepatic impairment was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than in women with normal hepatic function. The adverse event incidence was low, with the main events being mild nausea and headache. No dosage adjustment was needed in women with renal impairment or women with mild hepatic impairment.

Uterine fibroids are the most common gynecological disorder, classically requiring surgery when symptomatic. Although attempts at finding a nonsurgical cure date back to centuries, it is only around the middle of the last century that serious attempts at a medical treatment were carried out. Initially, both progestins and estrogen-progestin combinations have been utilized, although proof of their usefulness is lacking. A major step forward was achieved when peptide analogs of the GnRH were introduced, first those with superagonist properties and subsequently those acting as antagonists. Initially, the latter produced side effects preventing their routine utilization; eventually, this problem was overcome following the synthesis of cetrorelix. Because both types of analogs produce hypoestrogenism, their use is limited to a maximum of 6 months and, for this reason, today they are utilized as an adjuvant treatment before surgery with overall good results. Over the last decade, new, nonpeptidic, orally active GnRH-receptor blockers have also been synthesized. One of them, Elagolix, is in the early stages of testing in women with fibroids. Another fundamental development has been the utilization of the so-called selective progesterone receptor modulators, sometimes referred to as \"antiprogestins\". The first such compound to be applied to the long-term treatment of fibroids was Mifepristone; today, this compound is mostly used outside of Western Countries, where the substance of choice is Ulipristal acetate. Large clinical trials have proven the effectiveness of Ulipristal in the long-term medical therapy of fibroids, although some caution must be exercised because of the rare occurrence of liver complications. All selective progesterone receptor modulators produce unique endometrial changes that are today considered benign, reversible, and without negative consequences. In conclusion, long-term medical treatment of fibroids seems possible today, especially in premenopausal women."

Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common gynaecological benign disease. Even though often asymptomatic, UFs can worsen women's health and their quality of life, causing heavy bleeding and anaemia, pelvic discomfort and reduced fertility. Surgical treatment of UFs could be limited by its invasiveness and the desire to preserve fertility. Thus, effective medical therapies for the management of this condition are needed. Common drugs used to control bleeding, such us hormonal contraceptive or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, have no effect on fibroids volume. Among other more efficient treatments, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or the selective progesterone-receptor modulators have a non-neutral safety profile; thus, they are used for limited periods or for cyclic treatments. Elagolix is a potent, orally bioavailable, non-peptide GnRH antagonist that acts by a competitive block of the GnRH receptor. The biological effect is a dose-dependent inhibition of gonadal axis, without a total suppression of estradiol concentrations. For this reason, even though comparative studies between elagolix and GnRH agonists have not been performed, elagolix has been associated with a better profile of adverse events. Recently, elagolix received US FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe pain caused by endometriosis. Several clinical trials assessed the efficacy of elagolix for the treatment of heavy bleeding caused by UFs and the definitive results of Phase III studies are expected. Available data on elagolix and UFs showed that the drug, with or without low-dose hormone add-back therapy, is able to significantly reduce menstrual blood loss, lead to amenorrhea and improve haemoglobin concentrations in the majority of participants in comparison with placebo. The safety and tolerability profile appeared generally acceptable. The concomitant use of add-back therapy can prevent bone loss due to the hypoestrogenic effect and can improve safety during elagolix treatment."

CONTEXT Elagolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist recently approved for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain and being developed for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. OBJECTIVE The objective was to evaluate the effects of elagolix on ovulation and ovarian sex hormones. DESIGN AND SETTING This was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. PARTICIPANTS Participants were healthy ovulatory women aged 18 to 40 years. INTERVENTIONS Elagolix was administered orally for 3 continuous 28-day dosing intervals at 100 to 200 mg once daily (QD), 100 to 300 mg twice daily (BID), and 300 mg BID plus estradiol/norethindrone acetate (E2/NETA) 1/0.5 mg QD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcomes measures were ovulation rates measured by transvaginal ultrasound, progesterone concentrations, and hormone suppression. RESULTS Elagolix suppressed ovulation in a dose-dependent manner. The percentage of women who ovulated was highest at 100 mg QD (78%), intermediate at 150 and 200 mg QD and 100 mg BID (47%-57%), and lowest at 200 and 300 mg BID (32% and 27%, respectively). Addition of E2/NETA to elagolix 300 mg BID further suppressed the ovulation rate to 10%. Elagolix also suppressed luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone in a dose-dependent manner, leading to dose-dependent suppression of estradiol and progesterone. Elagolix had no effect on serum biomarker of ovarian reserve, and reduced endometrial thickness compared to the screening cycle. CONCLUSION Women being treated with elagolix may ovulate and should use effective methods of contraception. The rate of ovulation was lowest with elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA 1/0.5 mg QD."

Elagolix coadministered with estradiol/norethindrone acetate is in late-stage development for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Based on the in vitro profile of elagolix metabolism and disposition, 9 drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies evaluating the victim and perpetrator characteristics of elagolix were conducted in 144 healthy volunteers. As a victim of cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and transporter-mediated DDIs, elagolix area under the curve (AUC) increased by \u223c2-fold following coadministration with ketoconazole and by \u223c5- and \u223c2-fold with single and multiple doses of rifampin, respectively. As a perpetrator, elagolix decreased midazolam AUC (90% confidence interval) by 54% (50%-59%) and increased digoxin AUC by 32% (23%-41%). Elagolix decreased rosuvastatin AUC by 40% (29%-50%). No clinically significant changes in exposure on coadministration with sertraline or fluconazole occurred. A elagolix 150-mg once-daily regimen should be limited to 6 months with strong CYP3A inhibitors and rifampin because of the potential increase in bone mineral density loss, as described in the drug label. A 200-mg twice-daily regimen is recommended for no more than 1 month with strong CYP3A inhibitors and not recommended with rifampin. Elagolix is contraindicated with strong organic anion transporter polypeptide B1 inhibitors (eg, cyclosporine and gemfibrozil). Consider increasing the doses of midazolam and rosuvastatin when coadministered with elagolix, and individualize therapy based on patient response. Clinical monitoring is recommended for P-glycoprotein substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (eg, digoxin). Dose adjustments are not required for sertraline, fluconazole, bupropion (or any CYP2B6 substrate), or elagolix when coadministered."

The pharmacokinetics of elagolix have been well-characterized in phase I studies; however, elagolix population pharmacokinetics have not been previously reported. Therefore, a robust model was developed to describe elagolix population pharmacokinetics and to evaluate factors affecting elagolix pharmacokinetic parameters. METHODS The data from nine clinical studies (a total of 1624 women) were included in the analysis: five phase I studies in healthy, premenopausal women and four phase III studies in premenopausal women with endometriosis. RESULTS Elagolix population pharmacokinetics were best described by a two-compartment model with a lag time in absorption. Of the 15 covariates tested for effect on elagolix apparent clearance (CL/F) and/or volume of distribution only one covariate, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 genotype status, had a statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, effect on elagolix CL/F.

BACKGROUND Uterine fibroids are one of the most common neoplasms found among women globally, with a prevalence of approximately 11 million women in the United States alone. The morbidity of this common disease is significant because it is the leading cause of hysterectomy and causes significant functional impairment for women of reproductive age. Factors including age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, menstrual blood loss, fibroid location, and uterine and fibroid volume influence the incidence of fibroids and severity of symptoms. Elagolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist that competitively inhibits pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor activity and suppresses the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland, resulting in dose-dependent suppression of ovarian sex hormones, follicular growth, and ovulation. In Elaris Uterine Fibroids 1 and Uterine Fibroids 2, 2 replicate multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies, treatment of premenopausal women with elagolix with hormonal add-back therapy demonstrated reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. OBJECTIVE This analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elagolix (300 mg twice a day) with add-back therapy (1 mg estradiol/0.5 mg norethindrone acetate once a day) in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in various subgroups of women over 6 months of treatment. STUDY DESIGN Data were pooled from Elaris Uterine Fibroid-1 and Uterine Fibroid-2 studies, which evaluated premenopausal women (18-51 years) with heavy menstrual bleeding (>80 mL menstrual blood loss per cycle, alkaline hematin methodology) and ultrasound-confirmed uterine fibroid diagnosis. Subgroups analyzed included age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, baseline menstrual blood loss, fibroid location, and uterine and primary fibroid volume (largest fibroid identified by ultrasound). The primary endpoint was the proportion of women with <80 mL menstrual blood loss during the final month and \u226550% menstrual blood loss reduction from baseline to final month. Secondary and other efficacy endpoints included mean change in menstrual blood loss from baseline to final month, amenorrhea, symptom severity, and health-related quality of life. Adverse events and other safety endpoints were monitored. RESULTS The overall pooled Elaris Uterine Fibroid-1 and Uterine Fibroid-2 population was typical of women with fibroids, with a mean age of 42.4 (standard deviation, 5.4) years and a mean body mass index of 33.6 (standard deviation, 7.3) kg/m2 and 67.6% of participants being black or African American women. A wide range of baseline uterine and fibroid volumes and menstrual blood loss were also represented in the overall pooled study population. In all subgroups, the proportion of responders to the primary endpoint, mean change in menstrual blood loss, amenorrhea, reduction in symptom severity, and improvement in health-related quality of life were clinically meaningfully greater for women who received elagolix with add-back therapy than those who received placebo and consistent with the overall pooled study population for the primary endpoint (72.2% vs 9.3%), mean change in menstrual blood loss (-172.5 mL vs -0.8 mL), amenorrhea (50.4% vs 4.5%), symptom severity (-37.1 vs -9.2), and health-related quality of life score (39.9 vs 8.9). Adverse events by subgroup were consistent with the overall pooled study population.

METHODS We conducted two identical, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month phase 3 trials (Elaris Uterine Fibroids 1 and 2 [UF-1 and UF-2]) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elagolix at a dose of 300 mg twice daily with hormonal \"add-back\" therapy (to replace reduced levels of endogenous hormones; in this case, estradiol, 1 mg, and norethindrone acetate, 0.5 mg, once daily) in women with fibroid-associated bleeding. An elagolix-alone group was included to assess the impact of add-back therapy on the hypoestrogenic effects of elagolix. The primary end point was menstrual blood loss of less than 80 ml during the final month of treatment and at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline to the final month; missing data were imputed with the use of multiple imputation. RESULTS A total of 412 women in UF-1 and 378 women in UF-2 underwent randomization, received elagolix or placebo, and were included in the analyses. Criteria for the primary end point were met in 68.5% of 206 women in UF-1 and in 76.5% of 189 women in UF-2 who received elagolix plus add-back therapy, as compared with 8.7% of 102 women and 10% of 94 women, respectively, who received placebo (P<0.001 for both trials). Among the women who received elagolix alone, the primary end point was met in 84.1% of 104 women in UF-1 and in 77% of 95 women in UF-2. Hot flushes (in both trials) and metrorrhagia (in UF-1) occurred significantly more commonly with elagolix plus add-back therapy than with placebo. Hypoestrogenic effects of elagolix, especially decreases in bone mineral density, were attenuated with add-back therapy. CONCLUSIONS Elagolix with add-back therapy was effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids.

Genes in nematode and ascidian genomes frequently occur in operons--multiple genes sharing a common promoter to generate a polycistronic primary transcript--and such genes comprise 15-20% of the coding genome for Caenorhabditis elegans and Ciona intestinalis. Recent work in nematodes has demonstrated that the identity of genes within operons is highly conserved among species and that the unifying feature of genes within operons is that they are expressed in germline tissue. However, it is generally unknown what processes are responsible for generating the distribution of operon sizes across the genome, which are composed of up to eight genes per operon. Here we investigate several models for operon evolution to better understand their abundance, distribution of sizes, and evolutionary dynamics over time. We find that birth-death models of operon evolution reasonably describe the relative abundance of operons of different sizes in the C. elegans and Ciona genomes and generate predictions about the number of monocistronic, nonoperon genes that likely participate in the birth-death process. This theory, and applications to C. elegans and Ciona, motivates several new and testable hypotheses about eukaryote operon evolution."

By using a combination of RT-PCR and ChIP analysis we found that pol II generally transcribes up to 1 kb past the poly(A) sites into the 3' flanking regions of the nematode genes before it terminates. We also show that pol II does not terminate after transcription of internal poly(A) sites in operons.

BACKGROUND The zinc finger (ZF) protein CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is highly conserved in Drosophila and vertebrates where it has been shown to mediate chromatin insulation at a genomewide level. A mode of genetic regulation that involves insulators and insulator binding proteins to establish independent transcriptional units is currently not known in nematodes including Caenorhabditis elegans. We therefore searched in nematodes for orthologs of proteins that are involved in chromatin insulation. RESULTS While orthologs for other insulator proteins were absent in all 35 analysed nematode species, we find orthologs of CTCF in a subset of nematodes. As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more derived nematodes. Here, all or some of these components are missing. Instead operons, polycistronic transcriptional units common in derived nematodes, seemingly adopted their function."

Operons are regulated multigene transcription units, in which polycistronic pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA coding for multiple peptides) is processed to monocistronic mRNAs. This occurs by 3' end formation and trans-splicing using the specialized SL2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle for downstream mRNAs. Previously, the correlation between downstream location in an operon and SL2 trans-splicing has been strong, but anecdotal. Although only 28 operons have been reported, the complete sequence of the C. elegans genome reveals numerous gene clusters. To determine how many of these clusters represent operons, we probed full-genome microarrays for SL2-containing mRNAs. We found significant enrichment for about 1,200 genes, including most of a group of several hundred genes represented by complementary DNAs that contain SL2 sequence. Analysis of their genomic arrangements indicates that >90% are downstream genes, falling in 790 distinct operons. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes.

The genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is unusual among eukaryotes, in that it contains operons. Approximately 15% of genes in the worm are clustered into groups of between two and eight genes, which are under the control of shared regulatory sequences. Polycistronic transcripts from such operons are trans-spliced, during transcription, to produce mature monocistronic messengers. The C. elegans frataxin gene, frh-1, is encoded in the operon CEOP2232. This is one of the largest operons identified thus far in the C. elegans genome. Here we describe in detail the structure of all of the coding units within this operon. The operon is composed of eight genes of a diverse nature, organized in a complex structure. We have produced transgenic strains carrying fusions between gfp and a number of genes from the operon. These constructs show complex differential expression patterns that suggest the presence of internal promoters and regulatory sequences in the operon. This organization would permit both coordinated expression and differential expression of the components of the CEOP2232 operon. The heterogeneity of the genes, and their complex expression patterns, suggests that the clustering of CEOP2232 is not due to a need for synchronized expression of genes involved in the same physiological pathway."

Operons are widespread in prokaryotes, but are uncommon in eukaryotes, except nematode worms, where approximately 15% of genes reside in over 1100 operons in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. It is unclear how operons have become abundant in nematode genomes. The \"one-way street\" hypothesis asserts that once formed by chance, operons are very difficult to break, because the breakage would leave downstream genes in an operon without a promoter, and hence, unexpressed. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the presence and absence of C. elegans operons in Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis remanei, and Caenorhabditis brenneri, using Pristionchus pacificus and Brugia malayi as outgroups, and identified numerous operon gains and losses. Coupled with experimental examination of trans-splicing patterns, our comparative genomic analysis revealed diverse molecular mechanisms of operon losses, including inversion, insertion, and relocation, but the presence of internal promoters was not found to facilitate operon losses. In several cases, the data allowed inference of mechanisms by which downstream genes are expressed after operon breakage. We found that the rate of operon gain is approximately 3.3 times that of operon loss. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics of nematode operons is better described as \"easy come, slow go,\" rather than a \"one-way street.\" Based on a mathematic model of operon gains and losses and additional assumptions, we projected that the number of operons in C. elegans will continue to rise by 6%-18% in future evolution before reaching equilibrium between operon gains and losses."

One of the most pressing challenges in the post genomic era is the identification and characterization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), as these are essential in understanding the cellular physiology of health and disease. Experimental techniques suitable for characterizing PPIs (X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, among others) are usually laborious, time-consuming and often difficult to apply to membrane proteins, and therefore require accurate prediction of the candidate interacting partners. High-throughput experimental methods (yeast two-hybrid and affinity purification) succumb to the same shortcomings, and can also lead to high rates of false positive and negative results. Therefore, reliable tools for predicting PPIs are needed. The use of the operon structure in the eukaryote Caenorhabditis elegans genome is a valuable, though underserved, tool for identifying physically or functionally interacting proteins. Based on the concept that genes organized in the same operon may encode physically or functionally related proteins, this algorithm is easy to be applied and, importantly, gives a limited number of candidate partners of a given protein, allowing for focused experimental verification.

We have surveyed the genomes of Trichinella spiralis, Trichuris muris, and Romanomermis culicivorax and identified the first putative operons in members of the Enoplea. Consistent with the mechanism of polycistronic RNA resolution in other nematodes, the mRNAs produced by genes downstream of the first gene in the T. spiralis and T. muris operons are trans-spliced to spliced leader RNAs, and we are able to detect polycistronic RNAs derived from these operons. Importantly, a putative intercistronic region from one of these potential enoplean operons confers polycistronic processing activity when expressed as part of a chimeric operon in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that T. spiralis genes located in operons have an increased likelihood of having operonic C. elegans homologs. However, operon structure in terms of synteny and gene content is not tightly conserved between the two taxa, consistent with models of operon evolution. We have nevertheless identified putative operons conserved between Enoplea and Chromadorea.

Until recently, in the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the contribution of B cells has been largely underestimated, and the disease was considered a T-cell-mediated disorder. However, newer evidence shows that B cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MS via antigen-driven autoantibody responses and through the cross regulation of T-helper cells. As B cells express the surface molecule CD20 at all points of differentiation, it provides a specific target for monoclonal antibodies, and the development and clinical testing of anti-CD20 antibody treatments for MS have been successful. After some observations, some small clinical trials found positive effects for the first anti-CD20 therapeutic rituximab in MS; newer agents have been specifically evaluated, resulting in the development of ocrelizumab and ofatumumab. Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was approved in March 2017 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is also the first proven therapy to reduce disability progression in primary progressive MS. This is particularly significant considering that disease-modifying treatment options are few for both primary and secondary progressive MS. Ofatumumab, a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, that binds a distinct epitope, has been further investigated in phase 3 trials for relapsing forms of MS.

The remarkable success of anti-CD20 B cell depletion therapies in reducing the burden of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease has prompted significant interest in how B cells contribute to neuroinflammation. Most focus has been on identifying pathogenic CD20+ B cells. However, an increasing number of studies have also identified regulatory functions of B lineage cells, particularly the production of IL-10, as being associated with disease remission in anti-CD20-treated MS patients. Moreover, IL-10-producing B cells have been linked to the attenuation of inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS. In addition to IL-10-producing B cells, antibody-producing plasma cells (PCs) have also been implicated in suppressing neuroinflammation. This review will examine regulatory roles for B cells and PCs in MS and EAE. In addition, we speculate on the involvement of regulatory PCs and the cytokine BAFF in the context of anti-CD20 treatment. Lastly, we explore how the microbiota could influence anti-inflammatory B cell behavior.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW To critically assess the current landscape of disease-modifying agents for multiple sclerosis (MS). Treatment algorithms will be discussed and studies for new agents in late development or recently approved are analyzed in terms of their impact on current treatment strategies. RECENT FINDINGS A real-world study from Wales suggests that early initiation of highly effective therapy may provide more benefit that an escalation approach in relapsing MS. A study from the MSBase dataset found evidence that early treatment with highly effective therapies decreased the risk of developing secondary progressive MS. Ocrelizumab is highly efficacious in relapsing MS and in a group of patients with primary progressive MS. Another CD20 directed mAb, ofatumumab, is in phase 3. A large study examining extended interval dosing of natalizumab in an attempt to decrease the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is underway. Cladribine and alemtuzumab may work by immune reconstitution. Siponimod was recently approved by United States Federal Drug Administration for relapsing MS and active secondary progressive MS. Other S1P receptor modulators are being studied in phase 3 trials for relapsing MS. Cladribine received FDA approval as treatment for relapsing and active secondary progressive MS. Autologous hematopoetic stem-cell transplantation may be an option for treatment-refractory MS. SUMMARY Development of disease-modifying agents in MS continues to be successful.

OBJECTIVE To assess dose-response effects of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ofatumumab on efficacy and safety outcomes in a phase 2b double-blind study of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). METHODS Patients (n = 232) were randomized to ofatumumab 3, 30, or 60 mg every 12 weeks, ofatumumab 60 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo for a 24-week treatment period, with a primary endpoint of cumulative number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions (per brain MRI) at week 12. Relapses and safety/tolerability were assessed, and CD19+ peripheral blood B-lymphocyte counts measured. Safety monitoring continued weeks 24 to 48 with subsequent individualized follow-up evaluating B-cell repletion. RESULTS The cumulative number of new lesions was reduced by 65% for all ofatumumab dose groups vs placebo (p < 0.001). Post hoc analysis (excluding weeks 1-4) estimated a \u226590% lesion reduction vs placebo (week 12) for all cumulative ofatumumab doses \u226530 mg/12 wk. Dose-dependent CD19 B-cell depletion was observed. Notably, complete depletion was not necessary for a robust treatment effect. The most common adverse event was injection-related reactions (52% ofatumumab, 15% placebo), mild to moderate severity in 97%, most commonly associated with the first dose and diminishing on subsequent dosing. CONCLUSION Imaging showed that all subcutaneous ofatumumab doses demonstrated efficacy (most robust: cumulative doses \u226530 mg/12 wk), with a safety profile consistent with existing ofatumumab data. This treatment effect also occurred with dosage regimens that only partially depleted circulating B cells.

The emerging B-cell depleting therapies, particularly anti-CD20 agents such as rituximab, ocrelizumab, as well as the fully human ofatumumab, have shown promising clinical and magnetic resonance imaging benefit. One potential effect of these therapies is the depletion of memory B-cells, the primary reservoir site where EBV latency occurs. In addition, EBV potentially interacts with both genetic and other environmental factors to increase susceptibility and disease severity of MS. This review examines the role of EBV in MS pathophysiology and summarizes the recent clinical and radiological findings, with a focus on B-cells and in vivo imaging. Addressing the potential link between EBV and MS allows the better understanding of MS pathogenesis and helps to identify additional disease biomarkers that may be responsive to B-cell depleting intervention."

The latest development of B-cell depletion by anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies has been a large step forward in the treatment of this devastating disease. AREAS COVERED In this manuscript, we review mechanisms of action, efficacy, safety, and tolerance of anti-CD20 therapies for MS, including rituximab, ocrelizumab, and ofatumumab. EXPERT OPINION B-cell depletion efficiently suppresses acute inflammatory disease activity in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and may slowdown progression in primary progressive MS (PPMS). The treatment is generally well tolerated, with manageable adverse events related to infusion reactions and infections. Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, is the first therapy to be approved for the treatment of both RRMS and PPMS."

OBJECTIVES We present the first study to explore safety and efficacy of the human CD20 monoclonal antibody ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients received 2 ofatumumab infusions (100 mg, 300 mg, or 700 mg) or placebo 2 weeks apart. At week 24, patients received alternate treatment. Safety and efficacy were assessed. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients were randomized (ofatumumab/placebo, n = 26; placebo/ofatumumab, n = 12) and analyzed; 36 completed the study. Two patients in the 300-mg group withdrew from the study because of adverse events. No unexpected safety signals emerged. Infusion-related reactions were common on the first infusion day but not observed on the second infusion day. None of the patients developed human anti-human antibodies. Ofatumumab was associated with profound selective reduction of B cells as measured by CD19(+) expression. New brain MRI lesion activity was suppressed (>99%) in the first 24 weeks after ofatumumab administration (all doses), with statistically significant reductions (p < 0.001) favoring ofatumumab found in new T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions, total enhancing T1 lesions, and new and/or enlarging T2 lesions. CONCLUSIONS Ofatumumab (up to 700 mg) given 2 weeks apart was not associated with any unexpected safety concerns and was well tolerated in patients with RRMS. MRI data suggest a clinically meaningful effect of ofatumumab for all doses studied. Results warrant further exploration of ofatumumab in RRMS. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class II evidence that in patients with RRMS, ofatumumab compared with placebo does not increase the number of serious adverse events and decreases the number of new MRI lesions."

Teriflunomide, an oral inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis, reduces T-cell and B-cell activation. The relative effects of these two drugs in patients with multiple sclerosis are not known. METHODS In two double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 trials, we randomly assigned patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis to receive subcutaneous ofatumumab (20 mg every 4 weeks after 20-mg loading doses at days 1, 7, and 14) or oral teriflunomide (14 mg daily) for up to 30 months. The primary end point was the annualized relapse rate. Secondary end points included disability worsening confirmed at 3 months or 6 months, disability improvement confirmed at 6 months, the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions per T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, the annualized rate of new or enlarging lesions on T2-weighted MRI, serum neurofilament light chain levels at month 3, and change in brain volume. RESULTS Overall, 946 patients were assigned to receive ofatumumab and 936 to receive teriflunomide; the median follow-up was 1.6 years. The annualized relapse rates in the ofatumumab and teriflunomide groups were 0.11 and 0.22, respectively, in trial 1 (difference, -0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.16 to -0.06; P<0.001) and 0.10 and 0.25 in trial 2 (difference, -0.15; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.09; P<0.001). In the pooled trials, the percentage of patients with disability worsening confirmed at 3 months was 10.9% with ofatumumab and 15.0% with teriflunomide (hazard ratio, 0.66; P = 0.002); the percentage with disability worsening confirmed at 6 months was 8.1% and 12.0%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.68; P = 0.01); and the percentage with disability improvement confirmed at 6 months was 11.0% and 8.1% (hazard ratio, 1.35; P = 0.09). The number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions per T1-weighted MRI scan, the annualized rate of lesions on T2-weighted MRI, and serum neurofilament light chain levels, but not the change in brain volume, were in the same direction as the primary end point. Injection-related reactions occurred in 20.2% in the ofatumumab group and in 15.0% in the teriflunomide group (placebo injections). Serious infections occurred in 2.5% and 1.8% of the patients in the respective groups. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with multiple sclerosis, ofatumumab was associated with lower annualized relapse rates than teriflunomide.

OBJECTIVE Evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral rimegepant when used for acute treatment concomitantly with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand or receptor (CGRP mAb) for the preventive treatment of migraine. BACKGROUND The efficacy of CGRP mAbs for the preventive treatment of migraine and the small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist rimegepant for acute treatment has been demonstrated in randomized controlled clinical trials. Over the past few years, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved 4 CGRP mAbs for the preventive treatment of migraine and 2 small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists for the acute treatment of migraine. A previous case report of 2 patients receiving concomitant treatment with rimegepant and erenumab suggested that rimegepant may be safely used as acute treatment in patients who are also receiving a preventive regimen involving CGRP mAbs. We report here 13 additional patients with migraine who simultaneously used rimegepant and either erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab and assess the rate of on-treatment adverse events (AEs). METHODS This was a substudy nested within a multicenter, open-label, long-term safety study in adults with 2-14 monthly migraine attacks of moderate to severe pain intensity. A subgroup experiencing 2-8 monthly attacks and taking a stable dose of a CGRP mAb also took rimegepant 75 mg as needed up to once daily for acute treatment for 12 weeks. RESULTS The 13 patients (11 women [85%]; mean age 49.9 years) enrolled in the substudy were being treated with CGRP mAbs (erenumab [n = 7], fremanezumab [n = 4], or galcanezumab [n = 2]). Mean (SD) time in the rimegepant treatment period was 9.6 (4.6) weeks. Mean (SD) 4-week rimegepant exposure was 7.8 (5.5) doses; a total of 224 doses were taken. Five (38%) patients reported \u22651 on-treatment AE. Of these, 2 (15%) patients had mild or moderate nasopharyngitis; no other AEs occurred in \u22652 patients. Three patients had AEs of mild or moderate severity that were considered potentially treatment-related. No patients had serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, or aminotransferase levels >3\u00d7 the upper limit of normal. CONCLUSION Rimegepant, when used as an oral acute treatment in patients receiving CGRP mAbs as preventive treatment, was well tolerated; no safety issues were identified. Studies involving larger patient populations are needed to confirm these findings."

BACKGROUND Migraine is a debilitating headache disorder which affects approximately 12% of the general population and is the cause of significant loss of productivity (i.e., lost time from work or school) for those afflicted. The current standard of care, the 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists known as triptans, is contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease due to their inherent vasoconstrictive activity; thus, there is a need to develop an alternative therapy for the treatment of the disorder. OBJECTIVE This article reviews patent publications related to the use of small molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists for the treatment of migraine that have appeared in the literature within the past decade. The commentary is supplemented by information presented in journal articles and focuses on the activity of several major pharmaceutical companies in the field. CONCLUSION Two small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, olcegepant and telcagepant, have been shown to be clinically efficacious in the treatment of migraine, and thus provide validation of this novel therapeutic mechanism."

OBJECTIVE To provide the first clinical report that 2 calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) therapies, a small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist and an anti-CGRP receptor antibody, can be used concomitantly to treat refractory migraine. METHODS Case reports are presented of 2 patients participating in a long-term safety study of rimegepant 75 mg oral tablets for acute treatment (NCT03266588). After Food and Drug Administration approval of erenumab, both patients started subcutaneous erenumab monthly as allowed per protocol. RESULTS Patients were women 44 and 36 years of age with \u22652 decades of self-reported suboptimal response to multiple migraine medications. Patient 1 used rimegepant for 6 months and then started erenumab 70 mg subcutaneous monthly. Despite a response to preventive treatment with erenumab, she experienced substantial relief treating 7 of 7 acute attacks with rimegepant and eliminated regular, frequent use of ibuprofen and a caffeinated analgesic. Patient 2 used rimegepant for 60 days before starting erenumab 140 mg subcutaneously monthly. While on erenumab, 9 of 9 attacks treated with rimegepant responded. She stopped near-daily use of injectable ketorolac and diphenhydramine. While using rimegepant alone or together with erenumab, patients reported no related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Rimegepant 75 mg may be effective for acute treatment during concomitant erenumab preventive administration. The mechanism underlying the benefits of concomitant use of a small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist and an anti-CGRP receptor antibody is unknown and requires further study.

It is characterized by episodic, often disabling headache, photophobia and phonophobia, autonomic symptoms (nausea and vomiting), and in a subgroup an aura in the beginning of the attack. Although still debated, many researchers consider migraine to be a disorder in which CNS dysfunction plays a pivotal role while various parts of the trigeminal system are necessary for the expression of associated symptoms.Treatment of migraine has in recent years seen the development of drugs that target the trigeminal sensory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or its receptor. Several of these drugs are now approved for use in frequent episodic and in chronic migraine. CGRP-related therapies offer considerable improvements over existing drugs, as they are the first to be designed specifically to act on the trigeminal pain system: they are more specific and have little or no adverse effects. Small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, gepants, are effective for acute relief of migraine headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (Eptinezumab, Fremanezumab, and Galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (Erenumab) effectively prevent migraine attacks. The neurobiology of CGRP signaling is briefly summarized together with key clinical evidence for the role of CGRP in migraine headache, including the efficacy of CGRP-targeted treatments."

BACKGROUND The treatment of migraine is impeded by several difficulties, among which insufficient headache relief, side effects, and risk for developing medication overuse headache (MOH). Thus, new acutely acting antimigraine drugs are currently being developed, among which the small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, gepants, and the 5-HT1F receptor agonist lasmiditan. Whether treatment with these drugs carries the same risk for developing MOH is currently unknown. MAIN BODY Pathophysiological studies on MOH in animal models have suggested that decreased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) levels, increased calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) expression and changes in 5-HT receptor expression (lower 5-HT1B/D and higher 5-HT2A expression) may be involved in MOH. The decreased 5-HT may increase cortical spreading depression frequency and induce central sensitization in the cerebral cortex and caudal nucleus of the trigeminal tract. Additionally, low concentrations of 5-HT, a feature often observed in MOH patients, could increase CGRP expression. This provides a possible link between the pathways of 5-HT and CGRP, targets of lasmiditan and gepants, respectively. Since lasmiditan is a 5-HT1F receptor agonist and gepants are CGRP receptor antagonists, they could have different risks for developing MOH because of the different (over) compensation mechanisms following prolonged agonist versus antagonist treatment. CONCLUSION The acute treatment of migraine will certainly improve with the advent of two novel classes of drugs, i.e., the 5-HT1F receptor agonists (lasmiditan) and the small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists (gepants). Data on the effects of 5-HT1F receptor agonism in relation to MOH, as well as the effects of chronic CGRP receptor blockade, are awaited with interest."

Migraine is a highly disabling neurovascular disorder characterized by a severe headache (associated with nausea, photophobia and/or phonophobia), and trigeminovascular system activation involving the release of calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP). Novel anti-migraine drugs target CGRP signaling through either stimulation of 5-HT1F receptors on trigeminovascular nerves (resulting in inhibition of CGRP release) or direct blockade of CGRP or its receptor. Lasmiditan is a highly selective 5-HT1F receptor agonist and, unlike the triptans, is devoid of vasoconstrictive properties, allowing its use in patients with cardiovascular risk. Since lasmiditan can actively penetrate the blood-brain barrier, central therapeutic as well as side effects mediated by 5-HT1F receptor activation should be further investigated. Other novel anti-migraine drugs target CGRP signaling directly. This neuropeptide can be targeted by the monoclonal antibodies eptinezumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab, or by CGRP-neutralizing L-aptamers called Spiegelmers. The CGRP receptor can be targeted by the monoclonal antibody erenumab, or by small-molecule antagonists called gepants. Currently, rimegepant and ubrogepant have been developed for acute migraine treatment, while atogepant is studied for migraine prophylaxis. Of these drugs targeting CGRP signaling directly, eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab, rimegepant and ubrogepant have been approved for clinical use, while atogepant is in the last stage before approval. Although all of these drugs seem highly promising for migraine treatment, their safety should be investigated in the long-term. Moreover, the exact mechanism(s) of action of these drugs need to be elucidated further, to increase both safety and efficacy and to increase the number of responders to the different treatments, so that all migraine patients can satisfactorily be treated."

                    "text": "Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Modulators - The History and Renaissance of a New Migraine Drug Class. Several lines of evidence pointed to an important role for CGRP in migraine. These included the anatomic colocalization of CGRP and its receptor in sensory fibers innervating pain-producing meningeal blood vessels, its release by trigeminal stimulation, the observation of elevated CGRP in the cranial circulation during migraine with normalization concomitant with headache relief by sumatriptan, and translational studies with intravenous (IV) CGRP that evoked migraine only in migraineurs. The development of small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists (CGRP-RAs) that showed clinical antimigraine efficacy acutely and prophylactically in randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials subsequently gave definitive pharmacological proof of the importance of CGRP in migraine. More recently, CGRP target engagement imaging studies using a CGRP receptor PET ligand [11 C]MK-4232 demonstrated that there was no brain CGRP receptor occupancy at clinically effective antimigraine doses of telcagepant, a prototypic CGRP-RA. Taken together, these data indicated that (1) the therapeutic site of action of the CGRP-RAs was peripheral not central; (2) that IV CGRP had most likely evoked migraine through an action at sites outside the blood-brain barrier; and (3) that migraine pain was therefore, at least in part, peripheral in origin. The evolution of CGRP migraine science gave impetus to the development of peripherally acting drugs that could modulate CGRP chronically to prevent frequent episodic and chronic migraine. Large molecule biologic antibody (mAb) approaches that are given subcutaneously to neutralize circulating CGRP peptide (fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or block CGRP receptors (erenumab) have shown consistent efficacy and tolerability in multicenter migraine prevention trials and are now approved for clinical use. Eptinezumab, a CGRP neutralizing antibody given IV, shows promise in late stage clinical development. Recently, orally administered next-generation small molecule CGRP-RAs have been shown to have safety and efficacy in acute treatment (ubrogepant and rimegepant) and prevention (atogepant) of migraine, giving additional CGRP-based therapeutic options for migraine patients."

PATIENTS A 14-year-old boy with refractory B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia given chimeric antigen receptor cells developed severe cytokine release syndrome 7 days after the drug product infusion with progressive respiratory failure. He was admitted to PICU with a clinical picture of acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation, and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. INTERVENTIONS Hemoadsorption with cartridge column (Cytosorb) in combination with continuous renal replacement therapy was associated to the anti-cytokine therapy (tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-6 receptor). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Decrease of the inflammatory biomarkers (ferritin, interleukin-6, interleukin-10) in the first 96 hours associated with a progressive improvement of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Pao2/Fio2 ratio) 7 day after the start of the multimodal treatment. CONCLUSIONS This case suggests that hemoadsorption with cartridge column in combination with continuous renal replacement therapy and tocilizumab is safe and potentially effective in pediatric patients with severe cytokine release syndrome."

Acute cytokine release syndromes are associated with some therapeutic antibodies in man, leading to a spectrum of clinical signs from nausea, chills and fever to more serious dose limiting hypotension and tachycardia. When anticipated this syndrome is typically manageable, however this adverse reaction recently became headline news when a massive and unexpected cytokine release syndrome occurred within a few hours of dosing six healthy volunteers with a therapeutic antibody, putting their lives at risk due to multiple organ failure. Preclinical studies did not predict this adverse event, emphasising the need to compare the relative potency of the product in man and the chosen toxicology species, so that additional margins of safety can be applied when conducting first in man (FIM) studies if there is uncertainty over the predictability of the toxicology species. In vitro human PBMC and whole blood cultures may be useful for predicting cytokine release. However since cytokine release arises through at least two distinct mechanisms, it should be emphasised that the utility of these in vitro methods needs to be established for each antibody product."

COVID-19 infection has a heterogenous disease course; it may be asymptomatic or causes only mild symptoms in the majority of the cases, while immunologic complications such as macrophage activation syndrome also known as secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, resulting in cytokine storm syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome, may also occur in some patients. According to current literature, impairment of SARS-CoV-2 clearance due to genetic and viral features, lower levels of interferons, increased neutrophil extracellular traps, and increased pyroptosis and probable other unknown mechanisms create a background for severe disease course complicated by macrophage activation syndrome and cytokine storm. Various genetic mutations may also constitute a risk factor for severe disease course and occurrence of cytokine storm in COVID-19. Once, immunologic complications like cytokine storm occur, anti-viral treatment alone is not enough and should be combined with appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment. Anti-rheumatic drugs, which are tried for managing immunologic complications of COVID-19 infection, will also be discussed including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, JAK inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and colchicine. Early recognition and appropriate treatment of immunologic complications will decrease the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 infection, which requires the collaboration of infectious disease, lung, and intensive care unit specialists with other experts such as immunologists, rheumatologists, and hematologists."

There are still numerous doubts concerning its pathogenesis and particularly the underlying causes of the various clinical courses, ranging from severe manifestations to asymptomatic forms, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. The major factor responsible for acute respiratory distress syndrome is the so-called \"cytokine storm,\" which is an aberrant response from the host immune system that induces an exaggerated release of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines.

In 2019-2020 a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent of a several acute respiratory infection named COVID-19, which is causing a worldwide pandemic. There are still many unresolved questions regarding the pathogenesis of this disease and especially the reasons underlying the extremely different clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe manifestations, including the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 showed phylogenetic similarities to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, and some of the clinical features are shared between COVID-19 and previously identified beta-coronavirus infections. Available evidence indicate that the so called \"cytokine storm\" an uncontrolled over-production of soluble markers of inflammation which, in turn, sustain an aberrant systemic inflammatory response, is a major responsible for the occurrence of ARDS. Chemokines are low molecular weight proteins with powerful chemoattractant activity which play a role in the immune cell recruitment during inflammation. This review will be aimed at providing an overview of the current knowledge on the involvement of the chemokine/chemokine-receptor system in the cytokine storm related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

When cytokines are released into the circulation, systemic symptoms such as fever, nausea, chills, hypotension, tachycardia, asthenia, headache, rash, scratchy throat, and dyspnea can result. In most patients, the symptoms are mild to moderate in severity and are managed easily. However, some patients may experience severe, life-threatening reactions that result from massive release of cytokines. Severe reactions occur more commonly during the first infusion in patients with hematologic malignancies who have not received prior chemotherapy; severe reactions are marked by their rapid onset and the acuity of associated symptoms.

INTRODUCTION Uterine fibroids (UF) are benign tumors common in premenopausal women, with strong impact on the health-care systems. For many years, surgery represented the only therapy for symptomatic fibroids. However, clinicians are observing a switch from surgery to noninvasive methods; in particular, medical treatment has been shown to be efficacious in obtaining a bleeding reduction and in ameliorating patient conditions. AREAS COVERED The authors review the current options available for the treatment of women with UF, with a special focus on the newest one, relugolix. It is an orally active non-peptide Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-receptor antagonist recently licensed for women with symptomatic fibroids. Relugolix is a well-tolerated safe drug; it is effective in inducing a dose-dependent decrease in menstrual blood loss, with faster reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and a greater shrinkage in fibroid volume compared to the current standard of GnRH agonist treatment. EXPERT OPINION Relugolix is a promising drug for the non-surgical treatment of women with UF. To date, the only published data come from a well-selected Japanese female population study while results from worldwide ongoing studies are ongoing in order to confirm the efficacy of this GnRH agonist receptor."

OBJECTIVE To investigate the noninferiority of relugolix compared with leuprorelin acetate in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine leiomyomas. METHODS In a double-blind, double-dummy trial, premenopausal women with uterine leiomyomas and heavy menstrual bleeding defined as a pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of at least 120 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to relugolix (40 mg, oral, once daily) or leuprorelin acetate (1.88 mg or 3.75 mg, monthly injection) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a total pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10 for weeks 6-12. Secondary endpoints included myoma and uterine volumes, and hemoglobin levels. A sample size of 144 patients per group (n=288) was estimated to provide at least 90% power to demonstrate noninferiority (prespecified noninferiority margin -15%; one-sided 0.025 level of significance). RESULTS From March 2016 to September 2017, 281 patients were randomized (relugolix, n=139, leuprorelin n=142). Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced; mean pictorial blood loss assessment chart score was 254.3 in the relugolix group and 263.7 in the leuprorelin group. The proportion of patients with total pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10 for weeks 6-12 was 82.2% in the relugolix group and 83.1% in the leuprorelin group, demonstrating noninferiority of relugolix compared with leuprorelin (relugolix-leuprorelin difference -0.9%; 95% CI: -10.10 to 8.35; prespecified noninferiority margin -15%; P=.001). Reductions in myoma and uterine volumes and increases in hemoglobin levels were comparable in the two groups. Relugolix was associated with an earlier effect on menstrual bleeding than leuprorelin (pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10, 64.2% vs 31.7% [relugolix-leuprorelin difference 32.5%; 95% CI: 20.95-44.13%] for weeks 2-6 and pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of 0, 52.6% vs 21.8% [30.7%; 95% CI: 19.45-42.00%] for weeks 2-6) and faster recovery of menses after treatment discontinuation (relugolix median [Q1, Q3], 37 days [32.0, 46.0]; leuprorelin median, 65 days [54.0, 77.0]). Adverse events and bone mineral density loss were similar between relugolix and leuprorelin treatment groups. CONCLUSION In women with uterine leiomyomas, once-daily treatment with relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, demonstrated noninferiority to monthly leuprorelin for improvement of heavy menstrual bleeding at 6-12 weeks of treatment, had a more rapid effect on menstrual bleeding, and was generally well tolerated.

BACKGROUND Injectable luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (e.g., leuprolide) are the standard agents for achieving androgen deprivation for prostate cancer despite the initial testosterone surge and delay in therapeutic effect. The efficacy and safety of relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, as compared with those of leuprolide are not known. METHODS In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with advanced prostate cancer, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive relugolix (120 mg orally once daily) or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary end point was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng per deciliter) through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound castrate levels (<20 ng per deciliter) on day 15. Testosterone recovery was evaluated in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS A total of 622 patients received relugolix and 308 received leuprolide. Of men who received relugolix, 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.9 to 97.9) maintained castration through 48 weeks, as compared with 88.8% (95% CI, 84.6 to 91.8) of men receiving leuprolide. The difference of 7.9 percentage points (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.8) showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix (P<0.001 for superiority). All other key secondary end points showed superiority of relugolix over leuprolide (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with castrate levels of testosterone on day 4 was 56.0% with relugolix and 0% with leuprolide. In the subgroup of 184 patients followed for testosterone recovery, the mean testosterone levels 90 days after treatment discontinuation were 288.4 ng per deciliter in the relugolix group and 58.6 ng per deciliter in the leuprolide group. Among all the patients, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was 2.9% in the relugolix group and 6.2% in the leuprolide group (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS In this trial involving men with advanced prostate cancer, relugolix achieved rapid, sustained suppression of testosterone levels that was superior to that with leuprolide, with a 54% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.

BACKGROUND External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with neoadjuvant/adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an established treatment option to prolong survival for patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, was evaluated in this clinical setting in comparison with degarelix, an injectable GnRH antagonist. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix to achieve and maintain castration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A phase 2 open-label study was conducted in 103 intermediate-risk PCa patients undergoing primary EBRT and neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT between June 2014 and December 2015. INTERVENTION Patients randomly assigned (3:2) to 24-wk treatment with either daily oral relugolix or 4-wk subcutaneous depot degarelix (reference control). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration (testosterone <1.73nmol/l) in relugolix patients between 4 and 24 wk of treatment. Secondary endpoints included rate of profound castration (testosterone <0.7nmol/l), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate volume, quality of life (QoL) assessed using the Aging Males' Symptoms scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life (30-item EORTC core questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] and 25-item EORTC prostate cancer module [EORTC QLQ-PR25]) questionnaires, and safety. No formal statistical comparisons with degarelix were planned. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Castration rates during treatment were 95% and 82% with relugolix and 89% and 68% with degarelix for 1.73 and 0.7nmol/l thresholds, respectively. Median time to castration in the relugolix arm was 4 d. During treatment, PSA levels and prostate volumes were reduced in both groups. Three months after discontinuing treatment, 52% of men on relugolix and 16% on degarelix experienced testosterone recovery (statistical significance of differences not tested). Mean and median QoL scores improved following treatment discontinuation. The most common adverse event was hot flush (relugolix 57%; degarelix 61%). Lack of blinding was a potential limitation. CONCLUSIONS Relugolix achieved testosterone suppression to castrate levels within days and maintained it over 24 wk with a safety profile consistent with its mechanism of action.

PATIENT(S) Premenopausal Japanese women (N = 65) experiencing moderate-to-severe uterine fibroid-associated pain with a maximum Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score of \u22654 were randomized and completed the study. INTERVENTION(S) Once-daily 40 mg relugolix (n = 33) or placebo (n = 32) for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Primary end point: proportion of patients with a maximum NRS score of \u22641 during the 28-day period before the final dose of study drug. Secondary end points: proportion of patients with no pain (NRS = 0) and percentage of days without pain during the 28-day period before the final dose of study drug; adverse events. RESULT(S) More patients receiving relugolix versus placebo achieved a maximum NRS score of \u22641 during the 28-day period before the final dose of study drug (57.6% vs. 3.1%). Similarly, more patients receiving relugolix versus placebo achieved a maximum NRS score of 0 (48.5% vs. 3.1%) and experienced more days without pain (96.4% vs. 71.4%). More patients receiving relugolix versus placebo experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; 87.9% vs. 56.3%); however, the rate of treatment discontinuation was low and not different between groups. Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in intensity. TEAEs (\u226510%) included hot flush, metrorrhagia, hyperhidrosis, and menorrhagia, consistent with relugolix's mechanism of action, and viral upper respiratory tract infection. CONCLUSION(S) Relugolix improved uterine fibroid-associated pain and was well tolerated. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS NCT02655224. JAPIC CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION JapicCTI-163127."

Although their amino acid sequences and structure closely resemble DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt2 proteins were recently shown by Goll and colleagues to function as RNA methyltransferases transferring a methyl group to the C5 position of C38 in tRNA(Asp). We observe that human DNMT2 methylates tRNA isolated from Dnmt2 knock-out Drosophila melanogaster and Dictyostelium discoideum. RNA extracted from wild type D. melanogaster was methylated to a lower degree, but in the case of Dictyostelium, there was no difference in the methylation of RNA isolated from wild-type and Dnmt2 knock-out strains. Methylation of in vitro transcribed tRNA(Asp) confirms it to be a target of DNMT2. Using site directed mutagenesis, we show here that the enzyme has a DNA methyltransferase-like mechanism, because similar residues from motifs IV, VI, and VIII are involved in catalysis as identified in DNA methyltransferases. In addition, exchange of C292, which is located in a CFT motif conserved among Dnmt2 proteins, strongly reduced the catalytic activity of DNMT2. Dnmt2 represents the first example of an RNA methyltransferase using a DNA methyltransferase type of mechanism."

The cytosine analogues azacytidine and decitabine are currently being developed as drugs for epigenetic cancer therapy. Although various studies have shown that both drugs are effective in inhibiting DNA methylation, it has also become clear that their mode of action is not limited to DNA demethylation. Because azacytidine is a ribonucleoside, the primary target of this drug may be cellular RNA rather than DNA. We have now analyzed the possibility that azacytidine inhibits the RNA methyltransferase DNMT2. We found that DNMT2 is variably expressed in human cancer cell lines. RNA bisulfite sequencing showed that azacytidine, but not decitabine, inhibits cytosine 38 methylation of tRNA(Asp), a major substrate of DNMT2. Azacytidine caused a substantially stronger effect than decitabine on the metabolic rate of all the cancer cell lines tested, consistent with an effect of this drug on RNA metabolism. Of note, drug-induced loss of RNA methylation seemed specific for DNMT2 target sites because we did not observe any significant demethylation at sites known to be methylated by other RNA methyltransferases. Our results uncover a novel and quantifiable drug activity of azacytidine and raise the possibility that tRNA hypomethylation might contribute to patient responses."

We show that RNA signals through human TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8, but incorporation of modified nucleosides m5C, m6A, m5U, s2U, or pseudouridine ablates activity.

OBJECTIVES Coeliac disease (CD) is a complex autoimmune disorder that develops in genetically susceptible individuals. Dietary gluten triggers an immune response for which the only available treatment so far is a strict, lifelong gluten free diet. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes and several non-HLA regions have been associated with the genetic susceptibility to CD, but their role in the pathogenesis of the disease is still essentially unknown, making it complicated to develop much needed non-dietary treatments. Here, we describe the functional involvement of a CD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the 5'UTR of XPO1 in the inflammatory environment characteristic of the coeliac intestinal epithelium. DESIGN The function of the CD-associated SNP was investigated using an intestinal cell line heterozygous for the SNP, N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-related knock-out and HLA-DQ2 mice, and human samples from patients with CD. RESULTS Individuals harbouring the risk allele had higher m6A methylation in the 5'UTR of XPO1 RNA, rendering greater XPO1 protein amounts that led to downstream nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) activity and subsequent inflammation. Furthermore, gluten exposure increased overall m6A methylation in humans as well as in in vitro and in vivo models. CONCLUSION We identify a novel m6A-XPO1-NFkB pathway that is activated in CD patients. The findings will prompt the development of new therapeutic approaches directed at m6A proteins and XPO1, a target under evaluation for the treatment of intestinal disorders."

Occurring once in every 2000 live births, craniosynostosis is one of the most frequent congenital anomalies encountered by the craniofacial surgeon. Syndromic craniosynostoses account for approximately 15 percent of cases and demonstrate Mendelian patterns of inheritance with well-established genetic causes; however, nonsyndromic craniosynostoses, which account for approximately 85 percent of cases, are genetically heterogeneous and largely unexplored. Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is sporadic in more than 95 percent of affected families; thus, surgeons have suggested for decades that nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is likely a fluke occurrence. Contrary to this, recent studies have established that genetics underlie a substantial fraction of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis risk. Given the predominantly sporadic occurrence of disease, parents are often bewildered by the primary occurrence of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis or even recurrence in their own families and request genetic testing. Existing genetic testing panels are useful when the phenotype strongly resembles a known syndrome, wherein the risk of disease recurrence can be accurately predicted for future offspring of the parents and the future offspring of the affected child. The diagnostic utility of existing panels for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, however, is extremely low, and these tests are quite costly. Recent genetic studies have identified several novel genes and pathways that cause nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, providing genetic evidence linking the causes of syndromic and nonsyndromic craniosynostoses, and allowing for genotype-based prediction of risk of recurrence in some nonsyndromic families. Based on analysis of exome sequence data from 384 families, the authors provide recommendations for a new genetic testing protocol for children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, which include testing nonsyndromic cases of sagittal, metopic, and coronal craniosynostosis."

BACKGROUND Since its first description by Virchow, the principle of abnormal skull growth due to restriction of skull growth at the fused sutures, and the realisation by Moss that the sutures at the skull base are equally affected, have been the main intellectual driving forces behind the majority of cranial expansion procedures performed currently in children with craniosynostosis. CURRENT OBSERVATIONS Despite original impressions that craniosynostosis leads to craniostenosis, many studies have demonstrated that in the majority of patients with craniosynostosis there is normal skull volume in those over the age of 6 months. In Apert syndrome, skull volume is invariably larger than normal. Some studies have shown that intracranial pressure is independent of intracranial volume, and can exist in the presence of normal volume, or indeed after cranial expansion. These observations imply that cranial expansion procedures create a state of artificially increased skull volume, in the quest to improve appearance and function. FUTURE ADVANCES This creates a new angle of view through which skull growth abnormalities are seen. It is becoming clearer that in most patients with craniosynostosis, there is regional imbalance of skull growth, which co-exists with a variety of other equally important factors, such as genetic defects, raised intracranial pressure, venous hypertension, and other brain parenchymal anomalies such as hindbrain hernia or hydrocephalus. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the type of surgical treatment currently practised in most cases is conceptually incorrect. Recent modifications such as the use of springs or distraction do not escape from the underlying philosophy of cranial expansion. With that in mind, it is hoped that advances in the fields of genetics and molecular biology will provide treatments for the cause of craniosynostosis rather than the symptomatic relief that surgery offers currently. CONCLUSION Until then, there is a need to develop better ways of quantifying regional abnormalities of skull growth."

Bioinformatics analysis was used to evaluate the potential deleterious or benign effect of each genetic variant through evolutionary conservation alignment, multi-lines of computer predication and the allele frequency in population dataset (control and patient). The Standards and guidelines from American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics was used to classify and interpret the pathogenicity for each genetic variant.

Variable expressivity is a well-known phenomenon in this disorder. A large Indian family has been recently identified as carrying a nonsense TWIST mutation (Q28 X) in 17 members, of whom 16 were examined in detail. Only 4 (25%) of the patients showed patent craniostenosis, namely, oxycephaly. The penetrance of craniosynostosis in this family is lower than previously reported in the literature. Fifteen patients (93%) had moderate to severe ptosis. Minor limb and external ear abnormalities were present in most patients. Eyelid features were the hallmark of the disease for 12 members of the family, suggesting that mutations in TWIST may lead to a phenotype with mainly palpebral features and no craniostenosis. The clinical analysis of this large family clearly illustrates the significant variable expressivity, probably related to haploinsufficiency because of the TWIST mutation.

The craniosynostoses represent a group of pathologies characterised by the premature fusion (during prenatal or perinatal stages or early infancy) of one or more of the cranial sutures. Its genetic origins are not completely clear although mutations in the genes that code for fibroblast growth factor receptors have been described; depending upon the gene involved, the type of mutation and the embryological period in which the mutation itself occurs, a type of craniosynostosis arises that may involve one or more cranial sutures.

Here, a case report is presented of a Caucasian male child affected by craniostenosis of the sagittal suture with a orthodontic-orthopedic diagnosed ogival palate and insufficient space for the eruption of the superior canines.

The results obtained were equivalent to those obtained in subjects with no past medical history of craniosynostosis. This clinical study demonstrated that the premature fusion of the mid-sagittal suture of the skull, that characterises sagittal craniosynostoses, can occur without the involvement of the median suture of the palate, rendering expansion possible by means of orthopedic treatment."

BACKGROUND Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and aggressive syndrome of excessive cytokine requiring prompt recognition and aggressive therapy. AIMS We aimed to systematically characterize HLH in moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS We performed a systematic review of the literature (PubMED; EMBASE) and FDA Adverse Event Reporting System in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Use of biologics was used as a surrogate definition for disease severity (consistent with usual and contemporary clinical management), to enable identification of rare HLH cases with the highest fidelity. RESULTS 58 cases of HLH occurring in IBD patients are known (mean age: 26.0 years, 70% male, 83% with Crohn's disease, mean disease duration 7.0 years). 34.5% of patients were undergoing induction therapy at HLH diagnosis. All cases occurred on patients exposed to anti-TNF agents, but cases with anti-integrin or anti-IL-12/23 exposure were reported. 2/3 of cases did not report prior AZA/6MP exposure. Underlying opportunistic infection or lymphoma was found in > 80% of cases. Survival was 70% if promptly recognized and treated. Five patients restarted biologics after HLH resolved, and one patient developed recurrent HLH. CONCLUSIONS HLH is rare among IBD patients exposed to biologic therapy. Most cases had an identifiable infection or malignancy at the time of diagnosis as well as history of immunomodulator use. Risk factors may include younger age, male gender, presence of Crohn's disease, and induction phase of treatment. Our study is not intended to assess risk of HLH with specific IBD therapies."

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a multisystem inflammation, generated by the uncontrolled and excessive activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Severe immunodeficiency and generalized macrophage activation can often be detected in the background of this life threatening disorder. It is classified as a primary immunodeficiency. Functional abnormalities of the perforin protein or defects in granule secretory mechanisms are caused by gene mutations in most cases. Diagnostic criteria of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are the following: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias affecting at least two of the 3 lineages in peripheral blood, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperferritinemia, elevated serum level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25), hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis in bone marrow and decreased cytotoxic T cell and natural killer cell activity. In this case report the authors summarize the utility of functional flow cytometry in the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Using flow cytometry, elevated intracellular perforin content, decreased killing activity of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells, and impaired cell surface expression of CD107a (LAMP1 protein) from in vitro stimulated blood lymphocytes were detected. Abnormal secretion of perforin was also demonstrated. Genetic testing revealed mutation of the MUNC 13-4 gene, which confirmed the base of the abnormal flow cytometric findings. This case report demonstrates the value of functional flow cytometry in the rapid diagnosis of genetically determined hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a condition in which early diagnosis is critical for optimal management.

Mesenteric panniculitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by non-specific inflammation of the adipose tissue in the mesentery. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a life-threating disease associated with aberrant macrophage overactivation, in which infections can be a leading cause in immunocompromised hosts. Here, we report a rare case of mesenteric panniculitis and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis complicated by disseminated Mycobacterium intracellulare. A 71-year-old male with mesenteric panniculitis was admitted to our hospital for fever and pancytopenia. He was treated with oral prednisolone (15 mg/day) and cyclosporin A (150 mg/day) at presentation. Physical and laboratory examinations revealed disseminated infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria; Mycobacterium intracellulare was detected in cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, sputum, and gastric fluid. Patient signs and symptoms fulfilled the five criteria for a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, including fever, cytopenia, hemophagocytosis, hyperferritinemia, and high soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels. Therefore, the diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacteria-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was established. An anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy including chloramphenicol (800 mg/day), rifampin (450 mg/day) and ethambutol (750 mg/day) together with streptomycin (750 mg twice per week) was initiated at 30 days after admission; maintenance doses of prednisolone were increased to 60 mg/day. Fever and pancytopenia improved in response to anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy. The present case suggests that mesenteric panniculitis could be complicated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis caused by immunosuppressive therapy-associated infections as well as underlying disease activity. In conclusion, the possibility of disseminated nontuberculous mycobacteria infection with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis should be considered if unexplained fever or hematological dyscrasia were presented in patients of mesenteric panniculitis."

Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) or hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an acute and rapidly progressive systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by cytopenia, excessive cytokine production, and hyperferritinemia. Common clinical manifestations of HLH are acute unremitting fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and multiorgan failure. Due to a massive cytokine release, this clinical condition is considered as a cytokine storm syndrome. HPS has primary and acquired (secondary, reactive) forms. Its primary form is mostly seen in childhood and caused by various mutations with genetic inheritance and, therefore, is called familial HLH. Secondary HLH may be caused in the presence of an underlying disorder, that is, secondary to a malignant, infectious, or autoimmune/autoinflammatory stimulus. This paper aims to review the pathogenesis and the clinical picture of HLH, and its severe complication, the cytokine storm, with a special emphasis on the developed classification criteria sets for rheumatologists, since COVID-19 infection has clinical symptoms resembling those of the common rheumatologic conditions and possibly triggers HLH. MED-LINE/Pubmed was searched from inception to April 2020, and the following terms were used for data searching: \"hemophagocytic syndrome\" OR \"macrophage activation syndrome\" OR \"hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\", OR \"cytokine storm\". Finally, AND \"COVID-19\" was included in this algorithm. The selection is restricted to the past 5 years and limited numbers of earlier key references were manually selected. Only full-text manuscripts, published in an English language peer-reviewed journal were included. Manuscript selection procedure and numbers are given in Fig. 2. Briefly, the database search with the following terms of \"Hemophagocytic syndrome\" OR \"Macrophage activation syndrome\" OR \"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\" OR \"Cytokine storm\" yielded 6744 results from inception to April 2020. The selection is restricted to the past 5 years and only limited numbers of earlier key references were selected, and this algorithm resulted in 3080 manuscripts. The addition of (AND \"COVID-19\") resulted in 115 publications of which 47 studies, together with four sections of an online book were used in the final review. No statistical method was used. HLH is triggered by genetic conditions, infections, malignancies, autoimmune-autoinflammatory diseases, and some drugs. In COVID-19 patients, secondary HLH and cytokine storm may be responsible for unexplained progressive fever, cytopenia, ARDS, neurological and renal impairment. Differentiation between the primary and secondary forms of HLH is utterly important, since primary form of HLH requires complicated treatments such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Further studies addressing the performance of HScore and other recommendations in the classification of these patients is necessary."

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, terminology that designates a syndrome that may be familial or sporadic, with or without an associated viral infection, is presented as the prototype of a hemophagocytic syndrome, a condition in which there is uncontrolled activation of the cellular immune system. Diagnostic criteria include idiopathic fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and the presence of hemophagocytosis. The surgical and autopsy pathology features infiltrates composed of lymphocytes and ordinary, but activated, histiocytes and hemophagocytosis. The chronic hepatitis-like hepatic lesion is noted to be characteristic, if not unique, in this age group and setting. Current concepts of pathophysiology focus on the role of cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, soluble IL-2 receptor, plasminogen activator, and prostaglandins. The clinicopathologic features of the syndrome can be accounted for by the uncontrolled and unopposed production and release of these mediators. Nosology places hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in the position of the most important of the \"benign\" histiocytosis syndromes that involve ordinary histiocytes of the mononuclear phagocytic system in contrast to Langerhans cell histiocytosis (histiocytosis X) in which pathological dendritic histiocytes are operative. Features that distinguish hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis from other disorders, such as malignant histiocytosis, X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder, congenital immunodeficiency states, the accelerated phase of Chediak-Higashi syndrome, and cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis, which may be associated with a hemophagocytic syndrome, are presented."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by damage of motor neurons. Recent reports indicate that inflammatory responses occurring within the central nervous system contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS. We aimed to investigate disease-specific gene expression associated with neuroinflammation by conducting transcriptome analysis on fibroblasts from three patients with sporadic ALS and three normal controls. Several pathways were found to be upregulated in patients with ALS, among which the toll-like receptor (TLR) and NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways are related to the immune response. Genes-toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP), mitogen-activated protein kinase 9 (MAPK9), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1)-related to these two pathways were validated using western blotting. This study validated the genes that are associated with TLR and NLR signaling pathways from different types of patient-derived cells. Not only fibroblasts but also induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and neural rosettes from the same origins showed similar expression patterns. Furthermore, expression of TOLLIP, a regulator of TLR signaling pathway, decreased with cellular aging as judged by changes in its expression through multiple passages. TOLLIP expression was downregulated in ALS cells under conditions of inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide. Our data suggest that the TLR and NLR signaling pathways are involved in pathological innate immunity and neuroinflammation associated with ALS and that TOLLIP, MAPK9, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and CXCL1 play a role in ALS-specific immune responses. Moreover, changes of TOLLIP expression might be associated with progression of ALS."

There is compelling evidence that glial-immune interactions contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The adaptive immune response has been implicated in disease processes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but it remains unknown if innate immune signaling also contributes to ALS progression. Here we report that deficiency of the innate immune adaptor TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF), which is essential for certain Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling cascades, significantly shortens survival time and accelerates disease progression of ALS mice. While myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is also a crucial adaptor for most TLR signaling pathways, MyD88 deficiency had only a marginal impact on disease course. Moreover, TRIF deficiency reduced the number of natural killer (NK), NK-T-lymphocytes, and CD8-T cells infiltrating into the spinal cord of ALS mice, but experimental modulation of these populations did not substantially influence survival time. Instead, we found that aberrantly activated astrocytes expressing Mac2, p62, and apoptotic markers were accumulated in the lesions of TRIF-deficient ALS mice, and that the number of aberrantly activated astrocytes was negatively correlated with survival time. These findings suggest that TRIF pathway plays an important role in protecting a microenvironment surrounding motor neurons by eliminating aberrantly activated astrocytes."

BACKGROUND The peripheral immune system is implicated in modulating microglial activation, neurodegeneration and disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Specifically, there is reduced thymic function and regulatory T cell (Treg) number in ALS patients and mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mice, while passive transfer of Tregs ameliorates disease in mutant SOD1 mice. Here, we assessed the effects of augmenting endogenous CD4+ T cell number by stimulating the thymus using surgical castration on the phenotype of transgenic SOD1(G93A) mice. METHOD Male SOD1(G93A) mice were castrated or sham operated, and weight loss, disease onset and progression were examined. Thymus atrophy and blood CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+ FoxP3+ T cell numbers were determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Motor neuron counts, glial cell activation and androgen receptor (AR) expression in the spinal cord were investigated using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Differences between castrated and sham mice were analysed using an unpaired t test or one-way ANOVA. RESULTS Castration significantly increased thymus weight and total CD4+ T cell numbers in SOD1(G93A) mice, although Tregs levels were not affected. Despite this, disease onset and progression were similar in castrated and sham SOD1(G93A) mice. Castration did not affect motor neuron loss or astrocytic activation in spinal cords of SOD1(G93A) mice; however, microglial activation was reduced, specifically M1 microglia. We also show that AR is principally expressed in spinal motor neurons and progressively downregulated in spinal cords of SOD1(G93A) mice from disease onset which is further enhanced by castration. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that increasing thymic function and CD4+ T cell number by castration confers no clinical benefit in mutant SOD1 mice, which may reflect an inability to stimulate neuroprotective Tregs. Nonetheless, castration decreases M1 microglial activation in the spinal cord without any clinical improvement and motor neuron rescue, in contrast to other approaches to suppress microglia in mutant SOD1 mice. Lastly, diminished AR expression in spinal motor neurons, which links to another motor neuron disorder, spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), may contribute to ALS pathogenesis and suggests a common disease pathway in ALS and SBMA mediated by disruption of AR signalling in motor neurons."

Motor Neuron Disease (MND) is a fatal neurodegenerative condition, which is characterized by the selective loss of the upper and lower motor neurons. At the sites of motor neuron injury, accumulation of activated microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, is commonly observed in both human post mortem studies and animal models of MND. Microglial activation has been found to correlate with many clinical features and importantly, the speed of disease progression in humans. Both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory microglial responses have been shown to influence disease progression in humans and models of MND. As such, microglia could both contribute to and protect against inflammatory mechanisms of pathogenesis in MND. While murine models have characterized the microglial response to MND, these studies have painted a complex and often contradictory picture, indicating a need for further characterization in humans. This review examines the potential role microglia play in MND in human and animal studies.

Accumulating evidence from mice expressing ALS-causing mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) has implicated pathological immune responses in motor neuron degeneration. This includes microglial activation, lymphocyte infiltration, and the induction of C1q, the initiating component of the classic complement system that is the protein-based arm of the innate immune response, in motor neurons of multiple ALS mouse models expressing dismutase active or inactive SOD1 mutants. Robust induction early in disease course is now identified for multiple complement components (including C1q, C4, and C3) in spinal cords of SOD1 mutant-expressing mice, consistent with initial intraneuronal C1q induction, followed by global activation of the complement pathway. We now test if this activation is a mechanistic contributor to disease. Deletion of the C1q gene in mice expressing an ALS-causing mutant in SOD1 to eliminate C1q induction, and complement cascade activation that follows from it, is demonstrated to produce changes in microglial morphology accompanied by enhanced loss, not retention, of synaptic densities during disease. C1q-dependent synaptic loss is shown to be especially prominent for cholinergic C-bouton nerve terminal input onto motor neurons in affected C1q-deleted SOD1 mutant mice. Nevertheless, overall onset and progression of disease are unaffected in C1q- and C3-deleted ALS mice, thus establishing that C1q induction and classic or alternative complement pathway activation do not contribute significantly to SOD1 mutant-mediated ALS pathogenesis in mice."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Neuroinflammation is an important mediator of the pathogenesis of disease in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Genetic mutations such as C9orf72 have begun to define the numerous cell autonomous pathways that initiate motor neuron injury. Yet, it is the signalling to surrounding glia and peripherally derived immune cells that initiates the noncell autonomous inflammatory process and promotes self-propagating motor neuron cell death. The purpose of this review is to explore the systemic immune/inflammatory contributions to the pathogenesis of ALS: what are the peripheral pro-inflammatory signatures, what initiates their presence and do they represent potential therapeutic targets. RECENT FINDINGS In ALS, motor neuron cell death is initiated by multiple cell autonomous pathways leading to misfolded proteins, oxidative stress, altered mitochondria, impaired autophagy and altered RNA metabolism, which collectively promote noncell autonomous inflammatory reactivity. The resulting disease is characterized by activated microglia and astrocytes as well as peripherally derived pro-inflammatory innate and adaptive immune cells. In this unrelenting disorder, circulating blood monocytes and natural killer cells are pro-inflammatory. Furthermore, regulatory T lymphocytes are dysfunctional, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins are elevated. SUMMARY The collective dysregulation of cells and cytokines in patients with ALS accurately reflect increased disease burdens, more rapid progression rates and reduced survival times, reinforcing the concept of ALS as a disorder with extensive systemic pro-inflammatory responses. These increased systemic pro-inflammatory immune constituents provide potentially meaningful therapeutic targets."

The immune system has been found to be involved with positive and negative effects in the nervous system of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. In general, T cells, B cells, NK cells, mast cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, microglia, antibodies, complement and cytokines participate in limiting damage. Several mechanisms of action, such as production of neurotrophic growth factors and interaction with neurons and glial cells, have been shown to preserve these latter from injury and stimulate growth and repair. The immune system also participates in proliferation of neural progenitor stem cells and their migration to sites of injury and this activity has been documented in various neurologic disorders including traumatic injury, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, multiple sclerosis, infection, and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and ALS). Many therapies have been shown to stimulate the protective and regenerative aspects of the immune system in humans, such as intravenous immunoglobulins, and other experimental interventions such as vaccination, minocycline, antibodies and neural stem cells, have shown promise in animal models of ALS. Consequently, several immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies have been tried in ALS, generally with no success, in particular intravenous immunoglobulins. The multiple aspects of the immune response in ALS are beginning to be appreciated, and their potential as pharmacologic targets in neurologic disease is being explored."

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the combined blood expression of neuromuscular and inflammatory biomarkers as predictors of disease progression and prognosis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS Logistic regression adjusted for markers of the systemic inflammatory state and principal component analysis were carried out on plasma levels of creatine kinase (CK), ferritin, and 11 cytokines measured in 95 patients with ALS and 88 healthy controls. Levels of circulating biomarkers were used to study survival by Cox regression analysis and correlated with disease progression and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels available from a previous study. Cytokines expression was also tested in blood samples longitudinally collected for up to 4 years from 59 patients with ALS. RESULTS Significantly higher levels of CK, ferritin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12p70, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 and lower levels of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 were found in plasma samples from patients with ALS compared to controls. IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 were the most highly regulated markers when all explanatory variables were jointly analyzed. High ferritin and IL-2 levels were predictors of poor survival. IL-5 levels were positively correlated with CK, as was TNF-\u03b1 with NfL. IL-6 was strongly associated with CRP levels and was the only marker showing increasing expression towards end-stage disease in the longitudinal analysis. CONCLUSIONS Neuromuscular pathology in ALS involves the systemic regulation of inflammatory markers mostly active on T-cell immune responses. Disease stratification based on the prognostic value of circulating inflammatory markers could improve clinical trials design in ALS."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease wherein motor neuron degeneration leads to muscle weakness, progressive paralysis, and death within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Currently, the cause of ALS is unknown but, as with several neurodegenerative diseases, the potential role of neuroinflammation has become an increasingly popular hypothesis in ALS research. Indeed, upregulation of neuroinflammatory factors have been observed in both ALS patients and animal models. One such factor is the inflammatory inducer NF-\u03baB. Besides its connection to inflammation, NF-\u03baB activity can be linked to several genes associated to familial forms of ALS, and many of the environmental risk factors of the disease stimulate NF-\u03baB activation. Collectively, this has led many to hypothesize that NF-\u03baB proteins may play a role in ALS pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the genetic and environmental connections between NF-\u03baB and ALS, as well as how this pathway may affect different CNS cell types, and finally how this may lead to motor neuron degeneration."

The immune system is inextricably linked with many neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neuromuscular disorder affecting motor cell function with an average survival of 3 years from symptoms onset. In ALS, there is a dynamic interplay between the resident innate immune cells, that is, microglia and astrocytes, which may become progressively harmful to motor neurons. Although innate and adaptive immune responses are associated with progressive neurodegeneration, in the early stages of ALS immune activation pathways are primarily considered to be beneficial promoting neuronal repair of the damaged tissues, though a harmful effect of T cells at this stage of disease has also been observed. In addition, although auto-antibodies against neuronal antigens are present in ALS, it is unclear whether these arise as a primary or secondary event to neuronal damage, and whether the auto-antibodies are indeed pathogenic. Understanding how the immune system contributes to the fate of motor cells in ALS may shed light on the triggers of disease as well as on the mechanisms contributing to the propagation of the pathology. Immune markers may also act as biomarkers while pathways involved in immune action may be targets of new therapeutic strategies. Here, we review the modalities by which the immune system senses the core pathological process in motor neuron disorders, focusing on tissue-specific immune responses in the neuromuscular junction and in the neuroaxis observed in affected individuals and in animal models of ALS. We elaborate on existing data on the immunological fingerprint of ALS that could be used to identify clues on the disease origin and patterns of progression."

Serious complications (catastrophes) resulting from diverse neurological diagnostic procedures can be caused by erroneous indication and omission, as well as by delay and erroneous execution or interpretation. Headache, caused by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypotension, is a frequent complication of lumbar puncture; hematic patch is a therapeutic option for severe cases. The most serious complication is cerebral herniation and, for its prevention, computed tomography (CT) or cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must always be performed before lumbar puncture: a lesion with evident mass effect is a contraindication. Some cases of minor subarachnoid hemorrhages can produce sentinel headache: when the findings of CT scans are normal, lumbar puncture must be performed for diagnosis and prevention of a catastrophic recurrence. Edrophonium testing can be complicated with bradycardia and/or asystole. The lack of indication of this procedure is a cause of under-diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, especially in older people. Electromyography produces few complications (rare cases of paraspinal hematomas and pneumothorax). Ultrasound, CT angiography and MR angiography examinations have decreased the indications for cerebral angiography, whose main complications -in addition to contrast reactions, hemorrhage and infection at the injection site- are neurological deficits caused by vascular dissection or atheromatous embolus. Video-electroencephalogram (EEG) recording with medication suppression can be used in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy, which can precipitate repeated seizures with the risk of injuries and status epilepticus. The possible complications of studies performed with invasive electrodes are infections and intracranial hemorrhages. Cerebral biopsy is indicated when treatable disease is suspected but the therapeutic options (radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have potential serious adverse effects. Furthermore, cerebral biopsy can aggravate previous neurological deficits or produce new deficits. Genetic testing is not indicated in healthy children when an untreatable disease is suspected. In adults, genetic testing is appropriate in selected cases, but detailed previous information should be gathered and the possibility of triggering serious emotional reactions should always be considered."

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IHH or pseudotumor cerebri) is an uncommon but important cause of headache, characterized by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of infection and intracranial pathology on neuroimaging. Lumbar puncture (LP) is usually contra-indicated in situations where the ICP is suspected to be high. However, tonsillar herniation is hardly ever reported after an LP in patients suspected of having IHH. The author postulates that increasing brain stiffness reported in IHH may be the reason for this observation. On the other hand, tonsillar herniation may occur as a late complication following lumbo-peritoneal shunt insertion (occasionally used in the management of patients with IHH). This may be due to the decrease in brain stiffness, i.e. an increase in brain compliance as the condition improves following shunt insertion. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging techniques are likely to help us further in understanding the pathogenesis of this curious condition."

Basic studies of CSF that should be performed in all patients with meningitis include measurement of pressure, cell count and white cell differential; determination of glucose and protein levels; Gram's stain; and culture. In bacterial meningitis, Limulus lysate assay and tests to identify bacterial antigens may allow rapid diagnosis. Where there is strong suspicion of tuberculous or fungal meningitis, CSF should also be submitted for acid-fast stain, India ink preparation, and cryptococcal antigen; unless contraindicated by increased intracranial pressure, large volumes (up to 40-50 mL) should be obtained for culture. If a history of residence in the Southwest is elicited, complement-fixing antibodies to Coccidioides immitis should also be ordered. Newer tests based on immunologic methods or gene amplification techniques hold great promise for diagnosis of infections caused by organisms that are difficult to culture or present in small numbers. Despite the great value of lumbar puncture in the diagnosis of meningitis, injudicious use of the procedure may result in death from brain herniation. Lumbar puncture should be avoided if focal neurologic findings suggest concomitant mass lesion, as in brain abscess, and lumbar puncture should be approached with great caution if meningitis is accompanied by evidence of significant intracranial hypertension.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The numbers of patients having cranial CT and lumbar puncture and whether any complications had arisen following lumbar puncture. The appropriateness of the CT request according to local criteria. RESULTS A total of 111 patients were admitted in the initial time period and 47 patients in the second time period. In the first group, 67 patients underwent CT (61%), compared with 36 patients (80%) in the second group. There were eight abnormal scans (12%) in the initial group including three patients with radiological features of cerebral oedema. Of these patients, one underwent lumbar puncture and had no neurological sequelae. In the second group, there were five abnormal scans (14%) with one presenting a contraindication for lumbar puncture due to mild ventricular dilatation. A lumbar puncture was performed in this patient without complication. All patients with abnormal scans had clinical features to suggest raised intracranial pressure. CT scan requests were considered inappropriate in 26% of patients in the initial study period and 56% of patients in the second study period. CONCLUSION More patients with meningitis are undergoing CT and the number of inappropriate requests are increasing.

BACKGROUND Low-dose cranial computed tomography (LD-CCT) based on iterative reconstruction has been shown to have sufficient image quality to assess cerebrospinal fluid spaces (CSF) and midline structures but not to exclude subtle parenchymal pathologies. Patients without focal neurological deficits often undergo CCT before lumbar puncture (LP) to exclude contraindications to LP including brain herniation or increased CSF pressure. We performed LD-CCT to assess if image quality is appropriate for this indication. METHODS A total of 58 LD-CCT (220 mA/120 kV) of patients before LP were retrospectively evaluated and compared to 79 normal standard dose cranial computed tomography (SD-CCT) (350 mA/120 kV). Iterative reconstruction used for both dose levels was increased by one factor for LD-CCT. We assessed the signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the dose estimates and scored diagnostic image quality by two raters independently. Significance level was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS The inner and outer CSF spaces except the sulci were equally well depicted by the LD-CCT and SD-CCT; however, depiction of the subtle density differences of the brain parenchyma and the sulci was significantly worse in the LD-CCT (p < 0.0001). The SNR in the gray matter (9.35 vs. 10.61, p < 0.05) and white matter (7.23 vs. 8.15, p < 0.001) were significantly lower in LD-CCT than in SD-CCT with significantly lower dose estimates (1.04 vs. 1.69 mSv, respectively p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION The use of LD-CCT with a dose reduction of almost 50% is sufficient to exclude contraindications to LP; however, LD-CCT cannot exclude subtle parenchymal pathologies. Therefore, in patients with suspected parenchymal pathology, SD-CCT is still the method of choice."

Comparison with unliganded and ATP-analogue-bound DHX36 structures, together with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, suggests that G-quadruplex binding alone induces rearrangements of the helicase core; by pulling on the single-stranded DNA tail, these rearrangements drive G-quadruplex unfolding one residue at a time."

DHX36 is a eukaryotic DEAH/RHA family helicase that disrupts G-quadruplex structures (G4s) with high specificity, contributing to regulatory roles of G4s. Here we used a DHX36 truncation to examine the roles of the 13-amino acid DHX36-specific motif (DSM) in DNA G4 recognition and disruption. We found that the DSM promotes G4 recognition and specificity by increasing the G4 binding rate of DHX36 without affecting the dissociation rate. Further, for most of the G4s measured, the DSM has little or no effect on the G4 disruption step by DHX36, implying that contacts with the G4 are maintained through the transition state for G4 disruption. This result suggests that partial disruption of the G4 from the 3' end is sufficient to reach the overall transition state for G4 disruption, while the DSM remains unperturbed at the 5' end. Interestingly, the DSM does not contribute to G4 binding kinetics or thermodynamics at low temperature, indicating a highly modular function. Together, our results animate recent DHX36 crystal structures, suggesting a model in which the DSM recruits G4s in a modular and flexible manner by contacting the 5' face early in binding, prior to rate-limiting capture and disruption of the G4 by the helicase core."

In this review we provide an overview of the current knowledge about DHX36 structure, substrate specificity, and mechanism of action based on the available models and crystal structures. Moreover, we outline its multiple functions in cellular homeostasis, immunity, and disease. Finally, we discuss the open questions and provide potential directions for future research."

Because of high stability and slow unfolding rates of G-quadruplexes (G4), cells have evolved specialized helicases that disrupt these non-canonical DNA and RNA structures in an ATP-dependent manner. One example is DHX36, a DEAH-box helicase, which participates in gene expression and replication by recognizing and unwinding parallel G4s. Here, we studied the molecular basis for the high affinity and specificity of DHX36 for parallel-type G4s using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. By computing binding free energies, we found that the two main G4-interacting subdomains of DHX36, DSM and OB, separately exhibit high G4 affinity but they act cooperatively to recognize two distinctive features of parallel G4s: the exposed planar face of a guanine tetrad and the unique backbone conformation of a continuous guanine tract, respectively. Our results also show that DSM-mediated interactions are the main contributor to the binding free energy and rely on making extensive van der Waals contacts between the GXXXG motifs and hydrophobic residues of DSM and a flat guanine plane. Accordingly, the sterically more accessible 5'-G-tetrad allows for more favorable van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions which leads to the preferential binding of DSM to the 5'-side. In contrast to DSM, OB binds to G4 mostly through polar interactions by flexibly adapting to the 5'-terminal guanine tract to form a number of strong hydrogen bonds with the backbone phosphate groups. We also identified a third DHX36/G4 interaction site formed by the flexible loop missing in the crystal structure."

Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA regions that include at least four closely spaced runs of three or more consecutive guanosines strongly tend to fold into stable G-quadruplexes (G4s). G4s play key roles as DNA regulatory sites and as kinetic traps that can inhibit biological processes, but how G4s are regulated in cells remains largely unknown. Here, we developed a kinetic framework for G4 disruption by DEAH-box helicase 36 (DHX36), the dominant G4 resolvase in human cells. Using tetramolecular DNA and RNA G4s with four to six G-quartets, we found that DHX36-mediated disruption is highly efficient, with rates that depend on G4 length under saturating conditions (kcat) but not under subsaturating conditions (kcat/K ). These results suggest that a step during G4 disruption limits the kcat value and that DHX36 binding limits kcat/K Similar results were obtained for unimolecular DNA G4s. DHX36 activity depended on a 3' ssDNA extension and was blocked by a polyethylene glycol linker, indicating that DHX36 loads onto the extension and translocates 3'-5' toward the G4. DHX36 unwound dsDNA poorly compared with G4s of comparable intrinsic lifetime. Interestingly, we observed that DHX36 has striking 3'-extension sequence preferences that differ for G4 disruption and dsDNA unwinding, most likely arising from differences in the rate-limiting step for the two activities. Our results indicate that DHX36 disrupts G4s with a conventional helicase mechanism that is tuned for great efficiency and specificity for G4s. The dependence of DHX36 on the 3'-extension sequence suggests that the extent of formation of genomic G4s may not track directly with G4 stability."

Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis is a highly orchestrated process involving numerous assembly factors including ATP-dependent RNA helicases. The DEAH helicase DHX37 (Dhr1 in yeast) is activated by the ribosome biogenesis factor UTP14A to facilitate maturation of the small ribosomal subunit. We report the crystal structure of DHX37 in complex with single-stranded RNA, revealing a canonical DEAH ATPase/helicase architecture complemented by a structurally unique carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Structural comparisons of the nucleotide-free DHX37-RNA complex with DEAH helicases bound to RNA and ATP analogs reveal conformational changes resulting in a register shift in the bound RNA, suggesting a mechanism for ATP-dependent 3'-5' RNA translocation. We further show that a conserved sequence motif in UTP14A interacts with and activates DHX37 by stimulating its ATPase activity and enhancing RNA binding. In turn, the CTD of DHX37 is required, but not sufficient, for interaction with UTP14A in vitro and is essential for ribosome biogenesis in vivo. Together, these results shed light on the mechanism of DHX37 and the function of UTP14A in controlling its recruitment and activity during ribosome biogenesis."

The unwinding of nucleic acid secondary structures within cells is crucial to maintain genomic integrity and prevent abortive transcription and translation initiation. DHX36, also known as RHAU or G4R1, is a DEAH-box ATP-dependent helicase highly specific for DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s). A fundamental mechanistic understanding of the interaction between helicases and their G4 substrates is important to elucidate G4 biology and pave the way toward G4-targeted therapies. Here we analyze how the thermodynamic stability of G4 substrates affects binding and unwinding by DHX36. We modulated the stability of the G4 substrates by varying the sequence and the number of G-tetrads and by using small, G4-stabilizing molecules. We found an inverse correlation between the thermodynamic stability of the G4 substrates and rates of unwinding by DHX36. In stark contrast, the ATPase activity of the helicase was largely independent of substrate stability pointing toward a decoupling mechanism akin to what has been observed for many double-stranded DEAD-box RNA helicases. Our study provides the first evidence that DHX36 uses a local, non-processive mechanism to unwind G4 substrates, reminiscent of that of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) on double-stranded substrates."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are frequently dysregulated in a variety of human cancers. However, their biological roles in these cancers remain incompletely understood. In this study, we analyze the gene expression profiles of colon cancer tissues and identify a previously unannotated lncRNA, FLJ39051, that we term GSEC (G-quadruplex-forming sequence containing lncRNA), as a lncRNA that is upregulated in colorectal cancer. We further demonstrate that knockdown of GSEC results in the reduction of colon cancer cell motility. We also show that GSEC binds to the DEAH box polypeptide 36 (DHX36) RNA helicase via its G-quadruplex-forming sequence and inhibits DHX36 G-quadruplex unwinding activity. Moreover, knockdown of DHX36 restores the reduced migratory activity of colon cancer cells caused by GSEC knockdown. These results suggest that GSEC plays an important role in colon cancer cell migration by inhibiting the function of DHX36 via its G-quadruplex structure."

INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome. Standard treatment is based on immunosuppressive, cytotoxic drugs and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in primary HLH. Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) plays a key pathogenic role. Emapalumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IFN-\u03b3, is the first target therapy approved for primary HLH with refractory, recurrent or progressive disease or intolerance to conventional therapy. AREAS COVERED We reviewed the pharmacological characteristics, safety, efficacy and clinical uses of emapalumab. We summarized the results of current standard treatment based on chemo-immunosuppressive protocols and outlined the alternative options available. EXPERT OPINION Emapalumab is an effective treatment for HLH with a good safety profile. Its efficacy was demonstrated in a phase II/III study on primary HLH pediatric patients with refractory, relapsing HLH or intolerance to first-line treatment. The use of emapalumab allowed most patients to proceed to HSCT, with a high estimated probability of survival 12 months after transplantation. The outcomes in patients who underwent transplantation compare favorably with those reported previously with either myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. The potential role of emapalumab in the treatment of secondary HLH and as a prevention of graft failure after HSCT deserves to be further assessed."

BACKGROUND Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare syndrome characterized by immune dysregulation and hyperinflammation. It typically manifests in infancy and is associated with high mortality. METHODS We investigated the efficacy and safety of emapalumab (a human anti-interferon-\u03b3 antibody), administered with dexamethasone, in an open-label, single-group, phase 2-3 study involving patients who had received conventional therapy before enrollment (previously treated patients) and previously untreated patients who were 18 years of age or younger and had primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The patients could enter a long-term follow-up study until 1 year after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or until 1 year after the last dose of emapalumab, if transplantation was not performed. The planned 8-week treatment period could be shortened or extended if needed according to the timing of transplantation. The primary efficacy end point was the overall response, which was assessed in the previously treated patients according to objective clinical and laboratory criteria. RESULTS At the cutoff date of July 20, 2017, a total of 34 patients (27 previously treated patients and 7 previously untreated patients) had received emapalumab; 26 patients completed the study. A total of 63% of the previously treated patients and 65% of the patients who received an emapalumab infusion had a response; these percentages were significantly higher than the prespecified null hypothesis of 40% (P = 0.02 and P = 0.005, respectively). In the previously treated group, 70% of the patients were able to proceed to transplantation, as were 65% of the patients who received emapalumab. At the last observation, 74% of the previously treated patients and 71% of the patients who received emapalumab were alive. Emapalumab was not associated with any organ toxicity. Severe infections developed in 10 patients during emapalumab treatment. Emapalumab was discontinued in 1 patient because of disseminated histoplasmosis. CONCLUSIONS Emapalumab was an efficacious targeted therapy for patients with primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

Secondary HLH includes infection- (eg viral/bacterial/fungal/parasitic) and non-infection- (eg collagen disease or malignancy) related diseases. Viral HLH is the major type among all age groups. Secondary viral HLH and primary HLH must be differentiated carefully because primary HLH can be associated with viral infection(s), and the outcome is dismal without a timely diagnosis and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related HLH (EBV-HLH) is the most common type of viral HLH in childhood. For non-EBV-HLH, appropriate treatment of viral infection, followed by immunomodulatory agent(s) such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin or cyclosporine A, is usually successful; however, recent SARS-CoV-2-related HLH may become life-threatening. EBV-HLH may occur heterogeneously associated with the primary infection, with chronic active EBV infection or with underlying primary HLH. Although immunomodulatory agent(s) are effective in the majority of EBV-HLH cases, management differs from that of non-EBV-HLH because severe and refractory cases may require etoposide-containing HLH-1994/2004 regimens or other experimental agents. The novel agent, emapalumab (an anti-IFN-\u03b3 monoclonal antibody) can be used to treat EBV-HLH cases to avoid the risk of secondary malignancy due to etoposide. Finally, HSCT is required for refractory EBV-HLH cases and can also be curative in some other cases."

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of excessive immune system activation driven mainly by high levels of interferon gamma. The clinical presentation of HLH can have considerable overlap with other inflammatory conditions. We present a cohort of patients with therapy refractory HLH referred to our center who were found to have a simultaneous presentation of complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Twenty-three patients had therapy refractory HLH (13 primary, 4 EVB-HLH, 6 HLH without known trigger). Sixteen (69.6%) met high-risk TMA criteria. Renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, severe hypertension, serositis, and gastrointestinal bleeding were documented only in patients with HLH who had concomitant complement-mediated TMA. Patients with HLH and without TMA required ventilator support mainly due to CNS symptoms, while those with HLH and TMA had respiratory failure predominantly associated with pulmonary hypertension, a known presentation of pulmonary TMA. Ten patients received eculizumab for complement-mediated TMA management while being treated for HLH. All patients who received the complement blocker eculizumab in addition to the interferon gamma blocker emapalumab had complete resolution of their TMA and survived. Our observations suggest co-activation of both interferon and complement pathways as a potential culprit in the evolution of thrombotic microangiopathy in patients with inflammatory disorders like refractory HLH and may offer novel therapeutic approaches for these critically ill patients. TMA should be considered in children with HLH and multi-organ failure, as an early institution of a brief course of complement blocking therapy in addition to HLH-targeted therapy may improve clinical outcomes in these patients."

Clinicians should put on appropriate personal protective equipment before performing the death by neurologic criteria evaluation. Risk of aerosol generation and viral transmission during the apnea test can be mitigated by using continuous positive airway pressure delivered via the ventilator as a means of apneic oxygenation. Physicians should assess the risk of transporting coronavirus disease 2019 patients to the nuclear medicine suite to perform a radionucleotide cerebral blood flow study, as disconnections to and from the ventilator for transport and inadvertent ventilator disconnections during transport can increase transmission risk. CONCLUSIONS When conducting the neurologic examination and apnea test required for death by neurologic criteria determination in patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019, appropriate modifications are needed to mitigate the risk of viral transmission and ensure patient safety."

OBJECTIVE To review practices of brain death (BD) determination in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS A systematic search was applied to PubMed and 6 electronic databases from inception to May 22, 2019. Studies reporting methods of BD assessment in adult patients (>18 years old) while on ECMO were included, after which data regarding BD assessment were extracted. RESULTS Twenty-two studies (n = 177 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Eighty-eight patients (50%) in 19 studies underwent the apnea test (AT); most commonly through decreasing the ECMO sweep flow in 14 studies (n = 42, 48%), followed by providing CO2 through the ventilator in 2 studies (n = 6, 7%), and providing CO2 through the ECMO oxygenator in 1 study (n = 1, 1%). The details of the AT were not reported in 2 studies (n = 39, 44%). In 19 patients (22%), the AT was nonconfirmatory due to hemodynamic instability, hypoxia, insufficient CO2 rise, or unreliability of the AT. A total of 157 ancillary tests were performed, including electroencephalogram (62%), computed tomography angiography (22%), transcranial Doppler ultrasound (6%), cerebral blood flow nuclear study (5%), cerebral angiography (4%), and other (1%). Forty-seven patients (53% of patients with AT) with confirmatory AT still underwent additional ancillary for BD confirmation. Only 21 patients (12% of all patients) were declared brain-dead using confirmatory ATs alone without ancillary testing. CONCLUSIONS Performing AT for patients with ECMO was associated with high failure rate and hemodynamic complications. Our study highlights the variability in practice in regard to the AT and supports the use of ancillary tests to determine BD in patients on ECMO."

The apnea test, which involves disconnection from the mechanical ventilator, presents risks during the determination of brain death, especially in hypoxemic patients. We describe the performance of the apnea test without disconnection from the mechanical ventilator in two patients. The first case involved an 8-year-old boy admitted with severe hypoxemia due to pneumonia. He presented with cardiorespiratory arrest, followed by unresponsive coma due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Two clinical exams revealed the absence of brainstem reflexes, and transcranial Doppler ultrasound revealed brain circulatory arrest. Three attempts were made to perform the apnea test, which were interrupted by hypoxemia; therefore, the apnea test was performed without disconnection from the mechanical ventilator, adjusting the continuous airway pressure to 10cmH2O and the inspired fraction of oxygen to 100%. The oxygen saturation was maintained at 100% for 10 minutes. Posttest blood gas analysis results were as follows: pH, 6.90; partial pressure of oxygen, 284.0mmHg; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 94.0mmHg; and oxygen saturation, 100%. The second case involved a 43-year-old woman admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage (Hunt-Hess V and Fisher IV). Two clinical exams revealed unresponsive coma and absence of all brainstem reflexes. Brain scintigraphy showed no radioisotope uptake into the brain parenchyma. The first attempt at the apnea test was stopped after 5 minutes due to hypothermia (34.9\u00b0C). After rewarming, the apnea test was repeated without disconnection from the mechanical ventilator, showing maintenance of the functional residual volume with electrical bioimpedance. Posttest blood gas analysis results were as follows: pH, 7.01; partial pressure of oxygen, 232.0mmHg; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 66.9mmHg; and oxygen saturation, 99.0%. The apnea test without disconnection from the mechanical ventilator allowed the preservation of oxygenation in both cases. The use of continuous airway pressure during the apnea test seems to be a safe alternative in order to maintain alveolar recruitment and oxygenation during brain death determination."

BACKGROUND Although the new Practice Parameters for brain death support a single examination, there is paucity of data comparing its impact to dual brain death (DBD) examinations. METHODS We reviewed all brain deaths in our hospital over a 39-month period and compared the optional single brain death (SBD) exam requiring an apnea and a mandatory confirmatory blood flow test to the DBD for organ function at the time of death, rate of donation, and cost. RESULTS Thirty-six patients had a SBD and 59 DBD exams, without any of them regaining neurological functioning. There was no difference in serum electrolytes (except for higher Na(+) and Cl(-) in the SBD group), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, blood gases, incidence of diabetes insipidus, apnea completion, consent for donation, and organs recovered and transplanted. During the second BD exam, 35% of patients with DBD were on higher dose of vasopressors, but had lower systolic blood pressure (P = 0.046). For DBD patients, the mean interval between the two exams was 14.4 h, which contributed to a higher cost of $43,707.67 compared to SBD. There was a trend for increased consent rates (adjusted for age, race, and type of exam) when patients were declared by the neurointensivist service following a strict family approach protocol (P = 0.06). CONCLUSION SBD exam is easier, faster to perform, with no brain function recovery and leads to similar donation rates, equivalent or better organ function status at the time of BD and lower cost than conventional DBD exams."

Forty years after the publication of a landmark paper by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School, the general concept of brain death has achieved widespread acceptance. In the United States, irreversible dysfunction of the brain and brainstem are required for the diagnosis of brain death. Although primarily based on clinical evaluation, confirmatory examinations, including radionuclide blood flow studies, play an important role in augmenting the physical examination in special situations when some of its specific components cannot be performed or reliably evaluated. The 2 main radionuclidic techniques used in evaluation of brain death are radionuclide angiography with nonlipophilic radiopharmaceuticals and parenchymal imaging with lipophilic agents. Specific technical guidelines for determination of brain death have been promulgated by professional medical societies. In the vast majority of cases, blood flow examinations are useful in confirming brain death. Nonetheless, on occasion patients clinically diagnosed with brain death will exhibit persistent intracranial blood flow or electrical activity. Existence of these contradictory cases reveals underlying inconsistencies in the definitions of brain death. We hypothesize that the existence of these apparent contradictions is related to differences in sensitivity of the physical examination and the confirmatory examinations, differences in localization of the physical examination and confirmatory tests, and differences between blood flow and cerebral function as markers of brain death."

OBJECTIVES Decompressive craniectomy is occasionally performed for patients with impending brain death, which is intended to relieve critically elevated intracranial pressure to keep effective intracranial perfusion. It has been in debate if this surgery later affects the result of brain perfusion scintigraphy performed as an ancillary test in the course of brain death diagnosis because rigid closed skull is deemed essential to elevate intracranial pressure to the point of total absence of intracranial radiotracer uptake on scintigraphy. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the impact of decompressive craniectomy on the result of brain perfusion scintigraphy in patients with suspected brain death. METHODS This retrospective cross-sectional study included consecutive 151 brain perfusion scintigraphy performed in 138 patients with suspected brain death from various causes (male 82 patients, female 56 patients; range 0-74 years; mean age 36.6 years). All exams were indicated due to inconclusive clinical diagnosis of brain death. The scintigraphy protocol consists of immediate flow phase and delayed parenchymal phase planar imaging. Additional SPECT imaging was performed in 15 studies in 14 patients. The results, positive or negative brain flow, were compared between patients with and without decompressive craniectomy using Chi-squared test. As there were patients with repeat studies, analysis was performed for both initial and final exam results. Same dataset was used for initial and final exams in patients with only one exam. RESULTS Out of 138 patients, 15 patients underwent decompressive craniectomy (11%) and 123 patients were managed medically (89%). On the initial exam, negative brain flow was demonstrated in 11 of 15 patients with craniectomy (73.3%) and 106 of 123 patients without craniectomy (86.2%). On the final exam, negative brain flow was demonstrated 12 of 15 patients with craniectomy (80%) and 111 of 123 patients without craniectomy (90.2%). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on both initial and final exams (p = 0.19 and 0.23, respectively). CONCLUSION In patients with suspected brain death, history of decompressive craniectomy does not affect the result of brain perfusion scintigraphy."

RESULTS Details provided on the performance and interpretation of ancillary tests for determination of BD/DNC were variably provided and inconsistent. Approximately half of all protocols that included each ancillary test provided details about study performance: 63% of protocols that included conventional cerebral angiography, 55% of protocols that included electroencephalography, 50% of protocols that included somatosensory evoked potentials, 48% of protocols that included transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, 43% of protocols that included nuclear medicine flow study and 41% of protocols that included brainstem auditory evoked potentials.

OBJECTIVE To review and revise the 1987 pediatric brain death guidelines. METHODS Relevant literature was reviewed. Recommendations were developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (1) Determination of brain death in term newborns, infants, and children is a clinical diagnosis based on the absence of neurologic function with a known irreversible cause of coma. Because of insufficient data in the literature, recommendations for preterm infants <37 weeks gestational age are not included in these guidelines. (2) Hypotension, hypothermia, and metabolic disturbances should be treated and corrected, and medications that can interfere with the neurologic examination and apnea testing should be discontinued allowing for adequate clearance before proceeding with these evaluations. (3) Two examinations including apnea testing with each examination separated by an observation period are required. Examinations should be performed by different attending physicians. Apnea testing may be performed by the same physician. An observation period of 24 hours for term newborns (37 weeks gestational age) to 30 days of age and 12 hours for infants and children (>30 days to 18 years) is recommended. The first examination determines the child has met the accepted neurologic examination criteria for brain death. The second examination confirms brain death based on an unchanged and irreversible condition. Assessment of neurologic function after cardiopulmonary resuscitation or other severe acute brain injuries should be deferred for 24 hours or longer if there are concerns or inconsistencies in the examination. (4) Apnea testing to support the diagnosis of brain death must be performed safely and requires documentation of an arterial PaCO(2) 20mmHg above the baseline and \u226560mmHg with no respiratory effort during the testing period. If the apnea test cannot be safely completed, an ancillary study should be performed. (5) Ancillary studies (electroencephalogram and radionuclide cerebral blood flow) are not required to establish brain death and are not a substitute for the neurologic examination. Ancillary studies may be used to assist the clinician in making the diagnosis of brain death (a) when components of the examination or apnea testing cannot be completed safely due to the underlying medical condition of the patient; (b) if there is uncertainty about the results of the neurologic examination; (c) if a medication effect may be present; or (d) to reduce the interexamination observation period. When ancillary studies are used, a second clinical examination and apnea test should be performed, and components that can be completed must remain consistent with brain death. In this instance, the observation interval may be shortened, and the second neurologic examination and apnea test (or all components that are able to be completed safely) can be performed at any time thereafter. (6) Death is declared when these above criteria are fulfilled."

BACKGROUND In Canada, ancillary tests, such as selective four vessels angiography (S4VA), are sometimes necessary for brain death (BD) diagnosis when the clinical exam cannot be completed or confounding factors are present. Recent Canadian guidelines assert that brain death is supported by the absence of arterial blood flow at the surface of the brain and that venous return should not be considered. However, neuropathologic and angiographic studies have suggested that arteries might still be patent in BD patients. Current clinical practices in BD diagnosis following S4VA need to be better understood. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of all S4VA performed for the determination of BD in a level 1 NeuroTrauma centre from 2003 to 2007. The objective of the study was to describe the prevalence of intracranial arterial, capillary (parenchymogram) and venous opacification in our study population. All tests were reviewed independently by two neuroradiologists. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. RESULTS Thirty two patients were declared BD following S4VA during the study period. Nine of these patients (28%) presented some proximal opacification of intracranial arteries (95% CI 15-45%). As opposed, none had a cerebral capillary and deep venous drainage opacification (95% CI 0-10%). CONCLUSION The absence of cerebral deep venous drainage or parenchymogram might represent a better objective marker of cerebral circulatory arrest for brain death diagnosis when the use of S4VA is required. These findings open the path for further research in enhancing our interpretation of angiographic studies for brain death diagnosis."

Although BCMA has generally been considered to be expressed almost exclusively in plasma cells with a low likelihood of on-target off-tumor toxicity, there has been a range of unusual neurotoxicity observed across the spectrum of BCMA immunotherapies.

METHODS MAICs were performed with individual patient data for cilta-cel (CARTITUDE-1; NCT03548207) and published summary-level data for ide-cel (KarMMa; NCT03361748). Treated patients from CARTITUDE-1 who satisfied the eligibility criteria for KarMMa were included in the analyses.

Comparative efficacy was estimated for overall response rate (ORR), complete response or better (\u2265CR) rate, duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Cilta-cel was associated with statistically significantly improved ORR (odds ratio [OR]: 94.93 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.86, 412.25; p < .0001]; relative risk [RR]: 1.34), \u2265CR rate (OR: 5.49 [95% CI: 2.47, 12.21; p < .0001]; RR: 2.21), DoR (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.50 [95% CI: 0.29, 0.87; p = .0137]), and PFS (HR: 0.37 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.62; p = .0002]) when compared with ide-cel. For OS, the results were in favor of cilta-cel and clinically meaningful but with a CI overlapping one (HR: 0.55 [95% CI: 0.29, 1.05; p = .0702]).

Whereas the treatment of MM was dependent solely on alkylating agents and corticosteroids during the prior three decades, the landscape of therapeutic measures to treat the disease began to expand enormously early in the current century. The introduction of new classes of small-molecule drugs, such as proteasome blockers (bortezomib and carfilzomib), immunomodulators (lenalidomide and pomalidomide), nuclear export inhibitors (selinexor), and histone deacetylase blockers (panobinostat), as well as the application of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), resulted in a seismic shift in how the disease is treated. The picture changed dramatically once again starting with the 2015 FDA approval of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) - the anti-CD38 daratumumab and the anti-SLAMF7 elotuzumab. Daratumumab, in particular, has had a great impact on MM therapy and today is often included in various regimens to treat the disease, both in newly diagnosed cases and in the relapse/refractory setting. Recently, other immunotherapies have been added to the arsenal of drugs available to fight this malignancy. These include isatuximab (also anti-CD38) and, in the past year, the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) belantamab mafodotin and the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel). While the accumulated benefits of these newer agents have resulted in a doubling of the disease's five-year survival rate to more than 5 years and improved quality of life, the disease remains incurable. Almost without exception patients experience relapse and/or become refractory to the drugs used, making the search for innovative therapies all the more essential. This review covers the current scope of anti-myeloma immunotherapeutic agents, both those in clinical use and on the horizon, including naked mAbs, ADCs, bi- and multi-targeted mAbs, and CAR T-cells. Emphasis is placed on the benefits of each along with the challenges that need to be overcome if MM is to be considered curable in the future."

BACKGROUND Idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, also called bb2121), a B-cell maturation antigen-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has shown clinical activity with expected CAR T-cell toxic effects in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS In this phase 2 study, we sought to confirm the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma. Patients with disease after at least three previous regimens including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 antibody were enrolled. Patients received ide-cel target doses of 150 \u00d7 106 to 450 \u00d7 106 CAR-positive (CAR+) T cells. The primary end point was an overall response (partial response or better); a key secondary end point was a complete response or better (comprising complete and stringent complete responses). RESULTS Of 140 patients enrolled, 128 received ide-cel. At a median follow-up of 13.3 months, 94 of 128 patients (73%) had a response, and 42 of 128 (33%) had a complete response or better. Minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status (<10-5 nucleated cells) was confirmed in 33 patients, representing 26% of all 128 patients who were treated and 79% of the 42 patients who had a complete response or better. The median progression-free survival was 8.8 months (95% confidence interval, 5.6 to 11.6). Common toxic effects among the 128 treated patients included neutropenia in 117 patients (91%), anemia in 89 (70%), and thrombocytopenia in 81 (63%). Cytokine release syndrome was reported in 107 patients (84%), including 7 (5%) who had events of grade 3 or higher. Neurotoxic effects developed in 23 patients (18%) and were of grade 3 in 4 patients (3%); no neurotoxic effects higher than grade 3 occurred. Cellular kinetic analysis confirmed CAR+ T cells in 29 of 49 patients (59%) at 6 months and 4 of 11 patients (36%) at 12 months after infusion. CONCLUSIONS Ide-cel induced responses in a majority of heavily pretreated patients with refractory and relapsed myeloma; MRD-negative status was achieved in 26% of treated patients. Almost all patients had grade 3 or 4 toxic effects, most commonly hematologic toxic effects and cytokine release syndrome.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Registrational trials for ciltacabtagene autoleucel [cilta-cel]) and idecabtagene vicleucel [ide-cel] chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies were single-arm studies conducted with relapse refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patients who were triple-class-exposed (TCE) or triple-class-refractory (TCR). It is critical for researchers conducting comparative effectiveness research (CER) to carefully consider the most appropriate data sources and comparable patient populations. The aim of this study was to identify potential data sources and populations for comparing to single-arm CAR-T trials CARTITUDE-1 (cilta-cel) and KarMMa (ide-cel). METHODS A 2-part global systematic literature search produced a review of (1) clinical trials of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline preferred regimens in previously treated MM, and (2) real-world data cohorts of TCE or TCR populations, published between 1/1/2015 and 12/10/2020, with sample sizes of > 50 patients and reporting survival-related outcomes. Implications on CER and accepted best practices are discussed. RESULTS Nine clinical trials of NCCN preferred regimens were identified along with five real-world data-based publications. No clinical trials evaluated patients with TCE or TCR MM. Among the real-world data-based publications, two evaluated patients exclusively with TCR MM, two analyzed a mixed population of patients with TCE or TCR MM, and one publication assessed patients exclusively with TCE MM. Real-world data treatment patterns were heterogeneous. CONCLUSION Current NCCN preferred regimens were not specifically studied in TCE or TCR MM patients, although some studies do include a proportion of these types of patients. Therefore, appropriate matching of populations using either real-world data or patient level clinical trial data is critical to putting trials of novel CAR-Ts (i.e., CARTITUDE-1 or KarMMa) into appropriate comparative context."

The development of several treatment options over the last 2 decades has led to a notable improvement in the survival of patients with multiple myeloma. Despite these advances, the disease remains incurable for most patients. Moreover, standard combinations of alkylating agents, immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies targeting CD38 and corticoids are exhausted relatively fast in a proportion of high-risk patients. Such high-risk patients account for over 20% of cases and currently represent a major unmet medical need. The challenge of drug resistance requires the development of highly active new agents with a radically different mechanism of action. Several immunotherapeutic modalities, including antibody-drug conjugates and T-cell engagers, appear to be promising choices for patients who develop resistance to standard combinations. Chimeric antigen-receptor-modified T cells (CAR-Ts) targeting B-cell maturation antigen have demonstrated encouraging efficacy and an acceptable safety profile compared with alternative options. Multiple CAR-Ts are in early stages of clinical development, but the first phase III trials with CAR-Ts are ongoing for two of them. After the recent publication of the results of a phase II trial confirming a notable efficacy and acceptable safety profile, idecabtagene vicleucel is the first CAR-T to gain regulatory US Food and Drug Administration approval to treat refractory multiple myeloma patients who have already been exposed to antibodies against CD38, proteasome inhibitors, and immunomodulatory agents and who are refractory to the last therapy. Here, we will discuss the preclinical and clinical development of idecabtagene vicleucel and its future role in the changing treatment landscape of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma."

Idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, bb2121), a BCMA-directed CAR T-cell therapy, demonstrated efficacy in triple-class exposed RRMM patients in the KarMMa trial (NCT03361748).

Endpoints included overall response rate (ORR; primary), rate of very good partial response or better (\u2265VGPR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Of 1949 real-world triple-class exposed RRMM patients, 190 received subsequent (index) line of therapy and met KarMMa eligibility criteria (Eligible RRMM cohort). With a median follow-up of 13.3 months in KarMMa and 10.2 months in Eligible RRMM, ORR, and \u2265VGPR were significantly improved in KarMMa versus Eligible RRMM (ORR, 76.4% vs 32.2%; \u2265VGPR, 57.9% vs 13.7%; both P < 0.0001) as were PFS (11.6 vs 3.5 months; P = 0.0004) and OS (20.2 vs 14.7 months; P = 0.0006).

AIM to comparatively evaluate the hypotensive effect of minimally invasive (type 1) and basic (type 2) subscleral removing of the external wall of Schlemm's canal with subsequent laser trabeculopuncture in patients with open-angle glaucoma (POAG). MATERIAL AND METHODS The main group included 60 patients (64 eyes) treated with the minimally invasive technique. The control group included 105 patients (105 eyes), who underwent the type 2 surgery. RESULTS After sinusotomy, intraocular pressure (IOP) decreased by 25% of its preoperative values in most patients (in 90.6% of patients from the main group and 81.9% of the controls, p<0.05). After laser trabeculopuncture, IOP further decreased down to 15.6\u00b10.4 mmHg in the main group and 17.4\u00b10.3 mmHg in the control group (p<0.05). Twelve months after the combined treatment, the hypotensive effect was still present in 81.2% of patients from the main group and 90.5% of the controls.

Schlemm's canal (SC) is a unique vascular structure that functions to maintain fluid homeostasis by draining aqueous humor from the eye into the systemic circulation. The endothelium lining the inner wall of SC has both blood and lymphatic vascular characteristics, thus prompting exploration of the development and regulation of this unique channel. In this issue of the JCI, back-to-back papers by Aspelund et al. and Park et al. detail the mechanisms of SC development, which includes a lymphatic reprogramming that is necessary to maintain proper function. Furthermore, both groups exploit the lymph-like qualities of this canal: they identify VEGF-C as a potential therapeutic for glaucoma and suggest that expression of PROX1, a marker of lymphatic fate, could also serve as a biosensor for monitoring SC integrity. These studies provide substantial insight into the molecular and cellular pathways that govern SC development and reveal that ocular pathology is associated with deregulation of the lymph-like characteristics of SC."

We have tried to answer the question of whether the endothelium of Schlemm's canal is derived from and retains properties of blood vessels by studying: (1) the development of Schlemm's canal in human fetal eyes; (2) the existence of Weibel-Palade bodies in human neonatal, adult human and adult monkey eyes; and (3) the presence of blood coagulation Factor VIII-related antigen in adult human and monkey eyes. (1) We observed that the intrascleral plexus of the limbal region extended deep into the sclera forming a deep scleral plexus by the 17th week of gestation. After 17 weeks gestation, extensions from the deep scleral plexus had reached the region of the future corneoscleral meshwork where the trabecular cells appeared oriented circumferentially. The blind endings of these extensions appeared to grow circumferentially in the supposed region of Schlemm's canal and at 27 weeks gestation they formed an incomplete Schlemm's canal. A complete Schlemm's canal was observed in some sections of the limbal region at 28 weeks gestation and at approximately 40 weeks gestation the canal was complete in most sections. (2) Weibel-Palade bodies were found in the endothelium of aqueous veins and in the inner and outer wall endothelium of Schlemm's canal. (3) Blood coagulation Factor VIII-related antigen was detected in the endothelium of the collector channels and Schlemm's canal, as well as in the blood vessels of the other parts of the eye. Our results indicate that the endothelium of Schlemm's canal is derived from a vascular origin and that even in the adult eye it retains some of the properties of a blood vessel."

Schlemm's canal (SC) is a specialized vascular structure in the eye that functions to drain aqueous humor from the intraocular chamber into systemic circulation. Dysfunction of SC has been proposed to underlie increased aqueous humor outflow (AHO) resistance, which leads to elevated ocular pressure, a factor for glaucoma development in humans. Here, using lymphatic and blood vasculature reporter mice, we determined that SC, which originates from blood vessels during the postnatal period, acquires lymphatic identity through upregulation of prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1), the master regulator of lymphatic development. SC expressed lymphatic valve markers FOXC2 and integrin \u03b19 and exhibited continuous vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) junctions and basement membrane, similar to collecting lymphatics. SC notably lacked luminal valves and expression of the lymphatic endothelial cell markers podoplanin and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1). Using an ocular puncture model, we determined that reduced AHO altered the fate of SC both during development and under pathologic conditions; however, alteration of VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling did not modulate SC integrity and identity. Intriguingly, PROX1 expression levels linearly correlated with SC functionality. For example, PROX1 expression was reduced or undetectable under pathogenic conditions and in deteriorated SCs. Collectively, our data indicate that PROX1 is an accurate and reliable biosensor of SC integrity and identity."

Iontophoresis is less apt to prove the existence of outflow channels of aqueous humour, but it is appropriate in demonstrating filtering blebs. After injecting fluorescein directly into the anterior chamber, the outflow channels are clearly marked in enucleated non-glaucomatous eyes, as well as in eyes containing a tumor, prior to enucleation. Regularly, one is able to observe sectors in which the aqueous veins are filled slowly or not filled at all. Injecting fluorescein directly in Schlemm's canal proves that in cadaver eyes without glaucoma the lumen is open all around. Sectorial filling defects of vessels leading out of Schlemm's canal are often seen. In three patients with simple glaucoma blocking of dye was noticed during passage through Schlemm's canal without reappearance. Our experiments give the impression that segmental division of Schlemm's canal is more marked in eyes with glaucoma than in normal eyes. If local occlusions within Schlemm's canal are of importance for the range of lowering of intraocular pressure, one must differentiate between the trabecular and the intrascleral part of the resistance of outflow in the operation field, in order to choose the best operating procedure. Such a differentiation seems, in principle, possible using fluorescein--primarily injected into the anterior chamber directly, and secondarily into a given part of Schlemm's canal."

METHODS This retrospective case series included patients with PCG who underwent trabeculotomy using an illuminated microcatheter with the intent of catheterizing the full circumference of Schlemm's canal in a single procedure. Success was defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) \u226421 mmHg, with or without the use of glaucoma medications. Clinical examination data were collected for up to 36 months postoperatively. RESULTS Surgery was performed on 16 eyes of 16 patients. The mean patient age was 75.1 \u00b1 69.4 months (range: 4.0-216.0 months). Complete catheterization was achieved in 11 of the 16 eyes (69%), whereas partial catheterization was achieved in five of the 16 eyes (31%). All eyes had previously undergone surgery for PCG. The mean follow-up duration was 20.3 \u00b1 9.0 months (range, 12.0-36.0 months). IOP was reduced from a mean of 31.8 \u00b1 6.6 mmHg preoperatively to 15.6 \u00b1 3.7 mmHg at the final follow-up (P < 0.001).

PARTICIPANTS Thirty-six pairs of dissected anterior segments from donated human eye bank eyes without glaucoma were studied. A baseline measurement was collected from each eye to serve as its control. METHODS Using a constant pressure perfusion method, outflow facility was measured in paired eyes from human donors.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Change in outflow facility from baseline or contralateral eye. RESULTS After Hydrus placement, the outflow facility increased from 0.23\u00b10.03 \u03bcl/minute per millimeter of mercury at baseline to 0.38\u00b10.03 \u03bcl/minute per millimeter of mercury (P < 0.001).

Both changes have therapeutic potential for patients with SCD. Here, we evaluated the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of mitapivat in adults with SCD with no recent blood transfusions or changes in hydroxyurea or l-glutamine therapy. Seventeen subjects were enrolled; 1 subject was withdrawn shortly after starting the study. Sixteen subjects completed 3 ascending dose levels of mitapivat (5, 20, and 50 mg, twice daily [BID]) for 2 weeks each; following a protocol amendment, the dose was escalated to 100 mg BID in 9 subjects. Mitapivat was well tolerated at all dose levels, with the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) being insomnia, headache, and hypertension. Six serious AEs (SAEs) included 4 vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), non-VOC-related shoulder pain, and a preexisting pulmonary embolism. Two VOCs occurred during drug taper and were possibly drug related; no other SAEs were drug related.

BACKGROUND Mitapivat, an oral activator of pyruvate kinase (PK) in red blood cells (RBCs), has shown significant improvements in haemoglobin and haemolysis among patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency who were not receiving regular transfusions. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mitapivat in adults with pyruvate kinase deficiency receiving regular transfusions. METHODS ACTIVATE-T was an open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trial conducted in 20 centres across Europe, North America, and Asia. Eligible participants were adults (aged \u226518 years) with a clinical laboratory confirmation of pyruvate kinase deficiency receiving regular transfusions (at least six episodes in the previous year). Participants received oral mitapivat during a 16-week dose-optimisation period (5 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg twice daily) and 24-week fixed-dose period. The primary endpoint was a reduction in transfusion burden (\u226533% reduction in number of RBC units transfused during the fixed-dose period, compared with the participant's individual historical transfusion burden, standardised to 24 weeks). Efficacy and safety were assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of mitapivat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03559699, and is complete. FINDINGS Between June 26, 2018, and Feb 4, 2020, 27 participants (20 [74%] female and seven [26%] male; 20 [74%] White, three [11%] Asian, and four [15%] not reported) were enrolled and received at least one dose of mitapivat. Median duration of exposure to mitapivat was 40\u00b73 weeks (IQR 40\u00b70-41\u00b73). A reduction in transfusion burden by at least 33% was found in ten (37%) participants (95% CI 19-58; p=0\u00b70002). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were increase in alanine aminotransferase (ten [37%] participants), headache (ten [37%]), increase in aspartate aminotransferase (five [19%]), fatigue (five [19%]), and nausea (five [19%]). Two grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were related to study treatment: joint swelling (one participant [4%]) and an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (one participant [4%]). Three participants had serious treatment-emergent adverse events, none related to the study treatment: increased blood triglycerides, ovarian cyst, and renal colic (each in one participant [4%]). No treatment-related deaths were observed. INTERPRETATION Mitapivat represents a novel therapy that can reduce transfusion burden in some adults with pyruvate kinase deficiency receiving regular transfusions, and is the first disease-modifying agent approved in this disease.

After years of reliance on transfusion alone to address anemia and suppress ineffective erythropoiesis in \u03b2-thalassemia, many new therapies are now in development. Luspatercept, a transforming growth factor-\u03b2 inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing ineffective erythropoiesis, improving anemia, and possibly reducing iron loading. However, many patients do not respond to luspatercept, so additional therapeutics are needed. Several medications in development aim to induce hemoglobin F (HbF): sirolimus, benserazide, and IMR-687 (a phosphodiesterase 9 inhibitor). Another group of agents seeks to ameliorate ineffective erythropoiesis and improve anemia by targeting abnormal iron metabolism in thalassemia: apotransferrin, VIT-2763 (a ferroportin inhibitor), PTG-300 (a hepcidin mimetic), and an erythroferrone antibody in early development. Mitapivat, a pyruvate kinase activator, represents a unique mechanism to mitigate ineffective erythropoiesis. Genetically modified autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers the potential for lifelong transfusion independence. Through a gene addition approach, lentiviral vectors have been used to introduce a \u03b2-globin gene into autologous hematopoietic stem cells. One such product, betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel), has reached phase 3 trials with promising results. In addition, 2 gene editing techniques (CRISPR-Cas9 and zinc-finger nucleases) are under investigation as a means to silence BCL11A to induce HbF with agents designated CTX001 and ST-400, respectively. Results from the many clinical trials for these agents will yield results in the next few years, which may end the era of relying on transfusion alone as the mainstay of thalassemia therapy."

Given these findings, mitapivat has the potential to be the first approved therapeutic for PKD. Mitapivat has additionally been evaluated in a phase II trial of patients with alpha- and beta-thalassemia and a phase I trial of patients with sickle cell disease, with findings suggesting safety and efficacy in these more common hereditary anemias. Following these successful early-phase trials, two phase III trials of mitapivat in thalassemia and a phase II/III trial of mitapivat in sickle cell disease are beginning worldwide. Promising preclinical studies have additionally been done evaluating mitapivat in hereditary spherocytosis, suggesting potential efficacy in erythrocyte membranopathies as well.

No approved disease-modifying therapies exist for these patients. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of mitapivat (Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA), a pyruvate kinase activator, in adults with non-transfusion-dependent (NTD) \u03b1-thalassaemia or NTD \u03b2-thalassaemia. METHODS In this open-label, multicentre, phase 2 study, patients were recruited from four academic clinical study sites in Oakland, CA, and Boston, MA, USA; Toronto, ON, Canada; and London, UK. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, with NTDT (including \u03b2-thalassaemia with or without \u03b1-globin gene mutations, haemoglobin E \u03b2-thalassaemia, or \u03b1-thalassaemia), and a baseline haemoglobin concentration of 10\u00b70 g/dL or lower. During a 24-week core period, mitapivat was administered orally at 50 mg twice daily for the first 6 weeks followed by an escalation to 100 mg twice daily for 18 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint was haemoglobin response (a \u22651\u00b70 g/dL increase in haemoglobin concentration from baseline at one or more assessments between weeks 4 and 12). Efficacy and safety were assessed in the full analysis set (ie, all patients who received at least one dose of study drug). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03692052, and is closed to accrual. FINDINGS Between Dec 28, 2018, and Feb 6, 2020, 27 patients were screened, of whom 20 were enrolled (15 [75%] with \u03b2-thalassaemia and five [25%] with \u03b1-thalassaemia) and received mitapivat. The median age of patients was 44 years (IQR 35-56), 15 (75%) of 20 patients were female, five (25%) were male, and ten (50%) identified as Asian. 16 (80% [90% CI 60-93]) of 20 patients had a haemoglobin response (p<0\u00b70001), five (100%) of five with \u03b1-thalassaemia and 11 (73%) of 15 with \u03b2-thalassaemia. 17 (85%) patients had a treatment-emergent adverse event, and 13 had a treatment-emergent event that was considered to be treatment related.

INTRODUCTION Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) is the most common cause of congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Until recently, treatment had been limited to supportive management including red blood cell transfusions, splenectomy, and management of chronic disease complications such as iron overload and decreased bone mineral density. AREAS COVERED We discuss preclinical data and phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies evaluating mitapivat for adult patients with hemolytic anemia secondary to PKD. Mitapivat has been shown to offer early and durable improvement in hemoglobin with reduction in transfusion burden, and preliminary data suggest it can induce a negative iron balance in many patients without the use of dedicated iron chelators. EXPERT OPINION Mitapivat is a first-in-class allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase and the first FDA-approved disease directed therapy for PKD. It has a favorable safety profile and clear clinical efficacy. Given the considerable genetic heterogeneity of PKD and the rapid effect on improving hemoglobin and reducing hemolysis, a therapeutic trial of mitapivat should be considered in all patients with PKD who are not homozygous for the PKLR R479H mutation. Further investigations are needed regarding long-term safety and efficacy profiles and whether long-term PKD-associated complications can be reduced or even reversed."

Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is a rare hereditary disorder affecting red cell (RBC) glycolysis, causing changes in metabolism including a deficiency in ATP. This affects red cell homeostasis, promoting premature removal of RBCs from the circulation. In this study we characterized and evaluated the effect of AG-348, an allosteric activator of PK that is currently in clinical trials for treatment of PK deficiency, on RBCs and erythroid precursors from PK-deficient patients. In 15 patients ex vivo treatment with AG-348 resulted in increased enzymatic activity in all patient cells after 24 hours (mean increase 1.8-fold, range 1.2-3.4). ATP levels increased (mean increase 1.5-fold, range 1.0-2.2) similar to control cells (mean increase 1.6-fold, range, 1.4-1.8). Generally, PK thermostability was strongly reduced in PK-deficient RBCs. Ex vivo treatment with AG-348 increased residual activity 1.4 to >10-fold than residual activity of vehicle-treated samples. Protein analyses suggests that a sufficient level of PK protein is required for cells to respond to AG-348 treatment ex-vivo, as treatment effects were minimal in patient cells with very low or undetectable levels of PK-R. In half of the patients, ex vivo treatment with AG-348 was associated with an increase in RBC deformability. These data support the hypothesis that drug intervention with AG-348 effectively upregulates PK enzymatic activity and increases stability in PK-deficient RBCs over a broad range of PKLR genotypes. The concomitant increase in ATP levels suggests that glycolytic pathway activity may be restored. AG-348 treatment may represent an attractive way to correct the underlying pathologies of PK deficiency. (AG-348 is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of PK deficiency.

BACKGROUND Pyruvate kinase deficiency is a rare, hereditary, chronic condition that is associated with hemolytic anemia. In a phase 2 study, mitapivat, an oral, first-in-class activator of erythrocyte pyruvate kinase, increased the hemoglobin level in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency. METHODS In this global, phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of mitapivat in adults with pyruvate kinase deficiency who were not receiving regular red-cell transfusions. The patients were assigned to receive either mitapivat (5 mg twice daily, with potential escalation to 20 or 50 mg twice daily) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was a hemoglobin response (an increase from baseline of \u22651.5 g per deciliter in the hemoglobin level) that was sustained at two or more scheduled assessments at weeks 16, 20, and 24. Secondary efficacy end points were the average change from baseline in the hemoglobin level, markers of hemolysis and hematopoiesis, and the change from baseline at week 24 in two pyruvate kinase deficiency-specific patient-reported outcome measures. RESULTS Sixteen of the 40 patients (40%) in the mitapivat group had a hemoglobin response, as compared with none of the 40 patients in the placebo group (adjusted difference, 39.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 24.1 to 54.6; two-sided P<0.001). Patients who received mitapivat had a greater response than those who received placebo with respect to each secondary end point, including the average change from baseline in the hemoglobin level. The most common adverse events were nausea (in 7 patients [18%] in the mitapivat group and 9 patients [23%] in the placebo group) and headache (in 6 patients [15%] and 13 patients [33%], respectively). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 10 patients (25%) who received mitapivat and 5 patients (13%) who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS In patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency, mitapivat significantly increased the hemoglobin level, decreased hemolysis, and improved patient-reported outcomes. No new safety signals were identified in the patients who received mitapivat. (Funded by Agios Pharmaceuticals; ACTIVATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03548220.)."

The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mg or 300 mg of mitapivat twice daily for a 24-week core period; eligible patients could continue treatment in an ongoing extension phase. RESULTS Common adverse events, including headache and insomnia, occurred at the time of drug initiation and were transient; 92% of the episodes of headache and 47% of the episodes of insomnia resolved within 7 days. The most common serious adverse events, hemolytic anemia and pharyngitis, each occurred in 2 patients (4%). A total of 26 patients (50%) had an increase of more than 1.0 g per deciliter in the hemoglobin level. Among these patients, the mean maximum increase was 3.4 g per deciliter (range, 1.1 to 5.8), and the median time until the first increase of more than 1.0 g per deciliter was 10 days (range, 7 to 187); 20 patients (77%) had an increase of more than 1.0 g per deciliter in the hemoglobin level at more than 50% of visits during the core study period, with improvement in markers of hemolysis. The response was sustained in all 19 patients remaining in the extension phase, with a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 22 to 35). Hemoglobin responses were observed only in patients who had at least one missense PKLR mutation and were associated with the red-cell pyruvate kinase protein level at baseline.

Viltolarsen is a drug of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) chemistry, designed to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene. It aims to produce truncated but partially functional dystrophin in DMD patients and restore muscle function. Based on a preclinical study showing the ability of antisense PMOs targeting the DMD gene to improve muscle function in a large animal model, viltolarsen was developed by Nippon Shinyaku and the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry in Japan. Following clinical trials conducted in Japan, Canada, and the United States showing significant improvements in muscle function, viltolarsen was approved for medical use in Japan in March 2020 and the United States in August 2020, respectively.

We investigated viltolarsen's ability to induce dystrophin expression and examined its safety in DMD patients. METHODS In this open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, phase 1/2, exploratory study, 16 ambulant and nonambulant males aged 5-12 years with DMD received viltolarsen 40 or 80 mg/kg/week via intravenous infusion for 24 weeks. Primary endpoints were dystrophin expression and exon 53 skipping levels. RESULTS In western blot analysis, mean changes in dystrophin expression (% normal) from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 were - 1.21 (P = 0.5136) and 1.46 (P = 0.1636), respectively, in the 40 mg/kg group, and 0.76 (P = 0.2367) and 4.81 (P = 0.0536), respectively, in the 80 mg/kg group.

Patients receiving 80 mg/kg showed a higher mean exon 53 skipping level (42.4%) than those receiving 40 mg/kg (21.8%). All adverse events were judged to be mild or moderate in intensity and none led to study discontinuation. INTERPRETATION Treatment with viltolarsen 40 or 80 mg/kg elicited an increasing trend in dystrophin expression and exon 53 skipping levels, and was safe and well tolerated. The decline in motor function appeared less marked in patients with higher dystrophin levels; this may warrant further investigation.

Importance An unmet need remains for safe and efficacious treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). To date, there are limited agents available that address the underlying cause of the disease. Objective To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of viltolarsen, a novel antisense oligonucleotide, in participants with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping. Design, Setting, and Participants This phase 2 study was a 4-week randomized clinical trial for safety followed by a 20-week open-label treatment period of patients aged 4 to 9 years with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping. To enroll 16 participants, with 8 participants in each of the 2 dose cohorts, 17 participants were screened. Study enrollment occurred between December 16, 2016, and August 17, 2017, at sites in the US and Canada. Data were collected from December 2016 to February 2018, and data were analyzed from April 2018 to May 2019. Interventions Participants received 40 mg/kg (low dose) or 80 mg/kg (high dose) of viltolarsen administered by weekly intravenous infusion. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes of the trial included safety, tolerability, and de novo dystrophin protein production measured by Western blot in participants' biceps muscles. Secondary outcomes included additional assessments of dystrophin mRNA and protein production as well as clinical muscle strength and function. Results Of the 16 included boys with DMD, 15 (94%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 7.4 (1.8) years. After 20 to 24 weeks of treatment, significant drug-induced dystrophin production was seen in both viltolarsen dose cohorts (40 mg/kg per week: mean [range] 5.7% [3.2-10.3] of normal; 80 mg/kg per week: mean [range] 5.9% [1.1-14.4] of normal). Viltolarsen was well tolerated; no treatment-emergent adverse events required dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation of the study drug. No serious adverse events or deaths occurred during the study. Compared with 65 age-matched and treatment-matched natural history controls, all 16 participants treated with viltolarsen showed significant improvements in timed function tests from baseline, including time to stand from supine (viltolarsen: -0.19 s; control: 0.66 s), time to run/walk 10 m (viltolarsen: 0.23 m/s; control: -0.04 m/s), and 6-minute walk test (viltolarsen: 28.9 m; control: -65.3 m) at the week 25 visit. Conclusions and Relevance Systemic treatment of participants with DMD with viltolarsen induced de novo dystrophin production, and clinical improvement of timed function tests was observed.

Viltolarsen is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (PMO) designed to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), one of the most common lethal genetic disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles and cardiomyopathy. It was developed by Nippon Shinyaku in collaboration with the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP) in Japan based on the preclinical studies conducted in the DMD dog model at the NCNP. After showing hopeful results in pre-clinical trials and several clinical trials across North America and Japan, it received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for DMD in 2020. Viltolarsen restores the reading frame of the DMD gene by skipping exon 53 and produces a truncated but functional form of dystrophin. It can treat approximately 8-10% of the DMD patient population. This paper aims to summarize the development of viltolarsen from preclinical trials to clinical trials to, finally, FDA approval, and discusses the challenges that come with fighting DMD using antisense therapy."

BACKGROUND Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, genetic disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene resulting in an absence of functional dystrophin protein. Viltolarsen, an exon 53 skipping therapy, has been shown to increase endogenous dystrophin levels. Herein, long-term (>2 years) functional outcomes in viltolarsen treated patients were compared to a matched historical control group. OBJECTIVE To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of the anti-sense oligonucleotide viltolarsen in the treatment of patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy. METHODS This trial (NCT03167255) is the extension of a previously published 24-week trial in North America (NCT02740972) that examined dystrophin levels, timed function tests compared to a matched historical control group (Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study, CINRG DNHS), and safety in boys 4 to < 10 years (N = 16) with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping who were treated with viltolarsen. Both groups were treated with glucocorticoids. All 16 participants elected to enroll in this long-term trial (up to 192 weeks) to continue evaluation of motor function and safety. RESULTS Time to stand from supine and time to run/walk 10 meters showed stabilization from baseline through week 109 for viltolarsen-treated participants whereas the historical control group showed decline (statistically significant differences for multiple timepoints). Safety was similar to that observed in the previous 24-week trial, which was predominantly mild. There have been no treatment-related serious adverse events and no discontinuations. CONCLUSIONS Based on these results at over 2 years, viltolarsen can be a new treatment option for patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most common lethal muscle-wasting disorders affecting young boys caused by mutations in the DMD gene. Exon skipping has emerged as a promising therapy for DMD. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) are designed to induce the skipping of exon(s), in order to restore the reading frame, and therefore, allow for dystrophin expression. Eteplirsen and golodirsen, AONs for DMD exons 51 and 53 skipping, have been recently approved by the FDA. Viltolarsen, an AON for DMD exon 53 skipping, was approved in Japan earlier this year. Although promising, the efficacy of eteplirsen and AON sequence employed remain controversial. In addition, exon skipping faces challenges including the applicability and delivery. This article reviews and discusses exon skipping and the current advances being made in the field, on drugs, multi-exon skipping, sequence design, and applicability. We also discuss challenges and future directions that will facilitate the development of exon skipping therapy."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common lethal X-linked genetic disorder, characterized by progressive muscle loss, with cardiac and respiratory complications. It is caused by a lack of dystrophin protein due to mutations in the DMD gene, which can disrupt the reading frame of the dystrophin primary transcript. Antisense oligonucleotides such as phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) can induce exon skipping during pre-mRNA splicing and restore the reading frame of the DMD primary transcript. The resulting dystrophin protein is internally deleted but partially functional.

Background and Objectives Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has a clinical presentation ranging from an asymptomatic course to flu-like syndrome up to respiratory failure. Seasonal Influenza, due to the influenza viruses and very common in children, can cause symptoms similar to COVID-19. In order to identify clinical and laboratory characteristics that allow healthcare workers to differentiate COVID-19 from Influenza, we performed a systematic review of the existing literature on the pediatric age. Methods. The research was done via PubMed for articles published from March 2020 to October 2021, combining the MeSH words \"COVID-19\" and \"Influenza\" and \"Children\" and considering the suggestions of the PRISMA Group. Results The most frequently described symptoms were fever and cough in both groups. In most studies, high fever, cough, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, vomiting, and muscle pain were detected more frequently in the Influenza group. Regarding the value of laboratory tests, the results were mixed. Almost all studies reported significantly lower levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in the COVID-19 group than in the Influenza group. In most manuscripts, COVID-19 had a milder course than Influenza. Conclusions No symptoms are characteristic of a single infectious agent, with flu-like disorders being the most common. In addition, laboratory tests do not help in the differential diagnosis; however, they show a limited inflammatory response in COVID-19, which could explain the fewer complications compared to adulthood, with a less severe clinical course."

Thus, identifying clinical features that are strongly associated with COVID-19 in comparison to other respiratory viruses can aid risk stratification and testing prioritization especially in situations where resources for virological testing and resources for isolation facilities are limited. In our retrospective cohort study comparing the clinical presentation of COVID-19 and other respiratory viral infections, we found that anosmia and dysgeusia were symptoms independently associated with COVID-19 and can be important differentiating symptoms in patients presenting with acute respiratory illness. On the other hand, laboratory abnormalities and radiological findings were not statistically different between the two groups. In comparing outcomes, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to need high dependency or intensive care unit care and had a longer median length of stay.

BACKGROUND An understanding of differences in clinical phenotypes and outcomes COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viral infections is important to optimise the management of patients and plan healthcare. Herein we sought to investigate such differences in patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory viruses. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalised adults and children (\u226415 years) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus A/B, RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus, seasonal coronaviruses, adenovirus or bocavirus in a respiratory sample at admission between 2011 and 2020. RESULTS A total of 6321 adult (1721 SARS-CoV-2) and 6379 paediatric (101 SARS-CoV-2) healthcare episodes were included in the study. In adults, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was independently associated with younger age, male sex, overweight/obesity, diabetes and hypertension, tachypnoea as well as better haemodynamic measurements, white cell count, platelet count and creatinine values. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was associated with higher 30-day mortality as compared with influenza (adjusted HR (aHR) 4.43, 95% CI 3.51 to 5.59), RSV (aHR 3.81, 95% CI 2.72 to 5.34) and other respiratory viruses (aHR 3.46, 95% CI 2.61 to 4.60), as well as higher 90-day mortality, ICU admission, ICU mortality and pulmonary embolism in adults. In children, patients with SARS-CoV-2 were older and had lower prevalence of chronic cardiac and respiratory diseases compared with other viruses.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a global health threat with the potential to cause severe disease manifestations in the lungs. Although COVID-19 has been extensively characterized clinically, the factors distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory viruses are unknown. Here, we compared the clinical, histopathological, and immunological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and pandemic influenza A(H1N1). We observed a higher frequency of respiratory symptoms, increased tissue injury markers, and a histological pattern of alveolar pneumonia in pandemic influenza A(H1N1) patients. Conversely, dry cough, gastrointestinal symptoms and interstitial lung pathology were observed in COVID-19 cases. Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) was characterized by higher levels of IL-1RA, TNF-\u03b1, CCL3, G-CSF, APRIL, sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2, sCD30, and sCD163. Meanwhile, COVID-19 displayed an immune profile distinguished by increased Th1 (IL-12, IFN-\u03b3) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) cytokine levels, along with IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CCL11, VEGF, TWEAK, TSLP, MMP-1, and MMP-3. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces a dysbalanced polyfunctional inflammatory response that is different from the immune response against pandemic influenza A(H1N1).

The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) not only poses a serious threat to the health of people worldwide but also affects the global economy. The outbreak of COVID-19 began in December 2019, at the same time as the influenza season. However, as the treatments and prognoses of COVID-19 and influenza are different, it is important to accurately differentiate these two different respiratory tract infections on the basis of their respective early-stage characteristics. We reviewed official documents and news released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), the United States CDC, and the World Health Organization (WHO), and we also searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Excerpta Medica database (Embase), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, preprinted bioRxiv and medRxiv databases for documents and guidelines from earliest available date up until October 3rd, 2020. We obtained the latest information about COVID-19 and influenza and summarized and compared their biological characteristics, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathological mechanisms, treatments, and prognostic factors. We show that although COVID-19 and influenza are different in many ways, there are numerous similarities; thus, in addition to using nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody-based approaches, clinicians and epidemiologists should distinguish between the two using their respective characteristics in early stages. We should utilize experiences from other epidemics to provide additional guidance for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19."

This disease is more contagious than influenza such that cluster outbreaks occur frequently. If patients with symptoms quickly underwent testing and contact tracing, these outbreaks could be contained. Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients have symptoms similar to other common illnesses. Here, we hypothesize the order of symptom occurrence could help patients and medical professionals more quickly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases, yet such essential information is largely unavailable. To this end, we apply a Markov Process to a graded partially ordered set based on clinical observations of COVID-19 cases to ascertain the most likely order of discernible symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) in COVID-19 patients. We then compared the progression of these symptoms in COVID-19 to other respiratory diseases, such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, to observe if the diseases present differently. Our model predicts that influenza initiates with cough, whereas COVID-19 like other coronavirus-related diseases initiates with fever. However, COVID-19 differs from SARS and MERS in the order of gastrointestinal symptoms. Our results support the notion that fever should be used to screen for entry into facilities as regions begin to reopen after the outbreak of Spring 2020. Additionally, our findings suggest that good clinical practice should involve recording the order of symptom occurrence in COVID-19 and other diseases. If such a systemic clinical practice had been standard since ancient diseases, perhaps the transition from local outbreak to pandemic could have been avoided."

The performance for SARS-CoV-2 detection was determined using 298 specimens from patients reporting COVID-19 symptoms within 7 days from symptom onset (DSO) in comparison with the Lyra SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase PCR) assay (\"Lyra SARS-CoV-2\") as the reference. The performance for flu A and flu B detection was determined using 75 influenza-positive and 40 influenza-negative retrospective specimens in comparison with the previously FDA-cleared BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B assay (\"Veritor Flu\") as the reference. The Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay met the FDA EUA acceptance criteria (86.7%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 75.8 to 93.1) for SARS-CoV-2 testing compared to Lyra SARS-CoV-2. The Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay also demonstrated 100% agreement with the Veritor Flu for Flu A+B assay. For flu A detection, the lower bound of the 95% CI was 91.2%; for flu B detection, the lower bound was 90.0%. The dual detection capability of Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu for the etiologic agents causing COVID-19 and flu will allow efficient differentiation between the two illnesses, inform disease management, and facilitate optimal treatment.

Luminopsins (LMOs) are chimeric proteins consisting of a luciferase fused to an opsin that provide control of neuronal activity, allowing for less cumbersome and less invasive optogenetic manipulation. It was previously shown that both an external light source and the luciferase substrate, coelenterazine (CTZ), could modulate activity of LMO-expressing neurons, although the magnitudes of the photoresponses remained subpar. In this study, we created an enhanced iteration of the excitatory luminopsin LMO3, termed eLMO3, that has improved membrane targeting due to the insertion of a Golgi trafficking signal sequence. In cortical neurons in culture, the expression of eLMO3 resulted in significant reductions in the formation of intracellular aggregates, as well as in a significant increase in total photocurrents. Furthermore, we corroborated the findings with injections of adeno-associated viral vectors into the deep layers of the somatosensory cortex (the barrel cortex) of male mice. We observed greatly reduced numbers of intracellular puncta in eLMO3-expressing cortical neurons compared to those expressing the original LMO3. Finally, we quantified CTZ-driven behavior, namely whisker-touching behavior, in male mice with LMO3 expression in the barrel cortex. After CTZ administration, mice with eLMO3 displayed significantly longer whisker responses than mice with LMO3. In summary, we have engineered the superior LMO by resolving membrane trafficking defects, and we demonstrated improved membrane targeting, greater photocurrents, and greater functional responses to stimulate with CTZ."

Previous work has demonstrated that fusion of a luciferase to an opsin, to create a luminescent opsin or luminopsin, provides a genetically encoded means of manipulating neuronal activity via both chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches. Here we have expanded and refined the versatility of luminopsin tools by fusing an alternative luciferase variant with high light emission, Gaussia luciferase mutant GLucM23, to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing channelrhodopsins with increased light sensitivity. The combination of GLucM23 with Volvox channelrhodopsin-1 produced LMO4, while combining GLucM23 with the anion channelrhodopsin iChloC yielded iLMO4. We found efficient activation of these channelrhodopsins in the presence of the luciferase substrate, as indicated by responses measured in both single neurons and in neuronal populations of mice and rats, as well as by changes in male rat behavior during amphetamine-induced rotations. We conclude that these new luminopsins will be useful for bimodal opto- and chemogenetic analyses of brain function."

In Bioluminescent Optogenetics (BL-OG) a biological, rather than a physical, light source is used to activate light-sensing opsins, such as channelrhodopsins or pumps. This is commonly achieved by utilizing a luminopsin (LMO), a fusion protein of a light-emitting luciferase tethered to a light-sensing opsin. Light of the wavelength matching the activation peak of the opsin is emitted by the luciferase upon application of its small molecule luciferin, resulting in activation of the fused opsin and subsequent effects on membrane potential. Using optimized protocols for culturing, transforming, and testing primary neurons in multi electrode arrays, we systematically defined parameters under which changes in neuronal activity are specific to bioluminescent activation of opsins, rather than due to off-target effects of either the luciferin or its solvent on neurons directly, or on opsins directly. We further tested if there is a direct effect of bioluminescence on neurons. Critical for assuring specific BL-OG effects are testing the concentration and formulation of the luciferin against proper controls, including testing effects of vehicle on LMO expressing and of luciferin on nonLMO expressing targets."

Luminopsins are fusion proteins of luciferase and opsin that allow interrogation of neuronal circuits at different temporal and spatial resolutions by choosing either extrinsic physical or intrinsic biological light for its activation. Building on previous development of fusions of wild-type Gaussia luciferase with channelrhodopsin, here we expanded the utility of luminopsins by fusing bright Gaussia luciferase variants with either channelrhodopsin to excite neurons (luminescent opsin, LMO) or a proton pump to inhibit neurons (inhibitory LMO, iLMO). These improved LMOs could reliably activate or silence neurons in vitro and in vivo. Expression of the improved LMO in hippocampal circuits not only enabled mapping of synaptic activation of CA1 neurons with fine spatiotemporal resolution but also could drive rhythmic circuit excitation over a large spatiotemporal scale. Furthermore, virus-mediated expression of either LMO or iLMO in the substantia nigra in vivo produced not only the expected bidirectional control of single unit activity but also opposing effects on circling behavior in response to systemic injection of a luciferase substrate. Thus, although preserving the ability to be activated by external light sources, LMOs expand the use of optogenetics by making the same opsins accessible to noninvasive, chemogenetic control, thereby allowing the same probe to manipulate neuronal activity over a range of spatial and temporal scales."

The ability to manipulate specific neuronal populations of the spinal cord following spinal cord injury (SCI) could prove highly beneficial for rehabilitation in patients through maintaining and strengthening still existing neuronal connections and/or facilitating the formation of new connections. A non-invasive and highly specific approach to neuronal stimulation is bioluminescent-optogenetics (BL-OG), where genetically expressed light emitting luciferases are tethered to light sensitive channelrhodopsins (luminopsins, LMO); neurons are activated by the addition of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ). This approach utilizes ion channels for current conduction while activating the channels through the application of a small chemical compound, thus allowing non-invasive stimulation and recruitment of all targeted neurons. Rats were transduced in the lumbar spinal cord with AAV2/9 to express the excitatory LMO3 under control of a pan-neuronal or motor neuron-specific promoter. A day after contusion injury of the thoracic spine, rats received either CTZ or vehicle every other day for 2 weeks. Activation of either neuron population below the level of injury significantly improved locomotor recovery lasting beyond the treatment window. Utilizing histological and gene expression methods we identified neuronal plasticity as a likely mechanism underlying the functional recovery. These findings provide a foundation for a rational approach to spinal cord injury rehabilitation, thereby advancing approaches for functional recovery after SCI.

Optogenetic techniques provide an unprecedented ability to precisely manipulate neural activity in the context of complex neural circuitry. Although the toolbox of optogenetic probes continues to expand at a rapid pace with more efficient and responsive reagents, hardware-based light delivery is still a major hurdle that limits its practical use in vivo. We have bypassed the challenges of external light delivery by directly coupling a bioluminescent light source (a genetically encoded luciferase) to an inhibitory opsin, which we term an inhibitory luminopsin (iLMO). iLMO was shown to suppress action potential firing and synchronous bursting activity in vitro in response to both external light and luciferase substrate. iLMO was further shown to suppress single-unit firing rate and local field potentials in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. Finally, expression of iLMO was scaled up to multiple structures of the basal ganglia to modulate rotational behavior of freely moving animals in a hardware-independent fashion.

Although molecular tools for controlling neuronal activity by light have vastly expanded, there are still unmet needs which require development and refinement. For example, light delivery into the brain is still a major practical challenge that hinders potential translation of optogenetics in human patients. In addition, it would be advantageous to manipulate neuronal activity acutely and precisely as well as chronically and non-invasively, using the same genetic construct in animal models. We have previously addressed these challenges by employing bioluminescence and have created a new line of opto-chemogenetic probes termed luminopsins by fusing light-sensing opsins with light-emitting luciferases. In this report, we incorporated Chlamydomonas channelrhodopsin 2 with step-function mutations as the opsin moiety in the new luminopsin fusion protein termed step-function luminopsin (SFLMO). Bioluminescence-induced photocurrent lasted longer than the bioluminescence signal due to very slow deactivation of the mutated channel. In addition, bioluminescence was able to activate most of the channels on the cell surface due to the extremely high light sensitivity of the channel. This efficient channel activation was partly mediated by radiationless bioluminescence resonance energy transfer due to the proximity of luciferase and opsin. To test the utility of SFLMOs in vivo, we transduced the substantia nigra unilaterally via a viral vector in male rats. Injection of the luciferase substrate as well as conventional photostimulation via fiber optics elicited circling behaviors. Thus, SFLMOs expand the current approaches for manipulation of neuronal activity in the brain and add more versatility and practicality to optogenetics in freely behaving animals."

Functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is poor, mainly due to the slow and incomplete regeneration of injured axons. Experimental therapies that increase the excitability of the injured axons have proven remarkably successful in promoting regeneration, but their clinical applicability has been limited. Bioluminescent optogenetics (BL-OG) uses luminopsins, fusion proteins of light-generating luciferase and light-sensing ion channels that could be used to increase neuronal excitability if exposed to a suitable substrate. Excitatory luminopsins were expressed in motoneurons of transgenic mice and in wildtype mice transduced with adeno-associated viral vectors. Intraperitoneal administration of coelenterazine (CTZ), a known luciferase substrate, generated intense bioluminescence in peripheral axons. This bioluminescence increased motoneuron excitability. A single administration of CTZ immediately after sciatic nerve transection and repair markedly enhanced motor axon regeneration. Compound muscle action potentials were 3-4 times larger than controls by 4 weeks after injury. The results observed with transgenic mice were comparable to those of mice in which the luminopsin was expressed using viral vectors. Significantly more motoneurons had successfully reinnervated muscle targets four weeks after nerve injury in BL-OG treated mice than in controls.

The need to develop efficient therapies for neurodegenerative diseases is urgent, especially given the increasing percentages of the population living longer, with increasing chances of being afflicted with conditions like Parkinson's disease (PD). A promising curative approach toward PD and other neurodegenerative diseases is the transplantation of stem cells to halt and potentially reverse neuronal degeneration. However, stem cell therapy does not consistently lead to improvement for patients. Using remote stimulation to optogenetically activate transplanted cells, we attempted to improve behavioral outcomes of stem cell transplantation. We generated a neuronal precursor cell line expressing luminopsin 3 (LMO3), a luciferase-channelrhodopsin fusion protein, which responds to the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ) with emission of blue light that in turn activates the opsin. Neuronal precursor cells were injected bilaterally into the striatum of homozygous aphakia mice, which carry a spontaneous mutation leading to lack of dopaminergic neurons and symptoms of PD. Following transplantation, the cells were stimulated over a period of 10 days by intraventricular injections of CTZ. Mice receiving CTZ demonstrated significantly improved motor skills in a rotarod test compared to mice receiving vehicle. Thus, bioluminescent optogenetic stimulation of transplanted neuronal precursor cells shows promising effects in improving locomotor behavior in the aphakia PD mouse model and encourages further studies to elucidate the mechanisms and long-term outcomes of these beneficial effects."

CDK9 is a prominent member of the transcriptional CDKs subfamily, a group of kinases whose function is to control the primary steps of mRNA synthesis and processing by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II. As a cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK9 activation in vivo depends upon its association with T-type cyclins to assemble the positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb). Although CDK9/P-TEFb phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNAP II in the same positions targeted by CDK7 (TFIIH) and CDK8 (Mediator), the former does not participate in the transcription initiation, but rather plays a unique role by driving the polymerase to productive elongation. In addition to RNAP II CTD, the negative transcription elongation factors DSIF and NELF also represent major CDK9 substrates, whose phosphorylation is required to overcome the proximal pause of the polymerase. CDK9 is recruited to specific genes through proteins that interact with both P-TEFb and distinct elements in DNA, RNA or chromatin, where it modulates the activity of individual RNAP II transcription complexes. The regulation of CDK9 function is an intricate network that includes post-translational modifications (phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and acetylation/deacetylation of key residues) as well as the association of P-TEFb with various proteins that can stimulate or inhibit its kinase activity. Several cases of CDK9 deregulation have been linked to important human diseases, including various types of cancer and also AIDS (due to its essential role in HIV replication). Not only HIV, but also many other human viruses have been shown to depend strongly on CDK9 activity to be transcribed within host cells. This review summarizes the main advances made on CDK9/P-TEFb field in more than 20 years, introducing the structural, functional and genetic aspects that have been elucidated ever since."

CDK9-cyclin K also interacts with ATR and other DNA damage response and DNA repair proteins. CDK9 accumulates on chromatin and limits the amount of single-stranded DNA in response to replication stress.

Transcriptomic mapping of CDKs in breast cancer demonstrated that the expression of CDK9 predicted a detrimental outcome in basal-like tumors (HR = 1.51, CI = 1.08-2.11, p = 0.015) and, particularly, in the luminal B subtype with HER2+ expression (HR = 1.82, CI = 1.17-2.82, p = 0.0069). The novel CDK9 PROTAC, THAL-SNS-032, displayed a profound inhibitory activity in MCF7, T47D, and BT474 cells, with less effect in SKBR3, HCC1569, HCC1954, MDA-MB-231, HS578T, and BT549 cells. The three cell lines with HER2 overexpression and no presence of ER, SKBR3, HCC1569, and HCC1954 displayed an EC50 three times higher compared to ER-positive and dual ER/HER2-positive cell lines. BT474-derived trastuzumab-resistant cell lines displayed a particular sensitivity to THAL-SNS-032. Western blot analyses showed that THAL-SNS-032 caused a decrease in CDK9 levels in BT474, BT474-RH, and BT474-TDM1R cells, and a significant increase in apoptosis. Experiments in animals demonstrated an inverse therapeutic index of THAL-SNS-032, with doses in the nontherapeutic and toxic range. The identified toxicity was mainly due to an on-target off-tumor effect of the compound in the gastrointestinal epithelium. In summary, the potent and efficient antitumoral properties of the CDK9 PROTAC THAL-SNS-032 opens the possibility of using this type of compound in breast cancer only if specifically delivered to cancer cells, particularly in ER/HER2-positive and HER2-resistant tumors."

Further, we have discussed the selectivity aspects among CDKs, the clinical trial dose-limiting toxicities, and highlighted the most advanced clinical candidates. We also discuss the changing paradigm towards selective inhibitors and an overview of ATP-binding pockets of all druggable CDKs. We carefully analyzed the clinical pipeline to unravel the candidates that are currently under active clinical development. In addition to the plenty of dual CDK4/6 inhibitors, there are many selective CDK7, CDK9, and CDK8/19 inhibitors in the clinical pipeline."

                    "text": "CDK9 keeps RNA polymerase II on track. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), the kinase component of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), is essential for transcription of most protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). By releasing promoter-proximally paused RNAPII into gene bodies, CDK9 controls the entry of RNAPII into productive elongation and is, therefore, critical for efficient synthesis of full-length messenger (m)RNAs. In recent years, new players involved in P-TEFb-dependent processes have been identified and an important function of CDK9 in coordinating elongation with transcription initiation and termination has been unveiled. As the regulatory functions of CDK9 in gene expression continue to expand, a number of human pathologies, including cancers, have been associated with aberrant CDK9 activity, underscoring the need to properly regulate CDK9. Here, I provide an overview of CDK9 function and regulation, with an emphasis on CDK9 dysregulation in human diseases."
